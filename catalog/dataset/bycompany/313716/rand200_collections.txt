313716_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom.
313716_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "Hardinge," "we," "us," "our," "the Company" or similar references mean Hardinge Inc. and its predecessors together with its subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metal-cutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and accessories related to those machines.
313716_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_11_ITEM1_P9_S4	The grinding machines of Kellenberger, which are manufactured in both computer and manually controlled models, are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by the Hauser and Tschudin grinding brands.
313716_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2010, the Company established Jones Shipman Grinding Limited after acquiring the assets of Jones and Shipman, a UK-based manufacturer of grinding and super-abrasive machines and machining systems.
313716_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Jones Shipman manufactures and distributes a range of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed and cylindrical) machines used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Machining centers cut material differently than a turning machine.
313716_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	These machines are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	We supply a broad line of machining centers under the Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds and powers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection and tooling movement for a specific part and then store that program in memory for future use.
313716_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements and partnerships.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Products are introduced each year to both broaden our product offering and to take advantage of new technologies available to us.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites and exotic materials.
313716_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes and which also may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	On many of our machines, multiple options are available which allow customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Certain parts on machines wear over time or break through misuse.
313716_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which is generally measured in multiple years.
313716_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, we offer an extensive line of accessories including workholding, toolholding and other industrial support products, which may be used on both our machines and those produced by others.
313716_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, Netherlands, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_11_ITEM1_P24_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2010, we restructured our U.S. sales channels from a joint distributor network and direct sales force to a new group of distributors.
313716_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	These new distribution partners have exclusive sales, service, and support responsibilities for Hardinge and Bridgeport branded machines and repair parts in virtually all of the United States, with the exception of kneemills and workholding accessories, where they will operate on a non-exclusive basis.
313716_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Additionally, members of this new distributor network will act as agents for our grinding products working with our direct technical team.
313716_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our non-machine products are sold in the U.S. mainly through direct telephone orders to a toll-free telephone number and via our web site.
313716_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products through publication of general catalogues and other targeted catalogues, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We have a substantial presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for workholding, rotary, and kneemill products.
313716_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	A substantial portion of our sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	A customer who is a supplier to the consumer electronics industry accounted for 10.7% of our consolidated sales in 2010, and one customer who is a supplier to the automotive industry accounted for 6.8% of our consolidated sales in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Hardinge Inc. operates in a single business segment, industrial machine tools.
313716_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We compete in the various segments of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding and workholding.
313716_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We compete with numerous vendors in each market segment we serve.
313716_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service and technological characteristics.
313716_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level they can achieve.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as Mori-Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma, which are based in Japan, and DMG, which is based in Germany.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes to some degree from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as several smaller Taiwanese and Korean companies.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss Company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamota in Japan, and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_11_ITEM1_P37_S5	Our accessories products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our market segments may increase.
313716_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Also, the composition of competitors may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	As we expand into new market segments, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We produce certain of our lathes, knee-mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Kellenberger grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	machining centers and lathes at both Hardinge Taiwan in Nan Tou, Taiwan and Hardinge Machine (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, China.
313716_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption, however with the recent increase in demand driven by worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ballscrews, and linear guides have had difficulty meeting demand, which could impact our production schedules in the future.
313716_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	In 2009, we began strategic changes within our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility, which historically was vertically integrated with machining operations converting parts from raw castings to finished goods, the costs of which proved to be prohibitive.
313716_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	We have moved towards a more variable cost business model, outsourcing many of the non-critical components and subassemblies for machines which were being made in the Elmira facility.
313716_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	In conjunction with our decision to outsource certain parts and subassemblies, we identified certain property, plant and equipment that was no longer required for our manufacturing operations and sold them in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	We purchase these components for our lathes and machining centers primarily from Fanuc Limited, a large Japanese electronics company and Heidenhain, a German control supplier.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	We also utilize controls from Siemens, another German control manufacturer, on certain machine models in our line of machining centers.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	On our grinding machines we offer Heidenhain and Fanuc controls.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S4	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S5	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_11_ITEM1_P43_S6	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $9.4 million, $9.3 million and $9.8 million, in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Although Hardinge Inc. holds several patents with respect to certain of its products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	Historically, we have experienced reduced activity during the third quarter of the year, largely as a result of vacations scheduled at our U.S. and European customers' plants and our policy of closing our U.S. and Switzerland facilities for two weeks during the third quarter.
313716_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	through 2010, due to the economic crisis (discussed further in Item 1A-Risk Factors), our third-quarter net sales, income from operations and net income typically have been the lowest of any quarter during the year.
313716_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	However, given the larger percentage of our sales now from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns by us and our customers due to the Chinese New Year may impact first quarter net sales, income from operations and net income and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines are typically from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to ocean travel times, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	In those cases the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available workholding and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations.
313716_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Activities at properties we own or previously owned and on adjacent areas have resulted in environmental impacts.
313716_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	In particular, our Elmira, New York manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, New York.
313716_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Hardinge, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation, and Toshiba America, Inc., the Potentially Responsible Parties (the PRPs") have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	The cost of the RI/FS was estimated to be approximately $0.84 million.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S4	We estimate our portion of the study to be $0.12 million for which we have established a reserve of $0.13 million.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S5	As of December 31, 2010 we have incurred total expenses of $0.12 million with respect to the study and other activities relating to the Site.
313716_11_ITEM1_P62_S6	The remaining reserve balance at December 31, 2010 is $0.01 million.
313716_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	The PRPs developed a Draft RI/FS with their consultants and, following EPA comments, submitted a Revised RI/FS on December 6, 2007.
313716_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and submitted a Draft Site Characterization Report to EPA in the fall.
313716_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	The PRPs currently are performing Risk Assessments in accordance with the Remedial Investigation portion of the RI/FS.
313716_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice, Hardinge had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had we received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the site.
313716_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond and found no evidence that our operations or property have or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	Other than as described above, we have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available, that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to Hardinge.
313716_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2010 Hardinge Inc. employed 1,189 persons, 363 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
313716_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	Management believes that relations with its employees are good.
313716_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A-Risk Factors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge Inc. could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in the Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by the current global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Many of our customers finance their purchases of our products through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or from the proceeds received in connection with an issuance of equity.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008, the global financial markets have experienced significant losses due to failures of many dominant financial institutions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	During late 2008 and early 2009, the governments of the United States and several foreign countries instituted bailout plans to assist many banks and others impacted by the economic crisis.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This crisis has resulted in, among other things, a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit, the impact of which is still being experienced today.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Additionally, many of our customers' equity values have substantially declined.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The combination of a reduction in borrowing bases under asset based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers' spending for our products and may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, this crisis and economic uncertainty has resulted in an overall decrease in consumer and business spending, which negatively impacted the need our customers have for our products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	While economic conditions during 2010 began to show signs of improvement in many of our markets, future slow or negative growth in the global economy may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future, we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Fluctuations in capacity at both OEMs and job shops; The availability of skilled machinists; The need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life; The need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way; The evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances; Our customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes; General economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs and freight rates.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In 2010, approximately 77% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Disruptions of capital and trading markets; Changes in import or export licensing requirements; Transportation delays; Civil disturbances or political instability; Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war; Currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; Changes in labor standards; Limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property; Nationalization and expropriation; Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws; Difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and Major health concerns.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Moreover, international conflicts are creating many economic and political uncertainties that are affecting the global economy.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Escalation of existing international conflicts or the occurrence of new international conflicts could severely affect our operations and demand for our products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may face trade barriers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a loss of customers or suppliers.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Trade barriers established by the United States or other countries may interfere with our ability to offer our products in those markets.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Competition and trade barriers in those countries could require us to reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions adverse to us.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition, our subsidiaries may require future equity-related financing, and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Those approvals may be required from the investment commissions or similar agencies of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local entities.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment and foreign trade, which may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; Diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business; Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development; Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; Difficulties in predicting market demand for acquired products and technologies and the resultant risk of acquiring excess or obsolete inventory; Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Acquisitions may also cause us to:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership; Increase our level of indebtedness; Assume liabilities; Record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and Become subject to litigation.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products, technologies, facilities and personnel to an inability to do so.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing facilities on acceptable terms; A deterioration in our financial condition that would violate current covenants or prohibit us from obtaining additional capital from banks, financial institutions, or investors; Extreme volatility in credit markets that increase margin or credit requirements; and Volatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including Swiss Francs, Chinese Renminbi, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollars, New Taiwanese Dollars, and Euros.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, our purchases of components in Yen, Euros, New Taiwan Dollars, Swiss Francs, and Chinese Renminbi are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We prepare our financial statements in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Foreign exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our costs and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We cannot assure you that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron castings or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on customer delivery requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	With individual machines priced as high as $1,500,000 and several machines frequently sold together as a package, a request by a customer to delay shipment at quarter end could significantly affect our quarterly results.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Historically, we have experienced reduced activity during the third quarter of the year, largely as a result of vacations scheduled at our customers' plants and our policy of closing our U.S. and Swiss facilities for two weeks in July or August.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a result, exclusive of the impact of the economic downturn experienced during 2008 and 2009, our third-quarter net sales, income from operations, and net income historically have been the lowest of any quarter during the year.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	However, given the larger percentage of our sales now from China, the impact of the one week to two week plant shut downs in China by us and our customers for the Chinese New Year, the first quarter net sales, income from operations and net income may result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income, and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our market-related value of assets recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the value of our Pension Plan Assets increased by $11.7 million due to increases in market value of the underlying assets as the world markets continued to recover from the impacts the global economic recession had on the world financial markets and related investment valuations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The future investment performance of our pension plan assets could significantly impact the plan assets and future growth of the plan assets.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans, discount rates are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Discount rates are used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	discount rate would reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and conversely, a lower discount rate would raise pension liability and the future pension expense.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and foreign plans, we consider the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	For pension accounting purposes in our U.S. based plan, which is the largest of our plans, the rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense was 8.00% for 2010 and 2009.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 5.93% at December 31, 2010 compared to 6.27% at December 31, 2009.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In our Swiss subsidiary, we have two defined benefit plans, which when taken as a whole are about as large as the U.S. defined benefit plan.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense on plan assets was 3.90% for 2010 and 5.00% for 2009.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 2.7% at December 31, 2010 compared to 3.5% at December 31, 2009.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we may be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $1.8 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2011 and approximately $2.3 million to the foreign plans in 2011.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a contribution in years beyond 2011 may be more or less than the projected 2011 contribution.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	At December 31, 2010, the excess of consolidated projected benefit obligations over plan assets was $27.1 million and the excess of consolidated accumulated benefit obligations over plan assets was $21.8 million.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	On June 15, 2009, the Company suspended future accrual of benefits under its U.S. defined benefit pension plan (which was closed to new participants in March 2004) and Company contributions to the 401(k) program were also suspended.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In November 2010, the Company permanently froze accrual of benefits for participants in the U.S. defined pension plan as well as reinstated Company contributions to the 401(k) program as of January 1, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Employees impacted by the actions related to the defined benefit plan now participate in a defined contribution plan.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in relatively small urban areas, with the exception of our Shanghai facility.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture and market our products and expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Due to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The technologies within our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In 2009, we recorded a $5.0 million inventory write-down related to the strategic decision to cease manufacturing of non-critical parts and certain machine models in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P65_S3	In 2008, we recorded $7.6 million in inventory write-downs associated with discontinued product lines and the review of other expected inventory usage patterns.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant parts of our receivables from customers.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we suffer loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	In 2010, approximately 64% of our sales were through distributors and agents.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In December 2009, we reorganized our U.S. distribution from a joint distributor network and direct sales force to a new group of distributors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P73_S3	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P73_S4	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	During 2010 and 2009, orders and related sales were impacted by order cancellations of $10.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, primarily due to the global economic conditions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P80_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Current employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Various federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and costs to terminate or layoff employees.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow:
313716_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	minimum wages; mandated health benefits; paid leaves of absence; mandatory severance payments; and tax reporting.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Activities at properties we own or previously owned and on adjacent areas have resulted in environmental impacts.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, New York.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Hardinge, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation, and Toshiba America, Inc., the Potentially Responsible Parties (the PRPs") have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S3	The cost of the RI/FS was estimated to be approximately $0.84 million.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S4	We estimate our portion of the study to be $0.12 million for which we have established a reserve of $0.13 million.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S5	As of December 31, 2010 we have incurred total expenses of $0.12 million with respect to the study and other activities relating to the Site.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P92_S6	The remaining reserve balance at December 31, 2010 is $0.01 million.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The PRPs developed a Draft RI/FS with their consultants and, following EPA comments, submitted a Revised RI/FS on December 6, 2007.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and submitted a Draft Site Characterization Report to EPA in the fall.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The PRPs currently are performing Risk Assessments in accordance with the Remedial Investigation portion of the RI/FS.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice, Hardinge had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had we received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the site.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond and found no evidence that our operations or property have or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Other than as described above, we have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available, that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to Hardinge.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	The loss of senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of seven members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P102_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P104_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:
313716_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to its operations.
313716_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	None of the litigation in which we are currently involved, individually or in the aggregate, is anticipated to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
313716_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 28, 2008, a putative class-action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York against the Company and certain former officers.
313716_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	This complaint, as amended, alleged that during the period from January 16, 2007 to February 21, 2008 the defendants made misleading statements and/or omissions relating to our business and operating results in violation of the Federal securities laws.
313716_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	On May 29, 2009, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
313716_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	By a decision and order dated February 2, 2010, the Court dismissed the class action lawsuit.
313716_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	The plaintiff did not file a notice to appeal the Court's dismissal of the lawsuit and the time to appeal expired.
313716_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table reflects the highest and lowest values at which the stock traded in each quarter of the last two years.
313716_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table also includes dividends per share, by quarter.
313716_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	At March 7, 2011, there were 3,527 holders of common stock.
313716_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	This number includes both record holders and individual participants in security position listings.
313716_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	There were no issuer repurchases of our common stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	In February 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $10.0 million of our common stock to be purchased through February 28, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	The Company repurchased 45,500 shares of its common stock at an average price of $12.72 per share under this program, through its expiration in February 2010.
313716_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The graph below compares the five-year cumulative total return for Hardinge Inc.
313716_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	Common Stock with the comparable returns for the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S.) Index, a new group of fourteen peer issuers, and our old group of eight peer issuers.
313716_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Company restructured its peer group this year based on a review and recommendation by an outside consultant Radford, an Aon Hewitt Company, that we use peer companies that have similar market capitalization and industry considerations.
313716_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	Our new peer group includes Amtech Systems Inc., Columbus McKinnon Corp., Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Flow International Corporation, Hurco Companies Inc., Kadant Inc., Ladish Company Inc., Nanometrics Inc., NN, Inc., Newport Corporation, Sifco Industries Inc., Transcat Inc., Twin Disc Inc., and Zygo Corporation.
313716_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	The companies included in our new peer group were selected based on comparability to Hardinge with respect to market capitalization, sales, manufactured products and international presence.
313716_11_ITEM5_P5_S3	Our old peer group included Circor International Inc., Flow International Corp., Hurco Companies Inc., Kadant Inc., Kaydon Corp., Magnetek Inc., NN Inc., and Sun Hydraulics Corp.
313716_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	Cumulative total return represents the change in stock price and the amount of dividends received during the indicated period, assuming reinvestment of dividends.
313716_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	The graph assumes an investment of $100 on December 31, 2005.

313716_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	* $100 invested on 12/31/05 in stock or index, including reinvestment of dividends.
313716_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (dollar amounts in thousands except per share data).
313716_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) 2009 results include a non-cash charge for impairment of $1.7 million associated with certain machinery and equipment formerly utilized in the manufacture of non-critical parts in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	2008 results include a non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $24.3 million due to the diminished value of goodwill and intangible assets in our Canadian, English, and Swiss entities.
313716_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	(2) We adopted the provisions of ASC 260 on January 1, 2009, which establishes that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
313716_11_ITEM6_P1_S3	The adoption of these provisions resulted in an increase in (loss) per share of $0.01 in 2008, and a reduction in income per share of $0.02 in 2007, and $0.01 in 2006.
313716_11_ITEM6_P1_S4	Diluted (loss) per share was impacted by an increase in (loss) per share of $0.01 in 2008, and a reduction in income per share of $0.01 in 2007 and $0.01 in 2006.
313716_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our primary business is designing, manufacturing, and distributing high-precision computer controlled metal-cutting turning, grinding and milling machines and related accessories.
313716_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States, China and the United Kingdom with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Approximately 77% of our 2010 sales were to customers outside of North America, 78% of our 2010 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 69% of our employees were outside of North America.
313716_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our machine products are considered to be capital goods and are part of what has historically been a highly cyclical industry.
313716_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our management believes that a key performance indicator is our order level as compared to industry measures of market activity levels.
313716_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	While general economic conditions around the world have improved, the global economic recession, which began in 2008, continues to have some impact on the industries in several of the regions in which we conduct business.
313716_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Reduced availability of credit has impacted our customers' ability to obtain financing.
313716_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Order volumes have improved dramatically over 2009, however, we are still below 2008 levels in some of the regions where we conduct business.
313716_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We are encouraged by the upward trend for global machine tool demand in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	Order volumes in the Asia and Other market have returned to early 2008 levels, as those economies rebound to normalized levels.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity watched by our management include world machine tool consumption (domestic production plus imports, less exports) as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report and metal-cutting machine orders as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology (AMT), the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	World machine tool consumption data as reported by the Metalworking Insiders Report shows an increase in machine tool consumption of 19% in 2010 versus a 33% decrease in consumption in 2009 due to the worldwide economic conditions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	This report indicates that consumption in China, the world's largest market, increased 38% in 2010 after remaining relatively stable over the course of 2009 versus 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Consumption in Germany, the world's second largest market, decreased by 9% in 2010 versus 2009 as measured in local currencies, and decreased 41% in 2009 compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	In the United Kingdom, machine tool consumption measured in pound sterling increased by 6% in 2010 versus 2009 and decreased by 40% in 2009 versus 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	Machine tool consumption in the U.S. decreased by 15% in 2010 versus 2009 compared to a decrease of 51% in 2009 compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S6	In 2010, U.S. orders for metal-cutting machine tools reported by the AMT increased 85.3% versus 2009 as a result of the economic recovery in the U.S. market.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S7	In 2009 orders declined by 60.4% versus 2008, primarily related to the sharp decline in world-wide order activity brought on by the global economic conditions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S8	The AMT's statistics are reported on a voluntary basis from member companies.
313716_11_ITEM7_P4_S9	The report includes metal-cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete.
313716_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that might purchase our products.
313716_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	One such measurement is the PMI (formerly called the Purchasing Manager's Index), as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Similar information regarding machine tool consumption in foreign countries is published in various trade journals.
313716_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, accessories, repair parts, and service revenue, have typically accounted for approximately 25% of overall sales and are an important part of our business, especially in the U.S. where Hardinge has an installed base of thousands of machines.
313716_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Sales of these products do not vary on a year-to-year basis as significantly as capital goods, but demand does typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales and orders, gross profit as a percent of net sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The current global recessionary conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our bank financing arrangements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are also subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We also expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	We continue to monitor our customers' financial condition in order to mitigate our accounts receivable collectability risks.
313716_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan which causes the worldwide valuation of the Japanese Yen, Euro, Swiss Franc, South Korean Won, and New Taiwanese Dollar to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Also, we translate the results of our Swiss, Taiwanese, Chinese, British, German, French, Dutch and Canadian subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes.
313716_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Period to period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the U.S. Dollar may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.

313716_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	In December 2010, we renewed our $10.0 million secured revolving credit facility which was due March 31, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The new maturity date is March 31, 2012.
313716_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	There are no amounts outstanding under this credit facility as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In June 2010, we amended our working capital facility at our Swiss subsidiary to provide for borrowing of up to CHF 6.0 million ($6.4 million equivalent) from the original amount of up to CHF 5.0 million ($5.4 million equivalent), to be used as a limit for cash credits in the form of fixed advances in CHF and/or in any other freely convertible foreign currencies with maximum terms of up to 36 months.
313716_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The credit facility is secured by real property owned by Kellenberger.
313716_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no borrowings under this working capital facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The credit facility now provides for the entire amount to be available for guarantees, documentary credit, and margin cover for foreign exchange trades and of which up to CHF 5.0 million ($5.4 million equivalent) of the facility can be used for working capital.
313716_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The amendment terminates on September 1, 2013 and the credit agreement reverts to its original terms of CHF 7.0 million ($7.5 million equivalent) of which up to CHF 3.0 million ($3.2 million equivalent) is available for working capital needs.
313716_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	In July 2010, Hardinge Machine Tools B.V., Taiwan Branch entered into a new unsecured credit facility replacing their existing $5.0 million facility.

313716_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details on all of the above credit facilities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table summarizes certain financial data for year 2010 and 2009:
313716_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	(1) EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
313716_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	EBITDA is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe, provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.
313716_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Orders for 2010 were $296.7 million, an increase of $121.7 million or 70% compared to 2009 orders of $175.0 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Worldwide demand for machine tools improved during 2010 as reflected in the increases in orders for all of our major markets compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Reduced orders levels and order cancellation activity in 2009 were directly related to the global economic recession and related financial crisis which affected all of the regions and product lines in which we conduct business, and was generally consistent with overall industry statistics.
313716_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Asia and Other represents 47% of the Company's total orders for 2010 driven by a $35.8 million order in China from a supplier to the consumer electronics industry.
313716_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on new orders of approximately $2.5 million for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table presents 2010 and 2009 new orders by region:
313716_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	North American orders increased by $14.7 million or 28% for 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in North American orders was driven by strong machine orders which were up $9.4 million or 40% in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in machine orders can be attributed to the global economy rebounding from the recessionary conditions as well as a successful transition to our new U.S. distributors.
313716_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	European orders increased by $40.4 million or 80% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The acquisition of Jones Shipman in April of 2010 was responsible for 25% of this increase.
313716_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Exclusive of Jones Shipman, the increase in orders for the year was driven by strong machine order activity in Turkey, Germany, and Russia.
313716_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on orders for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year was favorable by $1.3 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Asia Other orders increased by $66.6 million or 92% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase was driven by $35.8 million in orders in China for the year from a supplier to the consumer electronics industry.
313716_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Orders also increased during the year due to several multi-machine orders from consumer electronics and automotive companies in China.
313716_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Foreign currency translation on Asian and Other orders for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was a favorable impact of $1.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net sales for 2010 were $257.0 million, an increase of $42.9 million or 20% compared to 2009 net sales of $214.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in net sales for the year was mainly in Asia with $50.1 million of the increase coming from China of which $27.6 million was to a supplier to the consumer electronics industry.
313716_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Foreign currency translation on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was a favorable impact of $3.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following table presents 2010 and 2009 net sales by region:
313716_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The geographic mix of net sales as a percentage of total net sales is shown in the table below:
313716_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	North American net sales decreased by $5.9 million or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease was a result of the lagging effects of the global economic recession and was in all of our product lines with the exception of accessories, which experienced an increase in 2010 as overall manufacturing activity began to recover.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	European net sales decreased $12.9 million or 15% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease in 2010 net sales was driven by activity during the first six months of 2010 compared to the first six months of 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	The first half of 2009 benefited from sales out of machine backlog which was for orders received before the market collapse in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	Net sales in the last six months of 2010 were up $9.3 million or 24% compared to the last six months of 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S4	This increase was due to the lingering effects of the global economic recession in 2009 combined with the impact of recovery in 2010 during this period.
313716_11_ITEM7_P33_S5	Currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Asia Other net sales increased by $61.7 million or 99% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	This increase was primarily driven by strong sales in China which increased $50.1 million or 96% for the 2010 year compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Sales in China to a supplier to the consumer electronics industry contributed approximately $27.6 million in sales in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year was a favorable $2.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Under U.S. generally accepted accounting standards, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the periods presented.
313716_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	For the year ended 2010, on average the U.S. Dollar weakened 4% against the New Taiwanese Dollar, 5% against the Swiss Franc and 9% against the Canadian Dollar, while it strengthened by 3% against the Euro and by 2% against the British Pound Sterling compared to the average rates during the same period in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The U.S. Dollar remained relatively flat against the Chinese Renminbi.
313716_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	The net of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar was a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Machine sales represented approximately 75% of 2010 and 2009 net sales.
313716_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts, and accessories made up the balance.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gross profit was $61.3 million or 23.8% of net sales in 2010, compared to $40.8 million, or 19.1% of net sales in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in gross profit is attributable to the $42.9 million increase in sales volume, as well as overall improving margins in 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	The 2009 margins were negatively impacted by heavy discounts as manufacturers and distributors cut prices to reduce inventory.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	This pricing pressure carried into early 2010, but was not as prevalent.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	2009 gross profit was also negatively impacted by an inventory charge of $5.0 million related to the strategic decision to cease manufacturing non-critical parts and certain machine models in our Elmira, NY facility and $1.1 million of lower of cost or market write-downs taken on machines as a result of the 2009 market conditions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S5	Excluding these 2009 non-recurring charges, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $14.4 million or 31%, compared to the same periods in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P37_S6	Excluding the above mentioned charges, gross margin percentage for the year 2010 and 2009 would have been 23.8% and 21.9%, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense for the year 2010 was $65.7 million, or 25.5% of net sales, compared to $68.0 million, or 31.8% of net sales, in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	SG A for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes charges of $3.5 million for professional services costs related to the unsolicited tender offer, $0.6 million associated with the settlement of a tax audit in a foreign subsidiary, and $0.3 million related to Jones and Shipman acquisition costs.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	SG A for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $4.3 million primarily related to severance costs associated with the discontinuance of manufacturing non-critical parts and certain machine models in our Elmira, NY facility as well as workforce reductions in Europe.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Exclusive of these charges, SG A for 2010 and 2009 would have been $61.3 million (23.8% of sales) and $63.7 million (29.8% of sales), respectively, a year to year decrease of $2.5 million or 4%.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	The $2.5 million decrease was driven by the Company's cost control efforts, offset by increased commissions and variable selling expenses on the higher sales volume, and the impact of our Jones Shipman acquisition.
313716_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million in 2009 related to machinery and equipment.
313716_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	During 2009, as part of restructuring our North American manufacturing operations, we ceased manufacturing operations involved in the non-critical parts production in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	In conjunction with this action, we identified assets with a historical cost of $37.9 million and a net book value of $1.9 million that would no longer be used in its operations, of which, assets with a historical cost of $15.0 million and a net book value of $1.1 million were determined to have no value and disposed of resulting in a $1.1 million impairment charge.
313716_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	We also reclassified certain property, plant and equipment with a historical cost of $22.9 million and a net book value of $0.8 million as available for sale at $0.2 million and recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million during 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	This charge was determined by an analysis of current book value and the related assets fair value, if any, less costs to sell.
313716_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Loss from operations in 2010 was ($2.7) million compared to ($29.7) million in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The 2010 loss from operations included $3.5 million for professional services related to the unsolicited tender offer.
313716_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Excluding these fees, we would have had income from operations of $0.8 million, a dramatic improvement over 2009 results.
313716_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	This 2010 income from operations of $0.8 million was driven by the second half of the year which had income from operations of $4.9 million, offset by a loss from operations of $4.1 million in the first half of the year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	The loss generated during the first six months in 2010 was related to the lingering effects of the global economy, while the income during the last six months of 2010 was driven by the improving sales activity in a majority of our markets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The 2009 loss from operations can primarily be attributed to the lower net sales due to the global economic crisis.
313716_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	While the Company aggressively reacted to the severe business downturn through restructuring activities in North America and Europe, the full impact of the reduction was not eliminated.
313716_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	As a result of the 2009 restructuring activities we recorded an inventory write-down of $5.0 million resulting from discontinued production of non-critical manufacturing parts and certain machines in our Elmira, NY facility, a severance charge of $4.3 million and $1.7 million due to impairment of machinery and equipment in the Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	Additionally, during the last half of 2009, the Company, like many machine tool manufacturers, discounted the price of certain machines in order to liquidate inventory resulting in machines being sold at below costs in some cases.
313716_11_ITEM7_P41_S4	Also, as a result of the 2009 price discounting we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $1.5 million for machines remaining in inventory.
313716_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	(Gain) Loss on Sale of Assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	In 2010, we recorded proceeds of $1.6 million and a gain of $1.0 million from the sale of assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The 2009 loss on sale of assets was related to asset disposals in North America and Europe as a result of the Company's restructuring activities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Interest expense includes interest payments under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our credit facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Interest expense for the year 2010 was $0.4 million compared to $1.9 million for 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	The decrease for 2010 compared to 2009 is attributed to $1.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the termination of the multi-currency credit facility which was expensed in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	Interest income was $0.1 million in 2010 and 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Income tax expense in 2010 was $2.2 million compared to $1.8 million for 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	The effective tax rate was 70.7% in 2010 and 5.9% in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The increase in the income tax expense is the result of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, and a change in the mix of profits by country, including those countries where losses cannot be fully benefitted due to valuation allowances.
313716_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The income tax expense fundamentally represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. U.K., German, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	In 2010, the valuation allowance increased by $7.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	This was due to an increase of $6.3 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses and other deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, and an increase of $0.8 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K. (and other items recorded in Other Comprehensive Income).
313716_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	We regularly review recent results and projected future results of operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net loss for 2010 was ($5.2) million or (2.0%) of net sales, compared to ($33.3) million net loss, or (15.6%) of net sales in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Basic and diluted loss per share for 2010 were ($0.46) compared to basic and diluted loss per share of ($2.93) in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table summarizes certain financial data for year 2009 and 2008:
313716_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Orders, net of cancellations for 2009 were $175.0 million, a decrease of $166.1 million or 49% compared to 2008 orders of $341.2 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	$7.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The year over year decrease in orders, and the order cancellation activity is directly related to the global economic recession and related financial crisis which has affected all of the regions and product lines in which we conduct business, and is generally consistent with overall industry statistics.
313716_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following table presents 2009 and 2008 new orders by region:
313716_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on new orders of approximately $2.8 million for the year 2009 compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Without the currency impact, new orders for the year would have decreased $163.3 million or 48% compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	North American orders decreased $50.7 million or 49% compared to the prior year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The decline in North American orders can be attributed to the global economic recession and related financial crisis.
313716_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Decreases were noted across all of our product lines.
313716_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	European orders decreased by $106.1 million or 68% for the year 2009 compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Decreases were noted across all of our product lines and all of the countries within Europe, and as with North America, were primarily the result of the global economic recession and related financial crisis.
313716_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	The decrease over 2008 was also driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation on European orders of approximately $3.1 million for the year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Asia Other order activity decreased $9.4 million or 11% compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease was noted across all of our product lines and countries, with the exception of China.
313716_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our China market experienced an increase of $5.0 million or 8.9% for the year 2009 compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	The increase in order activity in China was attributed to two large orders totaling approximately $5.6 million from the computer, communications and consumer-electronics industry.
313716_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on Asia and Other orders for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same periods in the prior year was not material.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Net sales for 2009 were $214.1 million, a $130.9 million or a 38% decline compared to 2008 net sales of $345.0 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net sales for the year were down in all regions and countries with the exception of China, which was flat compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	On a full year basis, net sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $5.9 million related to foreign currency translation.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	Without the currency impact, sales for the year would have declined $125.0 million or 36% compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	2009 sales benefited from $96.9 million in order backlog at December 31, 2008, which was generated before the financial crisis began.
313716_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	The following table presents 2009 and 2008 sales by region:
313716_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The geographic mix of net sales as a percentage of total net sales is shown in the table below:
313716_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Machine sales represented approximately 74% of 2009 and 2008 net sales.
313716_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts, and accessories made up the balance.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Gross profit was $40.8 million or 19.1% of net sales in 2009, compared to $92.3 million, or 26.7% of net sales in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The reduction in gross profit due to the $130.9 million reduced sales volume was $35.0 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	2009 gross profit was also negatively impacted by approximately $11.9 million as a result of significantly reduced margins as we discounted machines to reduce inventory levels, sometimes below cost, as well as approximately $4.6 million related to lower capacity utilization in the U.S. and Taiwan.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	2009 gross profit was negatively impacted by a $0.5 million year over year increase in inventory write down charges.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S4	This increase in the inventory write down charge over 2008 is primarily due to the discontinuance of production of non-critical manufacturing parts and certain machines in our Elmira, NY facility, as well as lower of cost or market write-downs on machines due to competitive pressures related to the worldwide economic crisis offset by 2008 charges related to the discontinuance of certain product lines.
313716_11_ITEM7_P62_S5	The decrease over 2008 was also negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $1.5 million for the year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense for the year 2009 was $68.6 million, or 32.0% of net sales, compared to $97.8 million, or 28.3% of net sales, in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	2009 SG A expense was negatively impacted by $4.3 million related to severance expense and early retirement costs associated with the discontinuance of manufacturing non-critical parts and certain machine models in the Elmira, NY facility as well as workforce reductions in Europe.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	2008 SG A expense was negatively impacted by $2.3 million related to severance expense in the U.S. and Europe and $1.0 million related to a U.S. voluntary early retirement program.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	In addition to the severance, and early retirement costs, 2008 SG A expense included approximately $1.9 million due to foreign currency transaction losses associated with our New Taiwanese Dollar U.S. Dollar exposure.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	Severance expense for both 2009 and 2008 was a result of workforce reduction programs we implemented in all of our subsidiaries with the exception of China as a result of the global economic crisis.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S5	Excluding these costs, SG A for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $64.3 million or 30.0% of sales, a decrease of $28.3 million or 30.6% compared to the same period in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P63_S6	This decrease was driven by the impact of lower commissions and strategic actions taken by the Company to manage operating expenses as a result of the current order and sales activity levels.
313716_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	We had a favorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately $3.0 million for the year 2009, as compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1.7 million in 2009 related to machinery and equipment and $24.4 million in 2008 related to goodwill and intangible assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	In December 2009, as a result of the Company's decision to outsource non-critical components, significant sections of the Elmira manufacturing operation involved in parts production were shut down.
313716_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	In conjunction with this shut down, we identified assets with a historical cost of $37.9 million and a net book value of $1.9 million that will no longer be used in its operations, of which assets with a historical cost of $15.0 million and a net book value of $1.1 million were determined to have no value and disposed of resulting in a $1.1 million impairment charge.
313716_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	We reclassified assets with a historical cost of $22.9 million and a net book value of $0.8 million as available for sale at $0.2 million and recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million during 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	book value and the related assets fair value, if any, less costs to sell.
313716_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	In October of 2008, based on a comprehensive market evaluation, the Company determined that its model of doing business in Canada did not provide adequate returns, which triggered a review of the goodwill.
313716_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.7 million in 2008, to reflect the diminished value of goodwill of $2.1 million and $0.6 million of intangible assets associated with our Canadian operations.
313716_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Our 2008 annual impairment testing for recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets determined that all of our goodwill was impaired, thus we recorded a $21.7 million impairment charge.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Loss from operations in 2009 was ($29.7) million compared to ($29.8) million in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The 2009 loss can primarily be attributed to the $130.9 million reduction in net sales compared to 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	These decreases were primarily the result of the global economic crisis.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	While the Company aggressively reacted to this severe business downturn through restructuring activities in North America and Europe, the full impact of the reduction was not eliminated during 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	As a result of the restructuring activities we recorded an inventory write-down of $5.0 million resulting from discontinued production of non-critical manufacturing parts and certain machines in our Elmira, NY facility, a severance charge of $4.3 million and $1.7 million due to impairment of machinery and equipment in the Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S5	Additionally, during the last half of 2009, the Company, like many machine tool manufacturers, began discounting machines in order to liquidate inventory resulting in machines being sold at below costs in some cases.
313716_11_ITEM7_P68_S6	Also as a result of this discounting we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $1.5 million for machines remaining in inventory.
313716_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The 2008 loss was due to: the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $24.4 million; $7.6 million in impairment charges associated with the discontinuance of certain product lines and other expected inventory usage patterns; and $3.2 million related to severance charges associated with our restructuring activities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	(Loss) Gain on Sale of Assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The 2009 loss on sale of assets is related to asset disposals in North America and Europe as a result of the Company's restructuring activities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Interest expense includes interest payments under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our credit facility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	Interest expense for the year 2009 was $1.9 million compared to $1.7 million for 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	The increase is attributable to $1.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the termination of the multi-currency credit facility in 2009, offset by lower levels of borrowing in the current year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	Interest income was $0.1 million in 2009 compared to $0.3 million in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Income tax expense in 2009 was $1.8 million compared to $3.0 million for 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The effective tax rate was 5.9% in 2009 and 9.8% in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2008 was due primarily to the non-recurring goodwill impairment charges, which were non-deductible, resulting in a significant negative impact of 16.0% in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	Other items that negatively affected the 2009 tax rate included an increase in our valuation allowance due to not recording a tax benefit on losses in the U.S., U.K., German, Canadian, and Netherlands operations, a net increase in our liability for uncertain tax benefits due to foreign tax positions and liabilities, as well as a change in the mix of profits by country.
313716_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The income tax expense fundamentally represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	We also maintain a valuation allowance on our U.K., German, Canadian, and Dutch deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	In 2009, the valuation allowance increased by $8.4 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	This was due to an increase of $11.2 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands, a decrease of $3.3 million due to the decrease in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K. (recorded in Other Comprehensive Income), and an increase of $0.5 million due to derecognition of uncertain tax positions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We regularly review recent results and projected future results of operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net loss for 2009 was ($33.3) million or (15.6%) of net sales, compared to ($34.3) million net loss, or (9.9%) of net sales in 2008.
313716_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	Basic and diluted loss per share for 2009 were ($2.93) compared to basic and diluted loss per share of ($3.04) in 2008.

313716_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	Cash was provided by changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid and other assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Cash was used for accrued expenses which were primarily driven by decreases in customer deposits and accounts payable which decreased as a result of reduced purchasing activity driven by the economic downturn.
313716_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	The decrease in accounts receivable was due to lower sales levels during the end of 2008 and 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P83_S4	The decrease in inventory levels was due to special customer incentive programs, decreased production levels, and concentrated inventory reduction efforts.

313716_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	At our Taiwan subsidiary, Hardinge Taiwan Precision Machinery Limited, we have a mortgage loan with a bank secured by the real property owned by the Taiwan subsidiary which initially provided borrowings of 180.0 million New Taiwanese Dollars ("NTD") which was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 borrowings under this agreement were NTD 99.0 million ($3.4 million equivalent) and NTD 117.0 million ($3.7 million equivalent).
313716_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	Principal on the mortgage loan is repaid quarterly in the amount of NTD 4.5 million ($0.2 million equivalent).
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	In October 2009, Hardinge Machine Tools B.V., Taiwan Branch entered into an unsecured credit facility with a bank.
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	This agreement provided a working capital facility of NTD 100.0 million ($3.4 million equivalent).
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	This credit facility charged interest at the banks current base rate of 2.5% subject to change by the bank based on market conditions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S3	It carried no commitment fees on unused funds.
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S4	At December 31, 2009 the balance outstanding under this facility was NTD 43.6 million ($1.4 million equivalent).
313716_11_ITEM7_P107_S5	In March 2010, this credit facility was amended to change the borrowing currency from NTD to USD as well as increase the available credit under the facility to $5.0 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	In July 2010, the Hardinge Machine Tools B.V., Taiwan Branch credit facility was replaced with a new agreement that provides a $10.0 million multi-currency facility for working capital purposes.
313716_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	The credit facility charges interest at the bank's current base rate of 1.6% subject to change by the bank based on market conditions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	This new credit facility matures on May 31, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	It carries no commitment fees on unused funds.
313716_11_ITEM7_P108_S4	At December 31, 2010 the balance outstanding under this facility was $1.7 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	We maintain a standby letter of credit for potential liabilities pertaining to self-insured workers compensation exposure.
313716_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	The amount of the letter of credit was $1.3 million at December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	It expires on March 15, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	In total, we had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.0 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Under our current credit facilities, the Company has total credit availability of up to $50.5 million at December 31, 2010 of which $34.8 million is available for working capital needs.
313716_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	$31.4 million was available under these facilities at December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Total consolidated outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $5.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	Interest expense in 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $0.4 million, $1.9 million, and $1.7 million, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	We conduct some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations from leased space, with lease terms up to 10 years, and use office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $2.1 million, $1.9 million, and $2.5 million, during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following table shows our future commitments in effect as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
313716_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	In 2011, we anticipate making $4.3 million contributions to our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans and $0.5 million contributions to our domestic post-retirement plan.
313716_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	We believe that the currently available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2011.
313716_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The following information has been provided in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's requirements for disclosure of exposures to market risk arising from certain market risk sensitive instruments.
313716_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our floating interest rate debt.
313716_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	If market interest rates on debt subject to floating interest rates were to have increased by 2% over the actual rates paid in that year, interest expense would have increased by $0.1 million in 2010 and $0.3 million in 2009.
313716_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's borrowing cost.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	We currently manufacture our products in Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States, China, and United Kingdom using production components purchased internationally, and we sell our products in those markets as well as other worldwide markets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	Our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada sell products in local currency to customers in those countries.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	These subsidiaries also transact business in currencies other than their functional currency outside of their home country.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S4	Our Taiwanese subsidiary sells products to foreign purchasers in U.S. dollars.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S5	As a result of these sales in various currencies and in various countries of the world, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S6	Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Euro, New Taiwanese Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S7	As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we are exposed to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on our cash flows, earnings and balance sheet.
313716_11_ITEM7_P118_S8	To mitigate this currency risk we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non-functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year.
313716_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies, which were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	We assess the collectibility of our trade accounts and notes receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	On a case by case basis, we offer long-term customer financing in the form of notes receivable at some of our foreign operations.
313716_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of uncollectibility.
313716_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Changes in metal-cutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_11_ITEM7_P125_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the company.
313716_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, including some which are no longer in production.
313716_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	We have acquired other machine tool companies or assets of companies.
313716_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	When doing so, we have used outside specialists to assist in determining the value of assets acquired, and have used traditional models for establishing purchase price based on EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples and present value of future cash flows.
313716_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	Consequently, the value of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet have been affected by the use of numerous estimates of the value of assets purchased and of future business opportunity.
313716_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities, using bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using a rate of 5.93% and 6.27% at our plan measurement date of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in a blended rate of 3.09% and 3.84% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $12.2 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	An increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $10.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P133_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Kellenberger pension obligations by approximately $11.9 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P133_S4	An increase of one percent would decrease the Kellenberger pension obligations by approximately $9.3 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	An increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.05 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P134_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Kellenberger pension expense by approximately $1.2 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P134_S4	An increase of one percent would decrease the Kellenberger pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_11_ITEM7_P135_S3	We used an expected rate of return of 8.00% and 8.00% at our measurement dates of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for our domestic plan.
313716_11_ITEM7_P135_S4	We used rates of return appropriate for each country for our foreign plans which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 4.23% and 5.14% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P136_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Kellenberger pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P136_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Kellenberger pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
313716_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition ASC Topic 605: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13).
313716_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	ASU 2009-13 addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit.
313716_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	Specifically, this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is necessary to separately account for each product or service.
313716_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	This hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance.
313716_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	ASU 2009-13 is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
313716_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	The amendment requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.
313716_11_ITEM7_P139_S2	Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).
313716_11_ITEM7_P139_S3	We have applied the new disclosure requirements as of January 1, 2010, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM7_P139_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company's ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company's entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company's ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors' actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_11_ITEM7_P141_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Market Risk" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, of this Form 10-K.
313716_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts is included in Item 15(a) of this report.
313716_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not required under the related instructions or are inapplicable and, therefore, have been omitted.
313716_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
313716_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Hardinge Inc. (the "Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures and other industrial products.
313716_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	A substantial portion of our sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying amounts due to the short maturities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Occasionally, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits or foreign exchange forward contracts.
313716_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of restricted cash was approximately $5.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	We perform periodic credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base.
313716_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	trade accounts receivable to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
313716_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.4 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	In the past, we provided long-term financing for the purchase of our equipment by qualified end-user customers in North America, with the Company retaining a security interest in the purchased equipment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	We also have notes receivable in our Asian subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	These notes are fully guaranteed by local financial institutions and are generally for periods of less than one year.
313716_11_ITEM8_P22_S3	The amount of notes receivable outstanding was $1.8 million and $2.5 million at December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P22_S4	These amounts are net of bad debt allowances of $1.6 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	In the event of a customer default and foreclosure, it is our practice to recondition and resell the equipment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	It has been our experience that such equipment resales have realized most, but not all, of the remaining contract value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on notes.
313716_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Depreciation expense is computed on the straight-line and accelerated methods over the assets' estimated useful lives.
313716_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	The depreciable lives of our fixed assets vary according to their estimated useful lives and generally are: 40 years for buildings, 12 years for machinery, and 10 years for patterns, tools, jigs, and furniture and fixtures, and 5 years for office and computer equipment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	Depreciation expense was $5.7 million, $7.2 million, and $8.1 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill and other separately recognized intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment or are reviewed for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment, if indicators of impairment are identified.
313716_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, we use undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	We account for income taxes using the liability method where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	These deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
313716_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
313716_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a company's current and past performance, the market conditions in which the company operates, the utilization of past tax credits, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, sales backlogs, etc. that will result in future profits.
313716_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P32_S3	Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment and were a major consideration in our decision to establish a valuation allowance.
313716_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	We also maintain a valuation allowance on our U.K., German, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China and Taiwan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	Accordingly, these substantial judgment items impacted the effective tax rate for 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740.
313716_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Interest and penalties are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives, and returns.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return machines.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S4	In the rare case that a machine return is permitted, a restocking fee is typically charged.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders which are not eligible for return.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_11_ITEM8_P36_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
313716_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Prior to shipment, each machine is tested to ensure the machine's compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our promotional literature.
313716_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	On an exception basis, where larger multiple machine installations are delivered which require run-offs and customer acceptance at their facility, revenue is recognized in the period of customer acceptance.
313716_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Revenue from extended warranties are deferred and recognized on a pro-rata basis across the term of the warranty contract.
313716_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	We collect and remit taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the Company and its customers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	These taxes may include sales, use, and value-added taxes.
313716_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
313716_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Shipping and handling cost are recorded as part of cost of goods sold.
313716_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	We offer warranties for our products.
313716_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we sold the product.
313716_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	We generally provide a basic limited warranty for a period of one year.
313716_11_ITEM8_P41_S3	We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair cost history, and record a liability for such costs in the month that product revenue is recognized.
313716_11_ITEM8_P41_S4	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
313716_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
313716_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	We also sell extended warranties for some of our products.
313716_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	These extended warranties usually cover a 12-24 month period that begins up to 12 months after time of sale.
313716_11_ITEM8_P43_S2	Revenues for these extended warranties are recognized monthly as a portion of the warranty expires.
313716_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	These liabilities are reported in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet.
313716_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	A reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty accrual during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	The costs associated with research and development programs for new products and significant product improvements are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of goods sold.
313716_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Research and development expenses totaled $9.4 million, $9.3 million, and $9.8 million, in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
313716_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Net assets are translated at month end exchange rates while income, expense, and cash flow items are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period.
313716_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	Translation adjustments are recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss).
313716_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, long-term debt and foreign currency forwards.
313716_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The carrying values for our financial instruments approximate fair value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	See Note 9 for additional disclosure.
313716_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	As a multinational Company, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	To manage this risk, we enter into derivative instruments namely in the form of foreign currency forwards.
313716_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	Our derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on balance sheet exposures of both trade and intercompany assets and liabilities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	We hedge this exposure with contracts settling in less than a year.
313716_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are recognized in earnings.
313716_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	We have some forward contracts to hedge vendor firm commitments.
313716_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	These contracts which are for less than two years have maturity dates in alignment with our contractual payment requirements.
313716_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as cash flow hedges.
313716_11_ITEM8_P51_S3	Unrealized gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are charged to Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
313716_11_ITEM8_P51_S4	Gains or losses on any ineffective portion of the contracts will be recognized in earnings.
313716_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	We account for stock-based compensation based on the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and recognize as expense the value of the award over the required service period.
313716_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Comprehensive income consists of net income, postretirement plan adjustments, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on hedging, net of tax, and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.
313716_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
313716_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Net (loss) income available to common shareholders represents net (loss) income reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	Losses are not allocated to participating securities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options.
313716_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the earnings allocation in the earnings per share calculation under the two-class method.
313716_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period, therefore, meeting the definition of a participating security.
313716_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Net inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and are as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.
313716_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	We also review the carrying value of our inventory compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying value accordingly.
313716_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	If future demand for our products is less favorable than our forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	During 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $8.1 million for the impairment of inventory.
313716_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	$5.0 million of this charge resulted from the discontinued production of non-critical manufacturing parts and certain machines in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	$1.5 million of this charge was related to lower of cost or market write-downs on machines reflecting the current competitive market conditions and $1.6 million was related to excess and obsolescence reserve requirements.
313716_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	During 2008, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our operations, products, and worldwide markets.
313716_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	As a result of this strategic review, we decided to focus on products which were in the higher end of the product spectrum.
313716_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	As a result of this change, we discontinued certain product lines which targeted less demanding manufacturing applications.
313716_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	Additionally, due to the actions taken to reposition our product mix, as well as a review of other expected inventory usage patterns, we recognized a non-cash charge as a component of cost of sales of approximately $7.6 million in 2008 for the impairment of inventory.
313716_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Components of property, plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following:
313716_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	During 2009, as part of restructuring our North American manufacturing operations, we ceased manufacturing operations involved in the non-critical parts production in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	In conjunction with this action, we identified certain property, plant and equipment with an acquisition cost of $22.9 million and net book value of $0.8 million that would no longer be utilized in our manufacturing operations and made them available for sale.
313716_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	These assets were recorded on the balance sheet at $0.2 million as of December 31, 2009 based on the lower of the assets' carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell, with a related impairment charge of $0.6 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	In addition to the assets that were classified as available for sale, we identified certain property, plant and equipment with an acquisition cost of $15.0 million and a net book value of $1.1 million that would no longer be utilized in our manufacturing operations and disposed of them.
313716_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2009 we recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million related to these assets.
313716_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	During 2010, we changed our plan to sell some of these assets that had been identified in December 2009.
313716_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	The assets reclassified to "held and used" had an original acquisition cost of $4.7 million and a net book value of $0.05 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	Upon returning these assets to "held and used," we measured them at the lower of their (a) carrying amount before they were classified as "held for sale," adjusted by any depreciation expense or impairment losses that would have been recognized had the assets continuously been classified as "held for sale" or (b) fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell, which resulted in a recovery of $0.03 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	During 2010, we recognized a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets primarily related to the sale of the excess machinery and equipment at the Elmira, NY manufacturing facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Goodwill and other separately recognized intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather reviewed at least annually for impairment or reviewed for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment if indicators for impairment are identified.
313716_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we do not have any amounts recorded as goodwill on our balance sheet.
313716_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The major components of intangible assets are as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Nonamortizable intangible assets include $7.5 million representing the value of the name, trademarks and copyrights associated with the former worldwide operations of Bridgeport.
313716_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	We use the Bridgeport brand name on all of our machining center lines; therefore, the asset has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.
313716_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The $0.7 million increase in this nonamortizable intangible asset in 2010 was the impact of foreign currency exchange.
313716_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Amortizable intangible assets include $3.5 million for the Bridgeport technical information, Jones Shipman trade name, customer lists, patents and other items.
313716_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	In late 2010, we acquired land use rights in China and recorded an intangible asset of $2.6 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	Amortization of these intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $0.8 million and $0.7 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P72_S3	The estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets for each of the next five years is approximately $0.8 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P72_S4	The estimated remaining weighted average useful life of these intangible assets is 11.7 years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Maturities of long-term debt under the long-term financing agreements in place are as follows for the years ended December 31, (in thousands):
313716_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	In June 2008, we entered into a five-year $100.0 million multi-currency secured credit facility ("Credit Facility").
313716_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The Credit Facility was secured by substantially all of the Company's and its domestic subsidiaries' assets, other than real estate, and a pledge of (i) 100% of the Company's investments in its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) 66 2 / 3 % of the Company's investment in Hardinge Holdings GmbH, the parent corporation of our significant foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	In addition, if certain conditions were met, Hardinge Holdings GmbH may have been required to pledge its investment in certain of its material foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	The obligations of the Company and Hardinge Holdings GmbH were also guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and, under certain conditions, by certain of the Company's material foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Interest was based on London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR"') plus a spread which varied depending on the Company's debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio.
313716_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	A variable commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.375%, based on the Company's debt to EBITDA ratio, was payable on the unused portion of the Credit Facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	In March 2009, after using cash on hand generated from operating results to reduce the outstanding obligations under our $100.0 million multi-currency secured credit facility to $8.0 million, the facility was terminated.
313716_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	We recorded a non-cash charge of $1.0 million in 2009 related to the unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with this termination.
313716_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	In March 2009, we entered into an agreement with a bank for a 366 day $10.0 million term loan due on March 16, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	This term loan replaced the $100.0 million multi-currency secured credit facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	The term loan was secured by substantially all of the Company's U.S. assets (exclusive of real property), a negative pledge on the Company's headquarters in Elmira, NY and a pledge of 66 2 / 3 % of the Company's investment in Hardinge Holdings GmbH. Interest was based on one-month ("LIBOR") plus 5.0%.
313716_11_ITEM8_P77_S3	The interest rate increased by 1.0% to LIBOR plus 6.0% on September 30, 2009, with a minimum interest rate of 5.5% at all times.
313716_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	In December 2009, we replaced the $10.0 million term loan due March 16, 2010 with a $10.0 million revolving credit facility due March 31, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	This new credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's U. S. assets (exclusive of real property), a negative pledge on the Company's headquarters in Elmira, NY and a pledge of 65% of the Company's investment in Hardinge Holdings GmbH.

313716_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	In 2010, the valuation allowance increased by $7.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	This was due to an increase of $6.3 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses and other deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, and an increase of $0.8 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K., (and other items recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)).
313716_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	In 2009, the valuation allowance increased by $8.4 million.

313716_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	At the end of 2010, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to approximately $115.5 million, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state taxes has been provided thereon.
313716_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	We had been granted a tax holiday in China which expires in 2011.
313716_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	For 2010, our tax rate for our Chinese subsidiary was 22%, and our tax rate in China will be 24% in 2011 and 25% in 2012.

313716_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	Domestic and foreign operations consist of:

313716_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	We provide a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all eligible domestic employees hired before March 1, 2004.
313716_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	The plan based benefits upon both years of service and earnings.
313716_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Our policy is to fund at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA.
313716_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	For our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are governed by their governmental regulations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P115_S2	Each foreign plan requires employee and employer contributions except Hardinge Taiwan, which requires only employer contributions.
313716_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	Effective June 15, 2009, we suspended benefit accruals under the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (which was closed to new participants in 2004).
313716_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	In November and September of 2010, we permanently froze the accrual of benefits under the domestic and one of our foreign defined benefit pension plans.
313716_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Domestic employees hired on or after March 1, 2004 have retirement benefits under our 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	will further match 25% of the first 4% that the employee contributes.
313716_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	As of June 15, 2009, we suspended the 25% company match as well as the 4% company contribution to the 401(k) plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	For 2009, employees were credited with a pro-rata portion of the 4% company contribution which was paid in January 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P118_S3	We made contributions of $0.1 million and $0.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P118_S4	In November 2010 and effective January 1, 2011, we rescinded the suspension of company contributions to the plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	In conjunction with the permanent freeze of benefit accruals under the domestic defined benefit plan, employees that were actively participating in the domestic defined benefit plan became eligible to receive company contributions in the 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P119_S1	Additionally, upon reaching age 50, employees who are age 40 or older as of January 1, 2011 are also provided enhanced employer contributions in the 401(k) defined contribution plan to compensate for the loss of future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P119_S2	Employees may contribute additional funds to the plan for which there is no required company match.
313716_11_ITEM8_P119_S3	All employer and employee contributions are invested at the direction of the employees in a number of investment alternatives, one being Hardinge Inc. common stock.
313716_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	As a result of the permanent freeze to the accrual of benefits under the domestic and one of our foreign defined benefit pension plans, we realized a net curtailment gain of $0.3 million in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	As a result of our 2009 restructuring activities in North America and Europe, we realized a reduction in the number of participants in our defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans.
313716_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized settlement and curtailment losses of $0.6 million in our defined benefit pension plans and a curtailment gain of $0.6 million in our other post-retirement benefits plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	We provide a contributory retiree health plan covering all eligible domestic employees who retired at normal retirement age prior to January 1, 1993 and all retirees who have or will retire at normal retirement age after January 1, 1993 with at least 10 years of active service.
313716_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	Employees who elect early retirement on or after reaching age 55 are eligible for the plan benefits if they have 15 years of active service at retirement.
313716_11_ITEM8_P121_S2	Benefit obligations and funding policies are at the discretion of management.
313716_11_ITEM8_P121_S3	We also provide a non-contributory life insurance plan to retirees who meet the same eligibility criteria as required for retiree health insurance.
313716_11_ITEM8_P121_S4	Because the amount of liability relative to this plan is insignificant, it is combined with the health plan for purposes of this disclosure.
313716_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	In 2009 and 2008, we offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP") to eligible employees.
313716_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	Employees were eligible to participate in the VERP if the sum of their current age and length of service equaled 94 years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P122_S2	The VERP covers post-retirement health care costs for 60 months or until Medicare coverage begins, whichever occurs first.
313716_11_ITEM8_P122_S3	We have recognized $1.1 million in costs for the 2009 and 2008 VERP, of which $0.6 million and $0.8 million are included within the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	Increases in the cost of the retiree health plan are paid by the participants with the exception of premium costs for eligible employees who retired under a VERP.
313716_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	For each VERP retiree, we pay the premium in excess of a scheduled amount until they reach Medicare eligibility or for a period not to exceed five years at which point the retiree assumes responsibility for any premium increases.
313716_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	The discount rate for determining benefit obligations in the postretirement benefits plan was 5.50% and 5.80% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	The change in the discount rate increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by $0.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost and postretirement benefit costs for the consolidated Company is presented below.
313716_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	The pension cost includes an executive supplemental pension plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	The net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above was $1.7 million, $2.8 million, and $0.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	A summary of the changes in pension and postretirement benefits recognized in Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss is presented below.
313716_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	We expect to recognize $1.7 million of net loss, $0.3 million credit of transition asset obligation and $0.1 million of net prior service cost credit as components of net periodic pension cost in 2011 for our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	We expect to recognize $0.4 million of net prior service credit as components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2011.
313716_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	A summary of the Pension and Postretirement Plans' funded status and amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets is as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	The projected benefit obligations for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above were $92.2 million and $79.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	The plan assets for the foreign pension plans included above were $84.2 million and $75.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	The accumulated benefit obligations were $185.0 million and $165.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except one plan in Switzerland in 2010 and 2009):
313716_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except Taiwan and one plan in Switzerland in 2010 and all plans except Taiwan and two plans in Switzerland in 2009):
313716_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include:
313716_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension obligations and other postretirement obligations include:
313716_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans, discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and foreign plans, we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	For the domestic defined benefit plan, the plan targets an asset allocation of approximately 55% equity securities, 36% debt securities, and 9% other.
313716_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	For the foreign defined benefit plans, the plans target blended asset allocation of 41% equity securities, 45% debt securities, and 14% other.
313716_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	Given the relatively long horizon of our aggregate obligation, our investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of our domestic and foreign plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	We manage this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P140_S2	In addition, we ensure that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	Our domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.
313716_11_ITEM8_P141_S1	The selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of management, investment committees, plan trustees, and their advisors.
313716_11_ITEM8_P141_S2	The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written investment management agreements and related policy guidelines and applicable governmental regulations regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.
313716_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding.
313716_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	Of our defined benefit plans, the U.S. plan covering the parent company is the largest.
313716_11_ITEM8_P142_S2	The contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plan for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $0.5 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The expected contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2011 to the domestic defined benefit plan are approximately $1.8 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P143_S1	We also provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans for our foreign subsidiaries.
313716_11_ITEM8_P143_S2	The expected contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2011 to the foreign defined benefit plans are $2.3 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P143_S3	For each of our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are determined by their governmental regulations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P143_S4	Also, each of the foreign plans requires employee and employer contributions, except for Taiwan, which has only employer contributions.
313716_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
313716_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	Hardinge also has employees in certain foreign countries that are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and other employee benefit plans.
313716_11_ITEM8_P145_S1	Related obligations and costs charged to operations for these are not material.
313716_11_ITEM8_P145_S2	The foreign entities with defined benefit plans are included in the consolidated pension plan described earlier within this Employee Benefits Note.
313716_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
313716_11_ITEM8_P146_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P146_S2	We are using the following fair value hierarchy definition:
313716_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P147_S2	Level 3 Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following table presents the fair values and classification of our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010:
313716_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The following table presents the fair values and classification of our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009:
313716_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	Our derivative assets and liabilities are foreign exchange derivatives that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_11_ITEM8_P150_S1	Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
313716_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments to be active.
313716_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2.
313716_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of notes receivable approximated their fair value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	The fair value of our variable interest rate debt is approximately equal to its carrying value, as the underlying interest rate is variable.
313716_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	During 2010 and 2009, we did not have any significant non-recurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities other than the impairment related to machinery and equipment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following table presents the fair values and classification of our defined benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2010:
313716_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following table presents the fair values and classification of our defined benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2009:
313716_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	(1) Growth funds represent a type of fund containing a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities with a goal of capital appreciation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	(2) Income funds represent a type of fund with an emphasis on current income as opposed to capital appreciation.
313716_11_ITEM8_P157_S2	Such funds may contain a variety of domestic and international government and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments, and dividend-paying stocks.
313716_11_ITEM8_P157_S3	(3) Growth and Income funds represent a type of fund containing a combination of growth and income securities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P157_S4	(4) Hedge funds represent a managed portfolio of investments that use advanced investment strategies such as leveraged, long, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.
313716_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	advanced notification requirements, as well as the right to delay redemption until sufficient fund liquidity exists.
313716_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	The table below sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
313716_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	Most of our defined benefit pension plan Level 1 assets are debt and equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally.
313716_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	They are measured at fair value using closing prices from active markets.
313716_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Level 2 assets are typically investments in pooled funds, which are measured based on the value of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
313716_11_ITEM8_P161_S1	The fair value of our Level 3 plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
313716_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	We principally use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.
313716_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	We enter into derivative financial instruments with a number of major financial institutions to minimize foreign exchange risk.
313716_11_ITEM8_P162_S2	These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	We have foreign currency exposure on receivables and payables that are denominated in a foreign currency and are adjusted to current values using period-end exchange rates.
313716_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	The resulting gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	To minimize foreign currency exposure, we have foreign currency forwards with notional amounts of approximately $22.3 million and $12.4 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	Generally, our foreign currency forwards are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and resulting gains or losses are recorded in the statements of operations, generally offsetting the gains or losses from the revaluation of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	At December 31, 2010, the fair value of the foreign currency forwards was a $0.3 million asset, which was included in prepaid expenses and a $0.1 million liability which was included in accrued expenses.
313716_11_ITEM8_P165_S2	At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the foreign currency forwards was a $0.06 million asset, which was included in prepaid expenses and a $0.03 million liability which was included in accrued expenses.
313716_11_ITEM8_P165_S3	The (gain) loss recognized for derivative instruments in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was ($1.4) million and $0.6 million, respectively, and was included in other (income) expense.
313716_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	We also enter into forward contracts to hedge vendor firm commitments.
313716_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	These derivatives are treated as cash flow hedges.
313716_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	Gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are charged to Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss.
313716_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	Gains or losses on any ineffective portion of the contracts will be recognized in earnings.
313716_11_ITEM8_P167_S3	There was no impact on earnings in 2010 related to these contracts.
313716_11_ITEM8_P167_S4	The unrealized (gain) loss recognized for derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment in Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.1 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits as a result of normal operations and in the ordinary course of business.
313716_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	Management believes the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	On October 28, 2008, a putative class-action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York against the Company and certain former officers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	This complaint, as amended, alleged that during the period from January 16, 2007 to February 21, 2008 the defendants made misleading statements and/or omissions relating to our business and operating results in violation of the Federal securities laws.
313716_11_ITEM8_P169_S2	On May 29, 2009, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
313716_11_ITEM8_P169_S3	By a decision and order dated February 2, 2010, the Court dismissed the class action lawsuit.
313716_11_ITEM8_P169_S4	The plaintiff did not file a notice to appeal the Court's dismissal of the lawsuit and the time to appeal expired.
313716_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	Activities at properties we own or previously owned and on adjacent areas have resulted in environmental impacts.
313716_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	In particular, our Elmira, New York manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, New York.
313716_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM8_P175_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	Hardinge, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation, and Toshiba America, Inc., the Potentially Responsible Parties (the PRPs") have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	The cost of the RI/FS was estimated to be approximately $0.84 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	We estimate our portion of the study to be $0.12 million for which we have established a reserve of $0.13 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P178_S3	As of December 31, 2010 we have incurred total expenses of $0.12 million with respect to the study and other activities relating to the Site.
313716_11_ITEM8_P178_S4	The remaining reserve balance at December 31, 2010 is $0.01 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	The PRPs developed a Draft RI/FS with their consultants and, following EPA comments, submitted a Revised RI/FS on December 6, 2007.
313716_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_11_ITEM8_P179_S2	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and submitted a Draft Site Characterization Report to EPA in the fall.
313716_11_ITEM8_P179_S3	The PRPs currently are performing Risk Assessments in accordance with the Remedial Investigation portion of the RI/FS.
313716_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice, Hardinge had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had we received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the site.
313716_11_ITEM8_P180_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond and found no evidence that our operations or property have or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_11_ITEM8_P180_S2	Other than as described above, we have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_11_ITEM8_P180_S3	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available that except as described in the preceding paragraphs we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to Hardinge.
313716_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 10 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_11_ITEM8_P182_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $2.1 million, $1.9 million, and $2.5 million, during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows for the years ending December 31 (in thousands):
313716_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company has entered into written employment contracts with its executive officers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P184_S1	The currently effective term of the employment agreements is two years and the agreements contain an automatic, successive one-year extension unless either party provides the other with 60 days prior notice of termination.
313716_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	each officer's employment will be automatically extended for a period of two years following the date of the change in control.
313716_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	These employment contracts also provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment, the amount of which is increased upon certain termination events following a change in control.
313716_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	During 2008 and 2009, the Company offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) to employees whose sum of current age and length of service equaled 94.
313716_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	The VERP covers post-retirement health care costs for 60 months or until Medicare coverage begins, whichever occurs first.
313716_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company also incurred various restructuring related charges in 2009 due to workforce reductions in Europe, the closure of our Exeter England facility, and the reduction in our U.S. workforce due the strategic changes within the Elmira, NY manufacturing facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	Total severance related charges on these items in 2009 were $4.3 million.
313716_11_ITEM8_P187_S2	There was no additional charge in 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P187_S3	These charges were recorded in SG A in our Statement of Operations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Hardinge has 20,000,000 common shares of stock authorized and 12,472,992 shares issued.
313716_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	On December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we had 11,607,289, 11,533,752 and 11,469,164 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.
313716_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	The number of shares of common stock in treasury was as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	In 2008, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $10.0 million of our common stock to be purchased through February 28, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	The Company repurchased 45,500 shares of our common stock at an average price of $12.72 through this program during 2008.
313716_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	In February 2010, the Company adopted a one-year Shareholders Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock.
313716_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	The Rights are designed to ensure that all stockholders of Hardinge receive fair and equal treatment in the case of a takeover bid and to enable our stockholders to realize the full long-term value of their investment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P191_S2	No Rights were exercised under the Shareholder Rights Plan, which expired on March 1, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.
313716_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
313716_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	Net (loss) income applicable to common shareholders represents net (loss) income reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P193_S2	Losses are not allocated to participating securities.
313716_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options.
313716_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	The computation of earnings per share is as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	There is no dilutive effect of the restrictive stock and stock options for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 since the impact would be anti-dilutive.
313716_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	150,262, 54,933, and 69,167 shares would have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculations for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, had the impact of including these diluted securities not been anti-dilutive.
313716_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	All restricted shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transfer.
313716_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	Unconditional vesting occurs upon the completion of a specified period ranging from three to eight years from the date of grant.
313716_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	Stock options vest over a three year period and are exercisable over ten years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	We have an Incentive Stock Plan which allows the Board of Directors to issue restricted stock, performance share awards, stock options, and stock appreciation rights.
313716_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	Under the 2002 Plan, an aggregate of 450,000 shares of common stock can be awarded.
313716_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense in relation to restricted stock awards.

313716_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	This deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the specified service period, which ranges from three to eight years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P203_S2	The unamortized deferred compensation at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $0.8 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and is included in additional paid in capital as a reduction of shareholders' equity.
313716_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	We use shares of stock held in treasury to fulfill restricted stock awards or shares earned from the exercise of stock options.

313716_11_ITEM8_P211_S4	The acquisition provided Hardinge with valuable product lines, as well as the addition of the strong Jones Shipman brand name to our grinding portfolio.
313716_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	The acquisition agreement contains provisions for a contingent purchase price payment based on sales through March 31, 2014.
313716_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	The contingent purchase price payment is 5.42% of sales in excess of 36.4 million (approximately $54.5 million), with a maximum payment of 0.3 million (approximately $0.45 million).
313716_11_ITEM8_P212_S2	Based on the Company's forecasted revenue over this period, the fair value of this contingent purchase price was 0.2 (approximately $0.3 million) as of April 7, 2010 and December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P212_S3	This contingent liability is recorded on the balance sheet within accrued expenses.
313716_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2010:
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S1	Acquired inventory is valued based on one of the following methods: for acquired finished goods inventory, the value is based on the expected sales price less an allowance for direct selling costs and profits thereon; for acquired work in process the value is based on the expected sales price less an allowance for costs to complete the manufacturing process, direct selling costs and profits thereon; and for acquired raw materials, the value is based on the current market price.
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S2	Acquired property, plant and equipment are valued based upon our estimate of replacement cost less an allowance for age and condition at the time of acquisition.
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S3	The weighted average life of these intangible assets is 6.6 years.
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S4	Other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities are expected to be settled at face value; therefore face value is assumed to approximate fair value.
313716_11_ITEM8_P214_S5	The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price; accordingly, a gain of 0.4 million (approximately $0.6 million) was recorded in 2010 within other expense (income) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	Unsolicited Tender Offer by Industrias Romi S.A.
313716_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	On March 30, 2010, Industrias Romi S.A. ("Romi"), through a wholly-owned subsidiary, commenced an unsolicited tender offer to acquire the outstanding Common Shares of Stock of Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or the "Company") for $8.00 per share, subject to a number of terms and conditions contained in the tender offer documents filed by Romi with the SEC ("Romi's Offer").
313716_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	On May 10, 2010, Romi increased their offer to $10.00 per share ("Romi's Amended Offer").
313716_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	After multiple extensions, on July 15, 2010 Romi announced the expiration of their tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hardinge and did not further extend the offer.
313716_11_ITEM8_P216_S3	No shares of Hardinge stock were purchased pursuant to the offer, and Romi indicated that all shares of Hardinge previously tendered and not withdrawn were returned.
313716_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	As noted in the Company's Schedule 14D-9 filings with the SEC, our Board unanimously determined that Romi's Offer and Romi's Amended Offer were not in the best interests of the Company and the Company's shareholders and recommended that Company shareholders reject Romi's Offer and not tender their shares.
313716_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	The Schedule 14D-9 and the amendments thereto include a complete discussion of the reasons and other material factors contributing to the Board of Director's recommendations.
313716_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	The Company recorded expense of $3.5 million in 2010 within Selling, General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to this unsolicited tender offer.
313716_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	Summarized quarterly financial information for 2010 and 2009 is as follows:
313716_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	2009 results include a non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million associated with certain machinery and equipment formerly utilized in the manufacture of non-critical parts in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	We adopted the provisions of ASC 260 on January 1, 2009, which establishes that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
313716_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the annual earnings per share for the year.
313716_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition ASC Topic 605: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13).
313716_11_ITEM8_P223_S1	ASU 2009-13 addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit.
313716_11_ITEM8_P223_S2	Specifically, this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is necessary to separately account for each product or service.
313716_11_ITEM8_P223_S3	This hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance.
313716_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	ASU 2009-13 is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P224_S1	We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
313716_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	The amendment requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.
313716_11_ITEM8_P225_S2	Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).
313716_11_ITEM8_P225_S3	We have applied the new disclosure requirements as of January 1, 2010, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM8_P225_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
313716_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	In February 2010, the Company adopted a one-year Shareholders Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock.
313716_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	The Rights are designed to ensure that all stockholders of Hardinge receive fair and equal treatment in the case of a takeover bid and to enable our stockholders to realize the full long-term value of their investment.
313716_11_ITEM8_P226_S2	No rights were exercised under the Shareholder Rights Plan, which expired on March 1, 2011.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness as of December 31, 2010 of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based upon this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Hardinge Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
313716_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
313716_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that it maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
313716_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.
313716_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based upon this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Hardinge Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
313716_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
313716_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that it maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
313716_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
313716_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 14, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	We are a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of machine tools, specializing in precision computer numerically controlled metal-cutting machines.
313716_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company has the following direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries:
313716_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metal-cutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and accessories related to those machines.
313716_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	The grinding machines of Kellenberger, which are manufactured in both computer and manually controlled models, are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser and Tschudin grinding brands.
313716_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2010, the Company established Jones Shipman Grinding Limited.
313716_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	after acquiring the assets of Jones and Shipman, a UK-based manufacturer of grinding and super-abrasive machines and machining systems.
313716_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Jones Shipman manufactures and distributes a range of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed and cylindrical) machines used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Products are introduced each year to both broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace previous models nearing the end of their life cycles.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes and which also may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	On many of our machines, multiple options are available which allow customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Certain parts on machines wear over time or break through misuse.
313716_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which is generally measured in multiple years.
313716_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	In addition, we offer an extensive line of accessories including workholding, toolholding, and other industrial support products, which may be used on both our machines and those produced by others.
313716_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, Netherlands, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_12_ITEM1_P21_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our non-machine products are sold in the U.S. mainly through direct telephone orders to a toll-free telephone number and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products through publication of general catalogues and other targeted catalogues, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	We have a substantial presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for workholding, rotary, and knee mill products.
313716_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2011, no single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 10% our consolidated sales.
313716_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	In 2010, a customer who is a supplier to the consumer electronics industry accounted for 10.7% of our consolidated sales.
313716_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Hardinge Inc. operates in a single business segment, industrial machine tools.
313716_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We compete in the various segments of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding and workholding.
313716_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	We compete with numerous vendors in each market segment we serve.
313716_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level they can achieve.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as Mori-Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma, which are based in Japan, and DMG, which is based in Germany.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes to some degree from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss Company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S4	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_12_ITEM1_P31_S5	Our accessories products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our market segments may increase.
313716_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Also, the composition of competitors may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	As we expand into new market segments, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Kellenberger grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	machining centers and lathes at our facilities in Hardinge Taiwan in Nan Tou, Taiwan, Hardinge Machine (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, China, and Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Co., Ltd. in Jiaxing, China.
313716_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption, however, with the recent increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting demand.
313716_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	We purchase these components for our lathes and machining centers primarily from Fanuc Limited, a large Japanese electronics company and Heidenhain, a German control supplier.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	We also utilize controls from Siemens, another German control manufacturer, on certain machine models in our line of machining centers.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	On our grinding machines we offer Heidenhain and Fanuc controls.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S4	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S5	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_12_ITEM1_P36_S6	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $12.2 million, $9.4 million and $9.3 million, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	Given that a larger percentage of our sales are now from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the Lunar New Year may impact first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines are typically from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to ocean travel times, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	In those cases the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available workholding and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the multiple countries in which we conduct business.
313716_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to certain property we own and on adjacent areas.
313716_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc. (the Potentially Responsible Parties or "PRPs") has agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and on September 7, 2011 submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	The PRPs are continuing to address EPA comments and to perform the tasks required by the RI/FS Work Plan and Administrative Settlement Agreement.
313716_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and had found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	We have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Hardinge Inc. employed 1,332 persons, 409 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
313716_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	Management believes that relations with Hardinge's employees are good.
313716_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A Risk Factors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge Inc. could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by the current global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Many of our customers finance their purchases of our products through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or from the proceeds received in connection with an issuance of equity.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The recent world-wide financial crisis and related impact on the global financial market generated significant losses due to failures of many dominant financial institutions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The governments of the United States and several foreign countries instituted bailout plans to assist many banks and others impacted by the economic crisis.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This crisis has resulted in, among other things, a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit, the impact of which is still being experienced today in some of our markets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Additionally, many of our customers' equity values have substantially declined.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The combination of a reduction in borrowing bases under asset based credit facilities and the reduced availability of debt or equity financing may result in a decrease in our customers' spending for our products and may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, this crisis and economic uncertainty resulted in an overall decrease in consumer and business spending, which negatively impacted the need our customers have for our products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	While economic conditions have shown signs of improvement in many of our markets, future slow or negative growth in the global economy may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Fluctuations in capacity at both OEMs and job shops; The availability of skilled machinists; The need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life; The need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way; The evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances; Our customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes; General economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In 2011, approximately 74% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Disruptions of capital and trading markets; Changes in import or export licensing requirements; Transportation delays; Civil disturbances or political instability; Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war; Currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; Changes in labor standards; Limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property; Nationalization and expropriation; Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws; Difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and Major health concerns.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Moreover, international conflicts are creating many economic and political uncertainties that are affecting the global economy.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Escalation of existing international conflicts or the occurrence of new international conflicts could severely affect our operations and demand for our products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may face trade barriers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a loss of customers or suppliers.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Trade barriers established by the United States or other countries may interfere with our ability to offer our products in those markets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Competition and trade barriers in those countries could require us to reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions adverse to us.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, our subsidiaries may require future equity-related financing, and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Those approvals may be required from the investment commissions or similar agencies of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local entities.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment and foreign trade, which may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; Diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business; Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development; Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; Difficulties in predicting market demand for acquired products and technologies and the resultant risk of acquiring excess or obsolete inventory; Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Acquisitions may also cause us to:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership; Increase our level of indebtedness; Assume liabilities; Record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and Become subject to litigation.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions, if any, will be successful and will not have material adverse affect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing facilities on acceptable terms; A deterioration in our financial condition that would violate current loan agreement covenants or prohibit us from obtaining additional capital from banks, financial institutions, or investors; Extreme volatility in credit markets that increase margin or credit requirements; and Volatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euros ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD"), and Swiss Francs ("CHF").
313716_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar ("USD").
313716_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, our purchases of components in CNY, EUR, TWD, CHF, and Japanese Yen ("JPY") are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We prepare our financial statements in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Foreign exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our revenues, costs, and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Though we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, and utilize currency exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, changes in exchange rates nonetheless cannot always be predicted or hedged.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Consequently, we cannot assure you that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron castings or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on customer delivery requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	With individual machines priced as high as $1.5 million and several machines frequently sold together as a package, a request by a customer to delay shipment at quarter end could significantly affect our quarterly results.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Given that a larger percentage of our sales are now from Asia, the impact of the one week to two weeks plant shut downs in that region by us and our customers due to the Lunar New Year, the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income may be the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income, and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our market-related value of assets recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the value of our Pension Plan Assets decreased by $7.4 million primarily due to decreases in market value of the underlying assets and plan settlement.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The investment performance of our pension plan assets could significantly impact the growth of those assets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans, discount rates are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Discount rates are used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	An increase to the discount rate would reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would increase pension liability and the future pension expense.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	For pension accounting purposes in our U.S. based plan, which is the largest of our plans, the rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense was 8.00% for 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 5.11% at December 31, 2011 compared to 5.93% at December 31, 2010.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have two defined benefit plans in our Swiss subsidiary.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	When taken as a whole, the two plans are the second largest of our defined benefit plan.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense on plan assets was 3.90% for 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 2.7% for 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we expect to make a cash contribution of approximately $5.7 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2012 and approximately $2.2 million to the foreign plans in 2012.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a contribution in years beyond 2012 may be more or less than the projected 2012 contribution.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	At December 31, 2011, the excess of consolidated projected benefit obligations over plan assets was $45.3 million and the excess of consolidated accumulated benefit obligations over plan assets was $40.2 million.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently underfunded and we will be required to make cash payments to the plan, reducing the cash available for our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We record a liability associated with the U.S. defined benefit pension plan equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The liability recorded at December 31, 2011 was $31.6 million.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We expect to make estimated funding contributions totaling approximately $5.5 million in fiscal 2012, of which $3.9 million represents a receivable contribution for the 2011 plan year.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Contribution levels are largely contingent on asset returns and corporate bond yields.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If the performance of the assets in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan does not meet our expectations and/or corporate bond yields decrease, our future contributions to the plan could increase.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan under limited circumstances.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in relatively small urban areas.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Due to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The technologies within our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The phasing out of an old product involves both estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines as well as to satisfy future repair part needs.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If we suffer damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our factories, facilities, and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In 2011, approximately 69% of our sales were through distributors and agents.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In December 2009, we reorganized our U.S. distribution from a joint distributor network and direct sales force to a new group of distributors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P74_S4	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P77_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	During 2011 and 2010, net orders and related sales were impacted by order cancellations of $15.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the global economic conditions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P80_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Current employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Various federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and costs to terminate or layoff employees.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow:
313716_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	minimum wages; mandated health benefits; paid leaves of absence; mandatory severance payments; and employment taxes.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to certain property we own and on adjacent areas.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P90_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc. (the Potentially Responsible Parties or "PRPs") has agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P92_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and on September 7, 2011 submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P93_S2	The PRPs are continuing to address EPA comments and to perform the tasks required by the RI/FS Work Plan and Administrative Settlement Agreement.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and had found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P95_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of eight members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P106_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:

313716_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	Despite the decrease in consumption, in 2010, orders for metal cutting machines increased by 85% versus 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The AMT's statistics are reported on a voluntary basis from member companies.
313716_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The report includes metal-cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete.
313716_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	One such measurement is the Purchasing Manager's Index ("PMI"), as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Similar information regarding machine tool consumption in foreign countries is published by trade associations in those countries.

313716_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ("sales") and net orders ("orders"), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our bank financing arrangements.
313716_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are also subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We also expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	We continue to monitor our customers' financial condition in order to mitigate our accounts receivable collectability risks.
313716_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollar ("TWD"), and Swiss Franc ("CHF").
313716_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ("USD") at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	During 2011, as compared to the respective average values of our major functional currencies in 2010, the value of USD decreased approximately 4% against GBP, 5% against CNY, 5% against EUR, 7% against TWD, and 18% against CHF.
313716_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The weaker USD resulted in favorable currency translation impact of approximately $18.0 million on new orders and $20.9 million on sales, as compared to 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	For the year ended 2010, on average the value of USD decreased approximately 4% against TWD, 5% against CHF and 9% against the Canadian Dollar, while it strengthened by 3% against EUR and by 2% against GBP compared to the average rates during the same period in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	The USD remained relatively flat against CNY.
313716_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	The net impact of these foreign currencies relative to the USD was a favorable impact on sales of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	In December 2011, we modified our secured revolving credit facility.

313716_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The 2010 loss from operations included $3.5 million for professional services related to an unsolicited tender offer, $0.6 million associated with the settlement of a tax audit in a foreign subsidiary, and $0.3 million related to Jones Shipman acquisition costs.
313716_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Excluding these expenses, income from operations would have been $1.7 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Interest Expense Interest Income: Interest expense includes interest payments under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with these facilities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Interest expense for the year 2011 was $0.3 million compared to $0.4 million for 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease for 2011 compared to 2010 is attributed to lower average interest rates on our existing credit facilities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Interest income was $0.1 million in 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense in 2011 was $4.4 million compared to $2.2 million for 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The effective tax rate was 26.7% in 2011 and 70.7% in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Fundamentally, the income tax expense represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in the income tax expense is the result of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, and a change in the mix of earnings by country, including those countries where losses cannot be fully benefitted due to valuation allowances.
313716_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. U.K., German, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We regularly review recent results and projected future results of operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.

313716_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The percentage calculation is not meaningful.
313716_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	(1) EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
313716_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	EBITDA is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe, provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.
313716_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Orders: Orders for 2010 were $296.7 million, an increase of $121.7 million or 70% compared to 2009 orders of $175.0 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Worldwide demand for machine tools improved during 2010 as reflected in the increases in orders for all of our major markets compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	Reduced orders levels and order cancellation activity in 2009 were directly related to the global economic recession and related financial crisis which affected all of the regions and product lines in which we conduct business, and was generally consistent with overall industry statistics.
313716_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	Asia Other represents 47% of the Company's total orders for 2010 driven by a $35.2 million order in China from a China-based supplier to the consumer electronics industry.
313716_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	Currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on new orders of approximately $2.5 million for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table presents 2010 and 2009 new orders by region:

313716_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in North American orders was driven by strong machine orders which were up $9.4 million or 40% in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase in machine orders can be attributed to the global economy rebounding from the recessionary conditions as well as a successful transition to our new U.S. distributors.
313716_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	European orders increased by $40.4 million or 80% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The acquisition of Jones Shipman in April of 2010 was responsible for 25% of this increase.
313716_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Exclusive of Jones Shipman, the increase in orders for the year was driven by strong machine order activity in Turkey, Germany, and Russia.
313716_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on orders for the year 2010 compared to the prior year was favorable by $1.3 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Asia Other orders increased by $66.6 million or 92% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase was driven by $35.2 million in orders in the year from a China-based supplier to the consumer electronics industry.
313716_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Orders also increased during the year due to several multi-machine orders from consumer electronics and automotive companies in China.

313716_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The geographic mix of sales as a percentage of total sales is shown in the table below:
313716_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	North American sales decreased by $5.9 million or 9% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease was a result of the lagging effects of the global economic recession and was in all of our product lines with the exception of accessories, which experienced an increase in 2010 as overall manufacturing activity began to recover.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	European sales decreased $12.9 million or 15% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	The decrease in 2010 sales was driven by activity during the first six months of 2010 compared to the first six months of 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	The first half of 2009 benefited from sales out of machine backlog which were from orders received before the market collapse in 2008.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	Sales in the last six months of 2010 were up $9.3 million or 24% compared to the last six months of 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S4	This increase was due to the lingering effects of the global economic recession in 2009 combined with the impact of recovery in 2010 during this period.
313716_12_ITEM7_P63_S5	Currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales of $1.0 million for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Asia Other sales increased by $61.7 million or 99% for the year 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	This increase was primarily driven by strong sales in China which increased $50.1 million or 96% for the 2010 year compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Sales in China to a China-based supplier to the consumer electronics industry contributed approximately $29.2 million in sales in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on sales for the year 2010 compared to the prior year was a favorable $2.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Machine sales represented approximately 75% of 2010 and 2009 sales.
313716_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts, and accessories made up the balance.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Gross profit was $61.3 million or 23.8% of sales in 2010, compared to $40.8 million, or 19.1% of sales in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in gross profit is attributable to the $42.9 million increase in sales volume, as well as overall improving margins in 2010 compared to 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The 2009 margins were negatively impacted by heavy discounts as manufacturers and distributors cut prices to reduce inventory.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	This pricing pressure carried into early 2010, but was not as prevalent.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	2009 gross profit was also negatively impacted by an inventory charge of $5.0 million related to the strategic decision to cease manufacturing non-critical parts and certain machine models in our Elmira, NY facility and $1.1 million of lower of cost or market write-downs taken on machines as a result of the 2009 market conditions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S5	Excluding these 2009 non-recurring charges, gross profit for the year 2010 increased by $14.4 million or 31%, compared to the same periods in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P66_S6	Excluding the above mentioned charges, gross margin percentage for the year 2010 and 2009 would have been 23.8% and 21.9%, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense for the year 2010 was $65.7 million, or 25.5% of sales, compared to $68.0 million, or 31.8% of sales, in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	SG A for the year 2010 includes charges of $3.5 million for professional services costs related to the unsolicited tender offer, $0.6 million associated with the settlement of a tax audit in a foreign subsidiary, and $0.3 million related to Jones Shipman acquisition costs.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	SG A for the year 2009 included $4.3 million primarily related to severance costs associated with the discontinuance of manufacturing non-critical parts and certain machine models in our Elmira, NY facility as well as workforce reductions in Europe.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	Exclusive of these charges, SG A for 2010 and 2009 would have been $61.3 million (23.8% of sales) and $63.7 million (29.8% of sales), respectively, a year to year decrease of $2.5 million or 4%.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S4	The $2.5 million decrease was driven by the Company's cost control efforts, offset by increased commissions and variable selling expenses on the higher sales volume, and the impact of our Jones Shipman acquisition.
313716_12_ITEM7_P67_S5	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.8 million for the year 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We recorded non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million in 2009 related to machinery and equipment.
313716_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	During 2009, as part of restructuring our North American manufacturing operations, we ceased manufacturing operations involved in the non-critical parts production in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	In conjunction with this action, we identified assets with a historical cost of $37.9 million and a net book value of $1.9 million that would no longer be used in its operations, of which, assets with a historical cost of $15.0 million and a net book value of $1.1 million were determined to have no value and disposed of resulting in a $1.1 million impairment charge.
313716_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	This charge was determined by an analysis of current book value and the related assets fair value, if any, less costs to sell.
313716_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	(Gain) Loss on Sale of Assets: In 2010, we recorded proceeds of $1.6 million and a gain of $1.0 million from the sale of assets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	The 2009 loss on sale of assets was related to asset disposals in North America and Europe as a result of the Company's restructuring activities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Loss from Operations: Loss from operations in 2010 was $2.7 million compared to $29.7 million in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The 2010 loss from operations included $3.5 million for professional services related to an unsolicited tender offer, $0.6 million associated with the settlement of a tax audit in a foreign subsidiary, and $0.3 million related to Jones Shipman acquisition costs.
313716_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	Excluding these expenses, we would have had income from operations of $1.7 million, a dramatic improvement over 2009 results.
313716_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	This 2010 income from operations of $1.7 million was driven by the second half of the year which had income from operations of $4.9 million, offset by a loss from operations of $4.1 million in the first half of the year.
313716_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	The loss generated during the first six months in 2010 was related to the lingering effects of the global economy, while the income during the last six months of 2010 was driven by the improving sales activity in a majority of our markets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The 2009 loss from operations can primarily be attributed to the lower sales due to the global economic crisis.
313716_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	While the Company aggressively reacted to the severe business downturn through restructuring activities in North America and Europe, the full impact of the reduction was not eliminated.
313716_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	As a result of the 2009 restructuring activities, we recorded an inventory write-down of $5.0 million resulting from discontinued production of non-critical manufacturing parts and certain machines in our Elmira, NY facility, a severance charge of $4.3 million, and $1.7 million due to impairment of machinery and equipment in the Elmira, NY facility.
313716_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	Additionally, during the last half of 2009, the Company, like many machine tool manufacturers, discounted the price of certain machines in order to liquidate inventory resulting in machines being sold at below cost in some cases.
313716_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	Also, as a result of the 2009 price discounting we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $1.5 million for machines remaining in inventory.
313716_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Interest Expense Interest Income: Interest expense includes interest payments under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our credit facility.
313716_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Interest expense for the year 2010 was $0.4 million compared to $1.9 million for 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The decrease for 2010 compared to 2009 is attributed to $1.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the termination of the multi-currency credit facility which was expensed in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Interest income was $0.1 million in 2010 and 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense in 2010 was $2.2 million compared to $1.8 million for 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	The effective tax rate was 70.7% in 2010 and 5.9% in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	The increase in income tax expense is the result of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, and a change in the mix of profits by country, including those countries where losses cannot be fully benefitted due to valuation allowances.
313716_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The income tax expense fundamentally represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. U.K., German, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	In 2010, the valuation allowance increased by $7.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	This was due to an increase of $6.3 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses and other deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, and an increase of $0.8 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K. (and other items recorded in other comprehensive income).
313716_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	We regularly review recent results and projected future results of operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net Loss: Net loss for 2010 was $5.2 million or 2.0% of sales, compared to $33.3 million net loss, or 15.6% of sales in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Basic and diluted loss per share for 2010 was $0.46 compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $2.93 in 2009.
313716_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its operations, including working capital, to purchase and fund improvements to its facilities, machines and equipment, and to fund acquisitions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents were $21.7 million, compared to $30.9 million at December 31, 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The current ratio at December 31, 2011 was 2.25:1 compared to 2.68:1 at December 31, 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The table below shows the changes in cash flows from operating activities by component:
313716_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	In 2011, $7.1 million cash was used in operating activities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Cash was primarily used to fund accounts receivable growth as business activity levels increased from 2010, and used for inventory growth which increased due to higher demand for our products and the related increase in production levels.
313716_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Cash was provided by customer deposits which increased due to higher backlog levels.
313716_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Cash was also provided by accounts payable which increased primarily due to increased purchasing activities to support production activities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2010, $17.1 million cash was provided by operating activities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Cash was provided by accounts payable, which increased primarily due to increased production levels.

313716_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	The increase in capital expenditure was primarily due to $17.2 million spent on the expansion of manufacturing facilities in Switzerland and China in 2011.
313716_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	During 2010, we acquired land use rights in Jiaxing, China for $2.6 million and we used $3.0 million to purchase Jones Shipman.
313716_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	In 2010, we had proceeds of $1.5 million from the sale of machinery and equipment at our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility.

313716_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	During 2011, the increase was due to additional borrowings under our credit facilities to fund working capital needs and borrowing under two new long-term financing arrangements to fund facility expansion in Switzerland and China.
313716_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	Dividend payments increased by $0.3 million in 2011 as a result of increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.005 per share to $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2011.
313716_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, debt outstanding, including notes payable, was $21.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	We maintain several financing arrangements with various financial institutions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	These financing arrangements are in the form of long-term loans, credit facilities, or lines of credit.

313716_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Total consolidated borrowings outstanding were $21.5 million at December 31, 2011 and $5.0 million at December 31, 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	Details of these financing arrangements are discussed below.
313716_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	In May 2006, Hardinge Taiwan Precision Machinery Limited, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary in Taiwan, entered into a mortgage loan with a local bank.
313716_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	The principal amount of the loan is 180.0 million New Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD") ($5.9 million equivalent).
313716_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	The loan, which matures in June 2016, is secured by real property owned and requires quarterly principal payment in the amount of TWD 4.5 million ($0.1 million equivalent).

313716_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	The second facility is secured by certain real property owned by the subsidiary.
313716_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	The interest rate charged by these two facilities, currently at 1.25% for a 90-day borrowing, is determined by the bank based on prevailing money and capital market conditions and the bank's risk assessment of the subsidiary.
313716_12_ITEM7_P101_S5	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The subsidiary also maintains a credit agreement with another bank.
313716_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	This agreement, entered into in October 2009, provided a credit facility of up to CHF 7.0 million ($7.5 million equivalent) for guarantees, documentary credit and margin cover for foreign exchange trades and of which up to CHF 3.0 million ($3.2 million equivalent) of the facility was available for working capital purpose.
313716_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	The facility was secured by the subsidiary's certain real property up to CHF 3.0 million ($3.2 million equivalent).
313716_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	This agreement was amended in August 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P102_S4	The amendment increased the total funds available under the facility to CHF 9.0 million ($9.6 million equivalent), increased the funds available for working capital purposes to CHF $5.0 million ($5.3 million equivalent) and increased the secured amounts to CHF 5.0 million ($5.3 million equivalent).

313716_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.
313716_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The above Kellenberger credit facilities are subject to a minimum equity covenant requirement where the minimum equity for the subsidary must be at least 35% of its balance sheet total assets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with the required covenant.
313716_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	In March 2009, we entered into an agreement with a bank for a $10.0 million term loan due March 16, 2010.

313716_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	This credit facility is secured by substantially all of our U.S. assets (exclusive of real property), a negative pledge on our worldwide headquarters in Elmira, NY, and a pledge of 65% of our investment in Hardinge Holdings GmbH. The credit facility is guaranteed by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which is the owner of the real property comprising our world headquarters.
313716_12_ITEM7_P105_S4	The credit facility does not include any financial covenants.
313716_12_ITEM7_P105_S5	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.
313716_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	We also have a $3.0 million unsecured short-term line of credit from a bank with interest based on the prime rate with a floor of 5.0% and a ceiling of 16.0%.
313716_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	The agreement is negotiated annually, requires no commitment fee and is payable on demand.
313716_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	The principal amount outstanding was $0.5 million at December 31, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM7_P106_S3	There was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2010 on this line of credit.
313716_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	We maintain a standby letter of credit for potential liabilities pertaining to self-insured workers compensation exposure.
313716_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The amount of the letter of credit was $1.2 million at December 31, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	In total, we had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $12.9 million and $8.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	We conduct some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations from leased space, with lease terms up to 10 years, and use office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $2.5 million, $2.1 million, and $1.9 million, during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	The following table shows our future commitments in effect as of December 31, 2011:
313716_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	In 2012, we anticipate making $7.9 million contributions to our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans and $0.4 million contributions to our domestic post-retirement benefit plan.
313716_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	We believe that the currently available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2012.
313716_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following information has been provided in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's requirements for disclosure of exposures to market risk arising from certain market risk sensitive instruments.
313716_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our floating interest rate debt.
313716_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	If market interest rates on debt subject to floating interest rates were to have increased by 2% over the actual rates paid in that year, interest expense would have increased by $0.3 million in 2011 and $0.1 million in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's borrowing cost.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	We currently manufacture our products in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States using production components purchased internationally, and we sell our products in those markets as well as other worldwide markets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	Our subsidiaries in China, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom sell products in local currency to customers in those countries.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S3	These subsidiaries also transact business in currencies other than their functional currency outside of their home country.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S4	Our Taiwanese subsidiary also sells products to foreign purchasers in USD.
313716_12_ITEM7_P116_S5	As a result of these sales in various currencies and in various countries of the world, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products.
313716_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, TWD, CNY and Japanese Yen ("JPY").
313716_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we are exposed to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on our cash flows, earnings and balance sheet.
313716_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	To mitigate this currency risk, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non-functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year.
313716_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies, which were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Changes in metal-cutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_12_ITEM7_P125_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_12_ITEM7_P125_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the company.
313716_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, including some which are no longer in production.
313716_12_ITEM7_P127_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	We have acquired other machine tool companies or assets of companies.
313716_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples and present value of future cash flows.
313716_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	Consequently, the value of purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet has been affected by the use of numerous estimates of the value of assets purchased and of future business opportunity.
313716_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
313716_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using a rate of 5.11% and 5.93% at our plan measurement date of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P134_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in a blended rate of 3.01% and 3.09% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $13.8 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $11.4 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P135_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $12.3 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P135_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $10.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P136_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P136_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.5 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P136_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_12_ITEM7_P137_S2	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_12_ITEM7_P137_S3	We used an expected rate of return of 8.00% and 8.00% at our measurement dates of December 31, 2011 and 2010 for our domestic plan.
313716_12_ITEM7_P137_S4	We used rates of return appropriate for each country for our foreign plans which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 4.24% and 4.23% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P138_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P138_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P138_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
313716_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	Refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.

313716_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

313716_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	We sell our products to customers in North America, Europe and "Asia and Other".
313716_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	A substantial portion of our sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_12_ITEM8_P9_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Occasionally, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits or foreign exchange forward contracts.
313716_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of restricted cash was approximately $4.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	We perform periodic credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers.
313716_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base.
313716_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	trade accounts receivable to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
313716_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.8 million and $4.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	We also review the carrying value of our inventory compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying value accordingly.
313716_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	If future demand for our products is less favorable than our forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods, generally over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
313716_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization.
313716_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment, if indicators of impairment are identified.
313716_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, we use undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	We account for income taxes using the liability method where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	These deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
313716_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
313716_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a company's current and past performance, the market conditions in which the company operates, the utilization of past tax credits, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, sales backlogs, etc. that will result in future profits.
313716_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment and are a major consideration in our decision to establish a valuation allowance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	We also maintain a valuation allowance on our U.K., German, Netherlands, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China and Taiwan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740.
313716_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Interest and penalties are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives and returns.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return machines.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S4	In the rare case that a machine return is permitted, a restocking fee is typically charged.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders which are not eligible for return.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_12_ITEM8_P35_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Prior to shipment, each machine is tested to ensure the machine's compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our promotional literature.
313716_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	On an exception basis, where larger multiple machine installations are delivered which require run-offs and customer acceptance at their facility, revenue is recognized in the period of customer acceptance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	We collect and remit taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the Company and its customers.
313716_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	These taxes may include sales, use and value-added taxes.
313716_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
313716_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Shipping and handling cost are recorded as part of cost of goods sold.
313716_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	We offer warranties for our products.
313716_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we sold the product.
313716_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	We generally provide a basic limited warranty for a period of one to two years.
313716_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair cost history and record a liability for such costs when that product revenue is recognized.
313716_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
313716_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
313716_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	We also sell extended warranties for some of our products.
313716_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	These extended warranties usually cover a 12-24 month period that begins after the basic warranty expires.
313716_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	Revenue from extended warranties are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis across the term of the warranty contract.
313716_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	These liabilities are reported in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The costs associated with research and development programs for new products and significant product improvements are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of goods sold.
313716_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Research and development expenses totaled $12.2 million, $9.4 million and $9.3 million, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
313716_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	Net assets are translated at month end exchange rates while income, expense and cash flow items are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period.
313716_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
313716_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, long-term debt and foreign currency forwards.
313716_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	See Note 10 for additional disclosure.
313716_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	As a multinational Company, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	To manage this risk, we enter into derivative instruments namely in the form of foreign currency forwards.
313716_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	Our derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on balance sheet exposures of both trade and intercompany assets and liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	We hedge this exposure with contracts settling in less than a year.
313716_12_ITEM8_P46_S4	These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
313716_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are recognized immediately in earnings.
313716_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	We have some forward contracts to hedge certain customer orders and vendor firm commitments.
313716_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	These contracts which are for less than two years have maturity dates in alignment with our contractual payment requirements.
313716_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as cash flow hedges.
313716_12_ITEM8_P48_S3	Unrealized gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are charged to other comprehensive income (Loss).
313716_12_ITEM8_P48_S4	Gains or losses on any ineffective portion of the contracts are recognized in earnings.
313716_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	We account for stock-based compensation based on the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and recognize as expense the value of the award over the requisite service period.
313716_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income, postretirement plan adjustments, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on hedging, net of tax, and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.
313716_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.
313716_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
313716_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Net income (loss) available to common shareholders represents net income (loss) reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	Losses are not allocated to participating securities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options.
313716_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Unvested stock-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the earnings allocation in the earnings per share calculation under the two-class method.
313716_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Recipients of restricted stock issued prior to 2011 are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period, therefore, meeting the definition of a participating security.
313716_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Net inventories consist of the following:
313716_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
313716_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Depreciation expense was $6.1 million, $5.7 million and $7.2 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	During 2009, as part of restructuring our North American manufacturing operations, we ceased manufacturing operations involved in the non-critical parts production in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	As a result of this restructuring action, we identified certain property, plant and equipment that would no longer be utilized in our manufacturing operations and classified them as "available for sale".
313716_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	These assets were recorded on the balance sheet at $0.2 million as of December 31, 2009 based on the lower of the assets' carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell, with a related impairment charge of $0.6 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	In addition to the assets that were classified as available for sale, we identified certain property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $1.1 million that would no longer be utilized in our manufacturing operations and disposed of them.
313716_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2009 we recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million related to these assets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	During 2010, we changed our plan to sell some of those assets that had been identified in December 2009.
313716_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	These assets were measured at the lower of their (a) carrying amount before they were classified as "held for sale," adjusted by any depreciation expense or impairment losses that would have been recognized had the assets continuously been classified as "held and used" or (b) fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.
313716_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	As a result of this action, we recorded a $0.03 million credit to the impairment charges in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	During 2010, we recognized a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets primarily related to the sale of the excess machinery and equipment at the Elmira, NY manufacturing facility.
313716_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Summary of the major components of intangible assets are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Amortization expense related to these amortizable intangible assets was $0.8 million for 2011 and 2010 and $0.7 million for 2009.
313716_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	The aggregated amortization expense on existing intangible assets for each of the next five years is approximately $0.8 million, $0.8 million, $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Intangible asset not subject to amortization represent the aggregate value of the trade name, trademarks and copyrights associated with the former worldwide operations of Bridgeport.
313716_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	We use the Bridgeport brand name on all of our machining center lines; therefore, the asset has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.
313716_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	The $0.3 million decrease in the balance from 2010 was the impact of foreign currency exchange.
313716_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	We maintain several financing arrangements with various financial institutions.
313716_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	These financing arrangements are in the form of long-term loans, credit facilities, or lines of credit.
313716_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	In aggregate, these financing arrangements allow us to borrow up to $73.8 million at December 31, 2011, of which $51.7 million can be borrowed for working capital needs.
313716_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	As of December 31, 2011, $43.4 million was available under these arrangements of which $37.1 million was available for working capital needs.

313716_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S., U.K., German and Canadian net deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	In 2011, the valuation allowance increased by $9.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	This was due to an increase of $2.4 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses and other deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands, and an increase of $6.7 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K., (and other items recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)).
313716_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	In 2010, the valuation allowance increased by $7.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	This was due to an increase of $6.3 million due to not recording a tax benefit on losses and other deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, and an increase of $0.8 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K., (and other items recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)).
313716_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had state investment tax credits of $6.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively, expiring at various dates through the year 2018.

313716_12_ITEM8_P91_S2	We also have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $33.4 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P91_S3	The U.S. net operating loss includes approximately $1.6 million of the net operating loss carryforward for which a benefit will be recorded in additional paid in capital when realized.
313716_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	Significant components of income tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	There were no tax refunds in 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	Refunds were $0.5 million in 2010 and $1.4 million in 2009.

313716_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following is a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the United States statutory rate to amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income:
313716_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	At the end of 2011, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to approximately $133.1 million, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state taxes has been provided thereon.
313716_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
313716_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	We had been granted a tax holiday in China which expired in 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	For 2011, our tax rate for our Chinese subsidiary was 24% and our tax rate in China will be 25% in 2012.
313716_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	If recognized, essentially all of the uncertain tax benefits and related interest at December 31, 2011 would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	We record interest and penalties on tax reserves as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	The net increase in interest and net reduction in penalties were immaterial for 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	Accrued interest related to the uncertain tax positions were $0.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P99_S3	Accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $0.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P99_S4	The accrued interest and accrued penalties were reported as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	The tax years 2008 to 2011 remain open to examination by United States taxing authorities and for our other major jurisdictions (Switzerland, U.K., Taiwan, Germany, Netherlands and China); the tax years between 2006 and 2011 generally remain open to routine examination by foreign taxing authorities, depending on the jurisdiction.
313716_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	A reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty accrual is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	Summary of domestic and foreign operations consist of the following:
313716_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	Sales attributable to European and Asian Other operations are based on those sales generated by subsidiaries located in Europe and Asia.
313716_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	Inter-area sales are accounted for at prices comparable to normal, unaffiliated customer sales, reduced by estimated costs not incurred on these sales.
313716_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	In 2010, a customer who is a supplier to the consumer electronics industry accounted for 10.7% of our consolidated sales.
313716_12_ITEM8_P105_S1	We have no single customer who accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2011 or 2009.
313716_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	Machine sales accounted for approximately 77% of 2011 sales and 75% of 2010 and 2009 sales.
313716_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts and accessories made up the balance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	Summary of sales from external customers by country is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	Summary of net property, plant and equipment by country is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	We provide a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all eligible domestic employees hired before March 1, 2004.
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	The plan bases benefits upon both years of service and earnings through 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	Our policy is to fund at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA.
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S3	For our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are governed by their governmental regulations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S4	Each foreign plan requires employee and employer contributions except Hardinge Taiwan, which requires only employer contributions.
313716_12_ITEM8_P109_S5	In 2010, we permanently froze the accrual of benefits under the domestic plan and one of our foreign plans.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	Domestic employees hired on or after March 1, 2004 have retirement benefits under our 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	After one year of service, we will contribute 4% of an employee's pay and will further match 25% of the first 4% that the employee contributes.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	As of June 15, 2009, we suspended the 25% company match as well as the 4% company contribution to the 401(k) plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S3	For 2009, employees were credited with a pro-rata portion of the 4% company contribution which was paid in January 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S4	The suspension of the 25% company match and 4% contribution was rescinded as of January 1, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P110_S5	We made contributions of $0.1 million and $0.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	In conjunction with the permanent freeze of benefit accruals under the domestic defined benefit plan, employees that were actively participating in the domestic defined benefit plan became eligible to receive company contributions in the 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	Additionally, upon reaching age 50, employees who were age 40 or older as of January 1, 2011 and were participants in the domestic defined benefit plan, are also provided enhanced employer contributions in the 401(k) defined contribution plan to compensate for the loss of future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	We recognized $1.5 million of expense for the domestic defined contribution plan in 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	Employees may contribute additional funds to the plan for which there is no required company match.
313716_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	All employer and employee contributions are invested at the direction of the employees in a number of investment alternatives, one being Hardinge Inc. common stock.
313716_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	As a result of the permanent freeze to the accrual of benefits under the domestic plan and one of our foreign plans, we realized a net curtailment gain of $0.3 million in 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	As a result of our 2009 restructuring activities in North America and Europe, we realized a reduction in the number of participants in our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans.
313716_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	Accordingly, in 2009, we recognized settlement and curtailment losses of $0.6 million in our defined benefit pension plans and a curtailment gain of $0.6 million in our other post-retirement benefits plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	We provide a contributory retiree health plan covering all eligible domestic employees who retired at normal retirement age prior to January 1, 1993 and all retirees who have or will retire at normal retirement age after January 1, 1993 with at least 10 years of active service.
313716_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Employees who elect early retirement on or after reaching age 55 are eligible for the plan benefits if they have 15 years of active service at retirement.
313716_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	Benefit obligations and funding policies are at the discretion of management.
313716_12_ITEM8_P114_S3	We also provide a non-contributory life insurance plan to retirees who meet the same eligibility criteria as required for retiree health insurance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P114_S4	Because the amount of liability relative to this plan is insignificant, it is combined with the health plan for purposes of this disclosure.
313716_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	In 2009 and 2008, we offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP") to eligible employees.
313716_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	Employees were eligible to participate in the VERP if the sum of their current age and length of service equaled 94 years.
313716_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	The VERP covers post-retirement health care costs for 60 months or until Medicare coverage begins, whichever occurs first.
313716_12_ITEM8_P115_S3	Through December 31, 2011, we have recognized $1.1 million in costs for the 2009 and 2008 VERP, of which $0.4 million and $0.6 million are included within the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	Increases in the cost of the retiree health plan are paid by the participants with the exception of premium costs for eligible employees who retired under a VERP.
313716_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	For each VERP retiree, we pay the premium in excess of a scheduled amount until they reach Medicare eligibility or for a period not to exceed five years at which point the retiree assumes responsibility for any premium increases.
313716_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	The discount rate for determining benefit obligations in the postretirement benefits plan was 4.92% and 5.50% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	The change in the discount rate increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by $0.1 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	A summary of the pension and postretirement benefits plans' funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The projected benefit obligations for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above were $92.9 million and $92.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	The plan assets for the foreign pension plans included above were $82.4 million and $84.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P119_S2	In addition to the defined pension and postretirement benefits, we have included $0.8 million of retirement benefit liabilities related to a foreign subsidiary in the pension and postretirement liabilities amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2011 and 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	The accumulated benefit obligations were $196.0 million and $185.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except one Swiss plan in 2011 and 2010):
313716_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except Taiwan and one Swiss plan in 2011 and 2010):
313716_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost and postretirement benefit costs for the consolidated company is presented below.
313716_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	The pension cost includes an executive supplemental pension plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	A summary of the changes in pension and postretirement benefits recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss is presented below.
313716_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	The net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above was $1.8 million, $1.7 million, and $2.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	We expect to recognize $2.4 million of net loss, $0.3 million credit of transition asset and $0.1 million of net prior service credit as components of net periodic pension cost in 2012 for our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	We expect to recognize $0.4 million of net prior service credit as a component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2012.
313716_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include:
313716_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations include:
313716_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans (except for the Taiwan plan), discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments or sample benefit payments in the case of the U.K. plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	The discount rate for the Taiwan plan is based on the yield on long-dated government bonds.
313716_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and foreign plans, we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	For the domestic defined benefit plan, the plan targets an asset allocation of approximately 55% equity securities, 36% debt securities and 9% other.
313716_12_ITEM8_P132_S1	For the foreign defined benefit plans, the plans target blended asset allocation of 41% equity securities, 45% debt securities and 14% other.
313716_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	We manage this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	In addition, we ensure that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	Our domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.
313716_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	The selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of management, investment committees, plan trustees and their advisors.
313716_12_ITEM8_P134_S2	The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written investment management agreements, related policy guidelines and applicable governmental regulations regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.
313716_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding.
313716_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	The domestic plan is the largest of all our defined benefit plans.
313716_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	The contributions to this plan for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 totaled $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	The expected contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2012 to the domestic defined benefit plans are approximately $5.7 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P137_S1	We also provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans for our foreign subsidiaries.
313716_12_ITEM8_P137_S2	The expected contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2012 to the foreign defined benefit plans are $2.2 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P137_S3	For each of our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are determined by their governmental regulations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P137_S4	Also, each of the foreign plans requires employee and employer contributions, except for Taiwan, which has only employer contributions.
313716_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
313716_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	We also have employees in certain foreign countries that are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and other employee benefit plans.
313716_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	Related obligations and costs charged to operations for these plans are not material.
313716_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	The foreign entities with defined benefit plans are included in the consolidated pension plans described earlier within this footnote.
313716_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
313716_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	We are using the following fair value hierarchy definition:
313716_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	Level 3 Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	The fair values and classification of our financial instruments measured on a recurring basis is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	Our derivative assets and liabilities are foreign exchange derivatives that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
313716_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments to be active.
313716_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, there were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2.
313716_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of our variable interest rate debt is approximately equal to its carrying value, as the underlying interest rate is variable.
313716_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	During 2011 and 2010, we did not have any significant nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	The fair values and classification of our defined benefit plan assets is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	(1) Growth funds represent a type of fund containing a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities with a goal of capital appreciation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P151_S1	(2) Income funds represent a type of fund with an emphasis on current income as opposed to capital appreciation.
313716_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	government and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments and dividend-paying stocks.
313716_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	(3) Growth and Income funds represent a type of fund containing a combination of growth and income securities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	(4) Hedge funds represent a managed portfolio of investments that use advanced investment strategies such as leveraged, long, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.
313716_12_ITEM8_P153_S2	These funds are subject to quarterly redemptions and advanced notification requirements, as well as the right to delay redemption until sufficient fund liquidity exists.
313716_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	A summary of the changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans assets classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	Most of our defined benefit pension plan's Level 1 assets are debt and equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally.
313716_12_ITEM8_P155_S1	They are measured at fair value using closing prices from active markets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Level 2 assets are typically investments in pooled funds, which are measured based on the value of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
313716_12_ITEM8_P156_S1	The fair value of our Level 3 plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
313716_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as well as on forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiary with the exposure.
313716_12_ITEM8_P157_S1	Generally these contracts have a term of less than one year and are considered derivative instruments.
313716_12_ITEM8_P157_S2	The valuations of these derivatives are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates, and are recorded as either assets or liabilities.
313716_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	We use a group of highly rated domestic and international banks in order to mitigate counterparty risk on our forward contracts.
313716_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	For contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on the contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") into earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
313716_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	We affect the sales line where the underlying exposure is a sales order and cost of sales line where the underlying exposure is a purchase order.
313716_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	As of December 31, 2011, $1.0 million of the unrealized loss on these contracts is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings over the next 12 months.
313716_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	For contracts that are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current earnings as other (income) expense.
313716_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	Notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments not qualifying or designated as hedges were $47.6 million at December 31, 2011 and $19.9 million at December 31, 2010.
313716_12_ITEM8_P162_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31 2010, the loss (gain) related to this type of derivative financial instruments were $1.9 million and ($1.4) million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P162_S2	The gains and losses were recorded in other expense (income) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	Derivative financial instruments qualifying and designated as hedges are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits as a result of normal operations and in the ordinary course of business.
313716_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	Management believes the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to property we own and on adjacent areas.
313716_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM8_P171_S1	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the Potentially Responsible Parties (the "PRPs") have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_12_ITEM8_P173_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM8_P173_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	In May 2008, the EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P174_S1	The PRPs commenced field work in the spring of 2008 and on September 7, 2011 submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA.
313716_12_ITEM8_P174_S2	The PRPs are continuing to address EPA comments and to perform the tasks required by the RI/FS Work Plan and Administrative Settlement Agreement.
313716_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a PRP at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_12_ITEM8_P175_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_12_ITEM8_P175_S2	We have not established a reserve for any potential costs relating to this Site, as it is too early in the process to determine our responsibility as well as to estimate any potential costs to remediate.
313716_12_ITEM8_P175_S3	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	Although we believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 10 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $2.5 million, $2.1 million and $1.9 million, during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	At December 31, 2011, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases for are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company has entered into written employment contracts with its executive officers.
313716_12_ITEM8_P179_S1	The currently effective term of the employment agreements is one year and the agreements contain an automatic, successive one-year extension unless either party provides the other with 60 days prior notice of termination.
313716_12_ITEM8_P179_S2	In the case of a change in control, as defined in the employment contracts, the term of each officer's employment will be automatically extended for a period of two years following the date of the change in control.
313716_12_ITEM8_P179_S3	These employment contracts also provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment, the amount of which is increased upon certain termination events to the extent such events occur within a twelve month period following a change in control.
313716_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company has 20,000,000 common shares of stock authorized and 12,472,992 shares issued.
313716_12_ITEM8_P180_S1	On December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had 11,659,012, 11,607,289 and 11,533,752 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	The number of shares of common stock in treasury was as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	In February 2010, the Company adopted a one-year Shareholders Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock.
313716_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	The Rights are designed to ensure that all our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the case of a takeover bid and to enable our stockholders to realize the full long-term value of their investment.
313716_12_ITEM8_P182_S2	No Rights were exercised under the Shareholder Rights Plan, which expired on March 1, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	We calculate earnings per share using the two class method.
313716_12_ITEM8_P183_S1	Details of the calculations of earnings (loss) per share are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	161,299, 150,262 and 54,933 shares of certain stock-based awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.
313716_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	On May 3, 2011, our shareholders approved the 2011 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan").
313716_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	The Plan's purpose is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders by attracting, retaining, and motivating officers and other key employees who make important contributions to the success of the Company.
313716_12_ITEM8_P185_S2	The Plan reserves 750,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the "Authorized Plan Amount") to be issued for grants of several different types of incentives including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock incentives, and performance share incentives.
313716_12_ITEM8_P185_S3	Any shares of Common Stock granted under options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount on a one-for-one basis and any shares of Common Stock granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount as two (2) shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Common Stock subject to such award.
313716_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Authorized and issued shares of Common Stock or previously issued shares of Common Stock purchased by the Company for purposes of the Plan may be issued under the Plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	Our 2002 Incentive Stock Plan authorized various long-term incentives (the "2002 Plan").
313716_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	Subsequent to May 3, 2011, no grants have or will be made under the 2002 Plan.
313716_12_ITEM8_P187_S2	However, all outstanding awards and grants under the 2002 Plan will remain in effect until the end of the corresponding terms of such awards and grants.
313716_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	All of our stock-based compensation to employees is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in our statement of operations based on the fair value at the grant date of the award.
313716_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	Non-cash stock-based compensation cost was $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in the depreciation and amortization amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
313716_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	Restricted stock/unit awards, performance share incentives and stock options are the only award types currently outstanding.
313716_12_ITEM8_P189_S1	Restricted stock/unit awards and performance share incentives are discussed below.
313716_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	Stock option activity is not significant.
313716_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	We award restricted stock/units (the "RSA") to employees.
313716_12_ITEM8_P191_S1	RSAs vest at the end of the service period and are subject to forfeiture as well as transfer restrictions.
313716_12_ITEM8_P191_S2	During the vesting period, the RSAs are held by the Company and the recipients are entitled to exercise rights pertaining to such shares, including the right to vote such shares.
313716_12_ITEM8_P191_S3	Recipients of RSAs awarded under the 2002 Plan have non-forfeitable rights to receive cash dividends as any other common stock holders.
313716_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	The RSAs are valued based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_12_ITEM8_P192_S1	The total deferred compensation associated with the RSAs awarded in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P192_S2	The deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the specified service period, which ranges from three to six years.
313716_12_ITEM8_P192_S3	Total compensation expense related to RSAs was $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	A summary of the RSA activity is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	We award performance share incentives ("PSI") to employees.
313716_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	PSIs are expressed as shares of the Company's common stock.
313716_12_ITEM8_P194_S2	They are earned only if the Company meets specific performance targets over the specified performance period.
313716_12_ITEM8_P194_S3	During this period, PSI recipients have no voting rights.
313716_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	When we declare dividends, such dividends are deemed to be paid to the recipients.
313716_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	We withhold and accumulate the deemed dividends until such point that the PSIs are earned.
313716_12_ITEM8_P195_S2	If the PSIs are not earned, the accrued dividends are forfeited.
313716_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	The payment of PSIs can be in cash, or in the Company's common stock, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Company.
313716_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	The PSIs are valued based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	In 2011, we granted 54,000 PSIs with a total deferred compensation of $0.7 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P197_S2	We did not grant any such PSIs in 2010 and 2009.
313716_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	The deferred compensation is being recognized into earnings based on the passage of time and achievement of performance targets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P198_S1	Total compensation expense related to PSI in 2011 was $0.2 million.
313716_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	Total comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	(1) Tax effects on foreign currency translation adjustments, in thousands, were ($39), ($398) and $0 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

313716_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	On April 7, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Jones and Shipman Precision Limited, a UK based manufacturer of grinding and super-abrasive machines and machining systems, for GBP 2.0 million ($3.2 million equivalent) from Precision Technologies Group Limited.
313716_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	In conjunction with this asset acquisition, we established Jones Shipman Grinding Limited, a new UK based wholly-owned subsidiary.
313716_12_ITEM8_P202_S2	The results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P202_S3	We expensed acquisition related costs of $0.3 million during 2010 and recorded it in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P202_S4	The acquisition provided us with valuable product lines, as well as the addition of the strong Jones Shipman brand name to our grinding portfolio.
313716_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	The acquisition agreement contains provisions for a contingent purchase price payment based on sales through March 31, 2014.
313716_12_ITEM8_P203_S1	The contingent purchase price payment is 5.42% of sales in excess of GBP 36.4 million ($58.4 million equivalent), with a maximum payment of GBP 0.3 million ($0.5 million equivalent).
313716_12_ITEM8_P203_S2	Based on the Company's forecasted revenue over this period, the fair value of this contingent purchase price was GBP 0.3 ($0.5 million equivalent) and GBP 0.2 (approximately $0.3 million) as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P203_S3	This contingent liability is recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2010:
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were measured at fair value.
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	At the time of the acquisition, inventory was valued based on one of the following methods: for acquired finished products, the value was based on the expected sales price less an allowance for direct selling costs and profits thereon; for acquired work-in-process, the value was based on the expected sales price less an allowance for costs to complete the manufacturing process, direct selling costs and profits thereon; and for acquired raw materials, the value was based on the market price.
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S2	Acquired property, plant and equipment were valued based upon our estimate of replacement cost less an allowance for age and condition at the time of acquisition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S3	The weighted average life of the intangible assets acquired was estimated at 6.6 years at the time of acquisition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S4	Other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities were expected to be settled at face value, and, therefore their respective face value was assumed to approximate fair value.
313716_12_ITEM8_P205_S5	The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price; accordingly, a gain of GBP 0.4 million (approximately $0.6 million) was recorded in 2010 within other expense (income) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	Summarized quarterly financial information for 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
313716_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total earnings (loss) per share of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.
313716_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance on the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services.
313716_12_ITEM8_P208_S1	This pronouncement revises the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit.
313716_12_ITEM8_P208_S2	Specifically, this pronouncement establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is necessary to separately account for each product or service.
313716_12_ITEM8_P208_S3	This hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance.
313716_12_ITEM8_P208_S4	We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2011.
313716_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

313716_12_ITEM8_P210_S3	We do not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to present items of net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
313716_12_ITEM8_P211_S1	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder's equity.
313716_12_ITEM8_P211_S2	The pronouncement will be effective for our fiscal year that begins January 1, 2012 and is to be applied retrospectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P211_S3	Except for presentation requirement, we do not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer the changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
313716_12_ITEM8_P212_S1	This is to allow the FASB time to consider whether such adjustments should be presented on the face of the financial statements for all periods presented.
313716_12_ITEM8_P212_S2	This pronouncement will be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012 and is to be applied retrospectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P212_S3	We do not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of netting assets and liabilities as a single amount in the balance sheet.
313716_12_ITEM8_P213_S1	This pronouncement amends and expands current disclosure requirements on offsetting and requires companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements.
313716_12_ITEM8_P213_S2	This pronouncement is effective for our fiscal year that begins January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively.
313716_12_ITEM8_P213_S3	We do not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

313716_12_ITEM15_P419_S1	Without limitation of the foregoing, such indemnification shall include indemnification against all costs of whatsoever nature or kind, including attorneys fees and costs of investigation or defense, incurred by any such person with respect to any such action or proceeding and any appeal therein, and which judgments, fines, amounts and expenses have not been recouped by him in any other manner.

313716_12_ITEM15_P421_S1	However, no such amendment, suspension or termination shall affect a Participant s or beneficiary s right to receive the benefits accrued in accordance with this Plan as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, suspension or termination.
313716_12_ITEM15_P421_S2	Neither the adoption of the Plan by Hardinge nor any action of Hardinge or the Committee under the Plan shall be held or construed to confer upon any person any legal right to be continued as an employee of Hardinge.
313716_12_ITEM15_P421_S3	All Participants shall be subject to discharge to the same extent as they would have been if the Plan had never been adopted.
313716_12_ITEM15_P421_S4	The Plan shall be binding on Hardinge s successors and assigns and is established under and shall be construed according to the laws of the State of New York.

313716_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based upon this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Hardinge Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
313716_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
313716_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that it maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
313716_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
313716_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 13, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We are a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of machine tools, specializing in precision computer numerically controlled metal-cutting machines.
313716_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company has the following direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries:
313716_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metal-cutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and accessories related to those machines.
313716_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	The grinding machines of Kellenberger, which are manufactured in both computer and manually controlled models, are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser and Tschudin grinding brands.
313716_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2010, the Company established Jones Shipman Grinding Limited after acquiring the assets of Jones and Shipman, a UK-based manufacturer of grinding and super-abrasive machines and machining systems.
313716_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Jones Shipman manufactures and distributes a range of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed and cylindrical) machines used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	In 2012, the Company acquired Usach Technologies, Inc. ("Usach"), an Illinois-based manufacturer of high precision internal and external grinding machines and systems.
313716_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	The acquisition of Usach complements and enhances our grinding product portfolio.
313716_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes and which also may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	On many of our machines, multiple options are available which allow customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Certain parts on machines wear out, fail, or need to be replaced due to misuse over time.
313716_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, we offer an extensive line of accessories including workholding, toolholding, and other industrial support products, which may be used on both our machines and those produced by others.
313716_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, Netherlands, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_13_ITEM1_P24_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our non-machine products are sold in the U.S. mainly through direct telephone orders to a toll-free telephone number and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products through publication of general catalogues and other targeted catalogues, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	We have a considerable presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for workholding, rotary, knee mill products and repair parts.
313716_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 10% our consolidated sales in 2012 or 2011.
313716_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Hardinge Inc. operates in a single business segment, industrial machine tools.
313716_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding and workholding.
313716_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	We compete with numerous vendors in each market sector we serve.
313716_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as Mori-Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma, which are based in Japan, and DMG, which is based in Germany.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss Company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_13_ITEM1_P34_S5	Our accessories products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Kellenberger grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	We produce machining centers and lathes at our facilities in Hardinge Taiwan in Nan Tou, Taiwan and Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. in Jiaxing, China.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S6	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S7	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S8	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_13_ITEM1_P36_S9	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $12.1 million, $12.2 million and $9.4 million, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	In those cases the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_13_ITEM1_P44_S4	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available workholding and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the multiple countries in which we conduct business.
313716_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	In particular, our Elmira, New York manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, New York.
313716_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Hardinge Inc. employed 1,417 persons, 435 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A Risk Factors.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge Inc. could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by the current global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Current global economic and financial difficulties across the world are well documented.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. have intervened in an effort to improve conditions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis which began in 2008, but have also themselves caused instability, uncertainty and doubt which continue to the present.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	As a result, many of our customers have uncertain cash flows and have reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which make commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Fluctuations in capacity at both OEMs and job shops; The availability of skilled machinists; The need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life; The need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way; The evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances; Our customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes; General economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In 2012, approximately 75% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Civil disturbances or political instability; Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war; Currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; Changes in labor standards; Limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property; Nationalization and expropriation; Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws; Difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and Major health concerns.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Moreover, international conflicts are creating many economic and political uncertainties that are affecting the global economy.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Escalation of existing international conflicts or the occurrence of new international conflicts could severely affect our operations and demand for our products.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and anti-corruption regulations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries, and could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not violate our policies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may face trade barriers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a loss of customers or suppliers.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Trade barriers established by the United States or other countries may interfere with our ability to offer our products in those markets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Competition and trade barriers in those countries could require us to reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions adverse to us.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, our subsidiaries may require future equity-related financing, and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Those approvals may be required from the investment commissions or similar agencies of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local entities.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment and foreign trade, which may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; Diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business; Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development; Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; Difficulties in predicting market demand for acquired products and technologies and the resultant risk of acquiring excess or obsolete inventory; Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Acquisitions may also cause us to:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions, if any, will be successful and will not have material adverse affect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Additionally, we may incur significant expenses related to potential acquisitions that are not completed.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products, technologies, facilities, and personnel to an inability to do so.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing facilities on acceptable terms; A deterioration in our financial condition that would violate current loan agreement covenants or prohibit us from obtaining additional capital from banks, financial institutions, or investors; Extreme volatility in credit markets that increase margin or credit requirements; and Volatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euros ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD"), and Swiss Francs ("CHF").
313716_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar ("USD").
313716_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, our purchases of components in CNY, EUR, TWD, CHF, and Japanese Yen ("JPY") are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We prepare our financial statements in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Foreign exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our revenues, costs, and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	currency exchange rates, and utilize currency exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, changes in exchange rates nonetheless cannot always be predicted or hedged.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Consequently, we cannot assure you that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on customer delivery requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	With individual machines priced as high as $1.8 million and several machines frequently sold together as a package, a request by a customer to delay shipment at quarter end could significantly affect our quarterly results.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of the plan shut-downs of one to two weeks in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday, our first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income may be the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income, and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our market-related value of assets recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the value of our pension plan assets increased by $20.9 million primarily due to the strong investment performance.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The investment performance of our pension plan assets could significantly impact the growth of those assets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans, discount rates are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	An increase to the discount rate would reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would increase pension liability and the future pension expense.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and major foreign plans, we consider the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	For pension accounting purposes in our U.S. based plans, which is the largest of our plans, the rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense was 7.75% for 2012 and 8.00% for 2011.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 4.31% at December 31, 2012 compared to 5.11% at December 31, 2011.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have two defined benefit plans associated with our Swiss subsidiary.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	When viewed in aggregate, these two plans constitute the second largest of our defined benefit plans.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense on plan assets was 3.70% for 2012 and 3.90% for 2011.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 2.00% at December 31, 2012 compared to 2.70% at December 31, 2011.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	During 2012, Congress enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act ("MAP-21").
313716_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In the short-term, MAP-21 will increase the discount rates used to determine funding liabilities, resulting in significantly lower pension contributions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As a result of MAP-21 and based on the assumptions and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we expect to make no cash contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan and a contribution of approximately $0.5 million to our U.S. based supplemental pension plans in 2013.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We also expect to make contributions of approximately $2.5 million to the foreign plans in 2013.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P57_S4	If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in years beyond 2013 may be more or less than the projected 2013 contributions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	At December 31, 2012, the excess of consolidated projected benefit obligations over plan assets was $47.1 million and the excess of consolidated accumulated benefit obligations over plan assets was $41.9 million.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently underfunded and we will be required to make cash payments to the plan, reducing the cash available for our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We record a liability associated with the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The liability recorded at December 31, 2012 was $34.3 million.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	As a result of the enactment of MAP-21, we do not expect to make any funding contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2013.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Contribution levels are largely contingent on asset returns and corporate bond yields.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If the performance of the assets in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan does not meet our expectations and/or corporate bond yields decrease, our future contributions to the plan could increase.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan under limited circumstances.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas, which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Due to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The technologies within our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The phasing out of an old product involves both estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines as well as to satisfy future repair part needs.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If we suffer damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our factories, facilities, and distribution system are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In 2012, approximately 72% of our sales were through distributors and agents.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P73_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 6% of our consolidated sales in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P78_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	During 2012 and 2011, net orders and related sales were impacted by order cancellations of $4.6 million and $15.9 million, respectively, primarily due to the global economic conditions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P81_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Current employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Various federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and costs to terminate or layoff employees.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow:
313716_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	mandatory severance payments; and employment taxes.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P90_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P91_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P93_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P93_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P98_S2	The loss of senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of eight members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P103_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to its operations.
313716_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	None of the litigation in which we are currently involved, individually or in the aggregate, is anticipated to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

313716_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) 2009 results include a non-cash charge for impairment of $1.7 million associated with certain machinery and equipment formerly utilized in the manufacture of non-critical parts in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	2008 results include a non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $24.3 million due to the diminished value of goodwill and intangible assets in our Canadian, English, and Swiss entities.
313716_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	(2) We adopted the provisions of ASC 260 on January 1, 2009, which establishes that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
313716_13_ITEM6_P1_S3	The adoption of these provisions resulted in an increase in basic and diluted loss per share of $0.01 in 2008.
313716_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our primary business is designing, manufacturing, and distributing high-precision computer controlled metal-cutting turning, grinding, and milling machines and related accessories.
313716_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ("U.S."), China, and the United Kingdom ("U.K.") with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Approximately 75% of our 2012 sales were to customers outside of North America, 80% of our 2012 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 69% of our employees were outside of North America.
313716_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our machine products are considered to be capital goods and are part of what has historically been a highly cyclical industry.
313716_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our management believes that a key performance indicator is our order level as compared to industry measures of market activity levels.
313716_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	General economic growth around the world was slower than 2011 driven by the decelerating economy in China and uncertainties surrounding European financial and fiscal conditions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	The concerns over economic situations negatively impacted our customers' decision for capital spending.
313716_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Consequently, 2012 order volumes decreased by $84.5 million, or 23%, compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity watched by our management include world machine tool consumption (a proxy for shipments), as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report and metal-cutting machine orders as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology ("AMT"), the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	World machine tool consumption data as reported by the Metalworking Insiders Report showed a decrease in machine tool consumption of 2.5% in 2012 compared to an increase of 34.3% in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	This report indicates that 2012 consumption in China, the world's largest market, decreased by 1% (in US dollars) after a 35% increase in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Consumption in Germany, the world's fourth largest market, saw no change in consumption as measured in local currency in 2012 compared to an increase of 42% in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	In the United Kingdom, machine tool consumption measured in local currency increased by 11% in 2012 and 28% in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	In the U.S., 2012 machine tool consumption increased by 19%, as compared to a 53% increase in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	In 2012, U.S. orders for metal-cutting machine tools reported by the AMT were $5.7 billion, relatively flat when compared to $5.6 billion reported in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	The AMT's statistics are reported on a voluntary basis from member companies.
313716_13_ITEM7_P3_S8	The report includes metal-cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete.
313716_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index ("PMI"), as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Similar information regarding machine tool consumption in foreign countries is published by trade associations in those countries.
313716_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, accessories, repair parts and service revenue, historically account for approximately 24% of overall sales and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines.
313716_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ("sales") and net orders ("orders"), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our bank financing arrangements.
313716_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are also subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	We also expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We continue to monitor our customers' financial condition in order to mitigate our accounts receivable collectability risks.
313716_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollar ("TWD"), and Swiss Franc ("CHF").
313716_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ("USD") at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Below is a summary of the percentage changes for the annual average rates of our functional currencies as compared to their respective USD equivalents:
313716_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The fluctuations of the foreign currency exchange rates during 2012 resulted in unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately $3.9 million on new orders and $4.8 million on sales, as compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The fluctuations of the foreign currency exchange rates during 2011 resulted in favorable currency translation impact of approximately $18.0 million on new orders and $20.9 million on sales, as compared to 2010.
313716_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following table summarizes certain financial data for 2012 and 2011:
313716_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Orders: Orders for 2012 were $288.4 million, a decrease of $84.5 million or 23% compared to 2011 orders of $372.9 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease from 2011 was the result of lower demand for machine tools attributable, in part, to the decelerating Chinese economy along with the uncertainty in Europe due to overall economic and fiscal conditions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The decrease was also the result of exceptional growth experienced by machine tool industry during the first half of 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our order volumes during 2011 were at historically high levels as customers reacted to the increasing prices and extended lead times which were driven by constraints on the machine tool supply chain due to considerable improvement in worldwide demand caused by a strong recovery in the industry.
313716_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on orders of approximately $3.9 million for the year 2012 compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The following table presents 2012 and 2011 orders by region:
313716_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	North America orders decreased by $16.5 million or 17% for the year 2012 compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease in North America orders was driven, in part, as our U.S.-based distributors' slowed their order levels to manage inventory.
313716_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, order levels during the first half of 2011 were high as our distributors gained traction in the market along with their end customers reacting to longer lead times resulting from supply chain constraints and potential for price increase due to the rising costs of raw material and components.
313716_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Europe orders decreased by $14.4 million or 12% for the year 2012 compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately $5.4 million to the overall decrease.
313716_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, Europe orders decreased by 9.0 million, or 8%, when compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	The decrease in order level over the prior year was attributable to the challenging economic and fiscal climate in the region.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Asia orders decreased by $53.6 million or 34% for the year 2012 compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately $1.5 million when compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Excluding the favorable foreign currency impact, Asia orders decreased by $55.1 million, or 35%, when compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	The decrease was driven by soft demand, especially during the first nine months of the year, as a result of the decelerating Chinese economy during 2012 in contrast to a stimulated economy during the first nine months of 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	The overall impact of the macroeconomic factors in 2011 was further influenced by supply chain constraints and customers placing orders to ensure deliveries as a result of long lead times for machine tools.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	Additionally, multiple machine orders from suppliers to the consumer electronics industry in China were $6.1 million in 2012, a $13.9 million decrease compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	Excluding such orders, Asia orders decreased by $39.7 million, or 29%, compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Sales: S ales for 2012 were $334.4 million, a decrease of $7.2 million or 2% compared to 2011 sales of $341.6 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately $4.8 million when compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, sales decreased by $2.4 million, or 1%, when compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table presents 2012 and 2011 sales by region:
313716_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The geographic mix of sales as a percentage of total sales is shown in the table below:
313716_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	North America sales decreased by $6.5 million or 7% for the year 2012 compared to 2011.
313716_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The decrease in North America sales was primarily due to strong sales of grinding machines in 2011 as compared to 2012.

313716_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	In December, 2012, we extended the maturity date of the facility to March 31, 2014 and reduced the interest rate from the daily one-month LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum to daily one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum.
313716_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	This credit facility is secured by substantially all of our U.S. assets (exclusive of real property), a negative pledge on our worldwide headquarters in Elmira, NY, and a pledge of 65% of our investment in Hardinge Holdings GmbH.

313716_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 10 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $3.0 million, $2.5 million and $2.1 million, during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The following table shows our future commitments in effect as of December 31, 2012:
313716_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	In 2013, we expect to make approximately $2.5 million contributions to our foreign defined benefit pension plans and $0.5 million contributions to our domestic supplemental retirement plans.
313716_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	We do not expect to make any cash contribution to our qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2013.
313716_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	We believe that the current available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2013.
313716_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	The following information has been provided in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's requirements for disclosure of exposures to market risk arising from certain market risk sensitive instruments.
313716_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our floating interest rate debt.
313716_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's outstanding borrowings.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	We currently manufacture our products in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States using production components purchased internationally, and we sell our products in those markets as well as other worldwide markets.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	Our subsidiaries in China, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom sell products in local currency to customers in those countries.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	These subsidiaries also transact business in currencies other than their functional currency outside of their home country.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S4	As a result of these sales in various currencies and in various countries of the world, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S5	Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, TWD, CNY and JPY.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S6	As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we are exposed to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on our cash flows, earnings and balance sheet.
313716_13_ITEM7_P107_S7	To mitigate this currency risk, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non-functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year.
313716_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies, which were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Changes in metal-cutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the company.
313716_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	We have acquired other machine tool companies and, in certain instances, the assets of machine tool companies.
313716_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	When doing so, we have estimated the fair value of the assets acquired, and have used traditional models for establishing purchase price based on EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples and present value of future cash flows.
313716_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	Consequently, the value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet has been affected by the use of numerous estimates of the value of assets purchased and of future business opportunity.
313716_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when indictors of impairment are present.
313716_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
313716_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using a rate of 4.31% and 5.11% at our plan measurement date of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM7_P123_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in a blended rate of 2.34% and 3.01% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $16.9 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $12.9 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P124_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $14.2 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P124_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $11.7 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P125_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.3 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P125_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.2 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_13_ITEM7_P127_S2	For our domestic plans, the expected rate of return during fiscal 2013 is 7.75%, the same as the rate used for fiscal 2012.
313716_13_ITEM7_P127_S3	For our foreign plans, we used rates of return appropriate for each country which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 3.91% for fiscal 2013, as compared to 4.07% for fiscal 2012.
313716_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P128_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P128_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	Refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.

313716_13_ITEM7_P131_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company's entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company's ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors' actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations.
313716_13_ITEM7_P131_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_13_ITEM7_P131_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.

313716_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

313716_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	We sell our products to customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
313716_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	A substantial portion of our sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Occasionally, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits or foreign exchange forward contracts.
313716_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the amount of restricted cash was approximately $2.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	We perform periodic credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers.
313716_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base.
313716_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	trade accounts receivable to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
313716_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.3 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	We also review the carrying value of our inventory compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying value accordingly.
313716_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	If future demand for our products is less favorable than our forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods, generally over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
313716_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill and other separately recognized intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization.
313716_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	We conduct this impairment review more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	For goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
313716_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	If, after assessing these events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed to perform a two-step impairment analysis.
313716_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	For other separately recognized intangible assets with indefinite lives, we use a qualitative approach to test such assets for impairment if certain conditions are met.
313716_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment, if indicators of impairment are identified.
313716_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, we use undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.
313716_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	We also maintain a valuation allowance on our U.K., German, Dutch, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	We also maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of one of our Swiss subsidiaries.
313716_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China and Taiwan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold in accordance with ASC 740.
313716_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
313716_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives and returns.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return machines.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S4	In the rare case that a machine return is permitted, a restocking fee is typically charged.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders which are not eligible for return.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_13_ITEM8_P38_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
313716_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Prior to shipment, each machine is tested to ensure the machine's compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our promotional literature.
313716_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	On an exception basis, where larger multiple machine installations are delivered which require run-offs and customer acceptance at their facility, revenue is recognized in the period of customer acceptance.
313716_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	We collect and remit taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the Company and its customers.
313716_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	These taxes may include sales, use and value-added taxes.
313716_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
313716_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Shipping and handling costs are recorded as part of cost of goods sold.
313716_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	We offer warranties for our products.
313716_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we sold the product.
313716_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	We generally provide a basic limited warranty for a period of one to two years.
313716_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	liability for such costs when that product revenue is recognized.
313716_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
313716_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
313716_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	We also sell extended warranties for some of our products.
313716_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	These extended warranties usually cover a 12-24 month period that begins after the basic warranty expires.
313716_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	Revenue from extended warranties are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis across the term of the warranty contract.
313716_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	These liabilities are reported in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The costs associated with research and development programs for new products and significant product improvements are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of goods sold.
313716_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	Research and development expenses totaled $12.1 million, $12.2 million and $9.4 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
313716_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Net assets are translated at month end exchange rates while income, expense and cash flow items are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period.
313716_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	Translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
313716_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included as a component of other income and expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, long-term debt and foreign currency forwards.
313716_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	See Note 10 for additional disclosure.
313716_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	As a multinational Company, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	To manage this risk, we enter into derivative instruments namely in the form of foreign currency forwards.
313716_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	Our derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on balance sheet exposures of both trade and intercompany assets and liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P50_S3	We hedge this exposure with contracts settling in less than a year.
313716_13_ITEM8_P50_S4	These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
313716_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are recognized immediately in earnings.
313716_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	We have some forward contracts to hedge certain customer orders and vendor firm commitments.
313716_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	These contracts which are for less than two years have maturity dates in alignment with our contractual payment requirements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as cash flow hedges.
313716_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Gains or losses on any ineffective portion of the contracts are recognized in earnings.
313716_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	We account for stock-based compensation based on the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and recognize as expense the value of the award over the requisite service period.
313716_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.
313716_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
313716_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Net income (loss) available to common shareholders represents net income (loss) reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	Losses are not allocated to participating securities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options.
313716_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Unvested stock-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the earnings allocation in the earnings per share calculation under the two-class method.
313716_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Recipients of restricted stock issued prior to 2011 are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period, therefore, meeting the definition of a participating security.
313716_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Net inventories consist of the following:
313716_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

313716_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	During 2010, we recognized a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets primarily related to the sale of machinery and equipment classified as "held for sale" at the Elmira, NY manufacturing facility.
313716_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	A summary of goodwill activities follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	In 2012, we recorded $8.5 million in goodwill and $9.4 million in other identifiable intangible assets associated with a business acquisition.

313716_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company's pre-tax income (loss) for domestic and foreign sources is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	Significant components of income tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following is a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the United States statutory rate to amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:
313716_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	Current deferred tax assets of $2.2 million and $1.6 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively, are reported in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	Non-current deferred tax assets of $0.6 million and $0.9 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively, are reported in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	In 2012, the valuation allowance decreased by $5.0 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	$2.7 million of the decrease is due to changes in the Company's existing U.S. valuation allowance as a result of its acquisition of Usach Technologies, Inc. which resulted in an income tax benefit.
313716_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	The remaining decrease of $2.3 million was due to operational results in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Canada, France, and the Netherlands, offset by an increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and other items recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).
313716_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	In 2011, the valuation allowance increased by $9.1 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	$2.4 million of the increase was due to operational results in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands, and an increase of $6.7 million due to the net increase in minimum pension liabilities in the U.S. and the U.K., and other items recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).
313716_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	At December 31, 2012, we have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $61.5 million and $28.6 million, respectively, which expire from 2023 through 2031.
313716_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The U.S. net operating loss includes approximately $2.1 million of the net operating loss carryforwards for which a benefit will be recorded in additional paid in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when realized.
313716_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	In addition, we have state investment tax credits of $6.9 million which have no expiration date.
313716_13_ITEM8_P99_S2	We also have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $44.7 million, of which $14.6 million will expire between 2017 through 2032, and of which $ 30.1 million have no expiration date.
313716_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	At the end of 2012, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to approximately $119.1 million, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for taxes has been provided thereon.
313716_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	Given the complexities of the foreign tax credit calculations, it is not practicable to compute the tax liability that would be due upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or liquidation or sale of our foreign subsidiaries.
313716_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	We had been granted a tax holiday in China which expired in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	For 2011, our tax rate for our Chinese subsidiary was 24% and our tax rate in China was 25% in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	If recognized, essentially all of the uncertain tax positions and related interest at December 31, 2012 would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	It is reasonably possible that certain of our uncertain tax positions pertaining to our foreign operations may change within the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	We estimate the change in uncertain tax positions for these items to be between $0.1 million and $0.9 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The net increase in interest and net reduction in penalties were immaterial for 2012 and 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P105_S2	Accrued interest related to the uncertain tax positions was $0.7 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P105_S3	Accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $0.2 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

313716_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	The tax years 2011 and 2012 remain open to examination by the U.S. federal taxing authorities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	The tax years 2008 through 2012 remain open to examination by the U.S. state taxing authorities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	our other major jurisdictions (Switzerland, U.K., Taiwan, Germany, Netherlands and China); the tax years between 2006 and 2012 generally remain open to routine examination by foreign taxing authorities, depending on the jurisdiction.
313716_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	A reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty accrual is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	Summary of domestic and foreign operations consist of the following:
313716_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	Sales attributable to European and Asian operations are based on those sales generated by subsidiaries located in Europe and Asia.
313716_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	Inter-area sales are accounted for at prices comparable to normal, unaffiliated customer sales, reduced by estimated costs not incurred on these sales.
313716_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	We have no single customer who accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2012 or 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	In 2010, a customer who is a supplier to the consumer electronics industry accounted for 10.7% of our consolidated sales.
313716_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	Machine sales accounted for approximately 78% of 2012 sales, 77% of 2011 sales and 75% of 2010 sales.
313716_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts and accessories made up the balance.
313716_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	Summary of sales to external customers by country is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	Summary of net property, plant and equipment by country is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	We provide a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all eligible domestic employees hired before March 1, 2004.
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S1	The plan bases benefits upon both years of service and earnings through June 15, 2009.
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S2	Our policy is to fund at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA.
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S3	For our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are governed by their governmental regulations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S4	Each foreign plan requires employee and employer contributions except Hardinge Taiwan, which requires only employer contributions.
313716_13_ITEM8_P116_S5	In 2010, we permanently froze the accrual of benefits under the domestic plan and one of our foreign plans.
313716_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Domestic employees hired on or after March 1, 2004 have retirement benefits under our 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	will further match 25% of the first 4% that the employee contributes.
313716_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	The June 15, 2009 suspension of the 25% company match as well as the 4% company contribution to the 401(k) plan was rescinded on January 1, 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P118_S2	We made contributions of $1.4 million and $0.1 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	In conjunction with the permanent freeze of benefit accruals under the domestic defined benefit pension plan, employees that were actively participating in the domestic defined benefit pension plan became eligible to receive company contributions in the 401(k) plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	Additionally, upon reaching age 50, employees who were age 40 or older as of January 1, 2011 and were participants in the domestic defined benefit pension plan are provided enhanced employer contributions in the 401(k) plan to compensate for the loss of future benefit accruals under the defined benefit pension plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P119_S2	We recognized $1.6 million and $1.5 million of expense for the domestic defined contribution plan in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P119_S3	Employees may contribute additional funds to the plan for which there is no required company match.
313716_13_ITEM8_P119_S4	All employer and employee contributions are invested at the direction of the employees in a number of investment alternatives, one being Hardinge Inc. common stock.
313716_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	As a result of the permanent freeze to the accrual of benefits under the domestic plan and one of our foreign plans, we realized a net curtailment gain of $0.3 million in 2010.
313716_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	In 2012, we recognized a $3.2 million prior service credit in two of our foreign pension plans as a result of a plan amendment that changed the interest rates used to convert lump sums to annuity payments.
313716_13_ITEM8_P120_S2	This change is consistent with the lower interest rate environment in the jurisdiction which these two pension plans exist.
313716_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	We provide a contributory retiree health plan covering all eligible domestic employees who retired at normal retirement age prior to January 1, 1993 and all retirees who have or will retire at normal retirement age after January 1, 1993 with at least 10 years of active service.
313716_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	Employees who elect early retirement on or after reaching age 55 are eligible for the plan benefits if they have 15 years of active service at retirement.
313716_13_ITEM8_P121_S2	Benefit obligations and funding policies are at the discretion of management.
313716_13_ITEM8_P121_S3	We also provide a non-contributory life insurance plan to retirees who meet the same eligibility criteria as required for retiree health insurance.
313716_13_ITEM8_P121_S4	Because the amount of liability relative to this plan is insignificant, it is combined with the health plan for purposes of this disclosure.
313716_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	In 2009 and 2008, we offered a Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP") to eligible employees.
313716_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	Employees were eligible to participate in the VERP if the sum of their current age and length of service equaled 94 years.
313716_13_ITEM8_P122_S2	The VERP covers post-retirement health care costs for 60 months or until Medicare coverage begins, whichever occurs first.
313716_13_ITEM8_P122_S3	Through December 31, 2012, we have recognized $1.1 million in costs for the 2009 and 2008 VERP, of which $0.2 million and $0.4 million are included within the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	Increases in the cost of the retiree health plan are paid by the participants with the exception of premium costs for eligible employees who retired under a VERP.
313716_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	For each VERP retiree, we pay the premium in excess of a scheduled amount until they reach Medicare eligibility or for a period not to exceed five years at which point the retiree assumes responsibility for any premium increases.
313716_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	The discount rate for determining benefit obligations in the postretirement benefits plan was 4.21% and 4.92% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	The change in the discount rate increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by $0.2 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	A summary of the pension and postretirement benefits plans' funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	The projected benefit obligations for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above were $104.3 million and $92.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	The plan assets for the foreign pension plans included above were $94.8 million and $82.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

313716_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except one Swiss plan in 2012 and 2011):
313716_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets (all plans except Taiwan and one Swiss plan in 2012 and 2011):
313716_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost and postretirement benefit costs for the consolidated company is presented below.
313716_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	The pension cost includes an executive supplemental pension plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	A summary of the changes in pension and postretirement benefits recognized in other comprehensive loss is presented below:
313716_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	The net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above was $1.9 million, $1.8 million, and $1.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	We expect to recognize $3.2 million of net loss, $0.3 million credit related to transition assets and $0.4 million of net prior service credit as components of net periodic pension cost in 2013 for our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	We expect to recognize $0.3 million of net prior service credit as a component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2013.
313716_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include:
313716_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations include:
313716_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans (except for the Taiwan plan), discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	The discount rate for the Taiwan plan is based on the yield on long-dated government bonds plus a spread.
313716_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and foreign plans, we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	For the domestic defined benefit pension plan, the plan targets an asset allocation of approximately 55% equity securities, 36% debt securities and 9% other.
313716_13_ITEM8_P139_S1	For the foreign defined benefit pension plans, the plans target blended asset allocation of 41% equity securities, 45% debt securities and 14% other.
313716_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	Given the relatively long horizon of our aggregate obligation, our investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of our domestic and foreign plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility.
313716_13_ITEM8_P140_S1	We manage this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P140_S2	In addition, we ensure that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	Our domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.
313716_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	The selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of management, investment committees, plan trustees and their advisors.
313716_13_ITEM8_P141_S2	The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written investment management agreements, related policy guidelines and applicable governmental regulations regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.
313716_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute to our defined benefit pension plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding.
313716_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	The domestic plan is the largest of all our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	The contributions to this plan for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 totaled $5.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	During 2012, Congress enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act ("MAP-21").
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	In the short-term, MAP-21 will increase the discount rates used to determine funding liabilities, resulting in significantly lower pension contributions.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S2	As a result of MAP-21, no contributions are expected to be made to our domestic defined benefit pension plan during the year ending December 31, 2013.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S3	We also provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans for our foreign subsidiaries.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S4	The expected contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2013 to the foreign defined benefit pension plans are $2.5 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S5	For each of our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are determined by their governmental regulations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P144_S6	Also, each of the foreign plans requires employee and employer contributions, except for Taiwan, which has only employer contributions.
313716_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
313716_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	We also have employees in certain foreign countries that are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and other employee benefit plans.
313716_13_ITEM8_P146_S1	Related obligations and costs charged to operations for these plans are not material.
313716_13_ITEM8_P146_S2	The foreign entities with defined benefit pension plans are included in the consolidated pension plans described earlier within this footnote.
313716_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
313716_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	We are using the following fair value hierarchy definition:
313716_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	Level 3 Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
313716_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are based on the fair values of identical assets in active markets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	The fair value of notes payable to bank and variable interest rate debt are based on the present value of expected future cash flows.
313716_13_ITEM8_P152_S2	Due to the short period to maturity or the nature of the underlying liability, the fair value of notes payable to bank and variable interest rate debt approximates their respective carrying amounts.
313716_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	The contingent purchase price payment represents the contingent liabilities associated with the earn-out provisions from the 2012 acquisition of Usach Technologies, Inc. and 2010 acquisition of Jones Shipman (refer to Footnote 17 for a detailed discussion of these acquisitions) .
313716_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	The fair value of the contingent purchase price payment is based on the present value of the estimated aggregated payment amount.
313716_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments to be active.
313716_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2.
313716_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	As described in Footnote 17, the Company completed an acquisition in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	The fair value measurements for the acquired intangible assets were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon significant unobservable Level 3 inputs which include the following:
313716_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	The following table presents the fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of the foreign currency forward contracts:
313716_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	During 2011, we did not have any significant nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	The fair values and classification of our defined benefit plan assets is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	(1) Growth funds represent a type of fund containing a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities with a goal of capital appreciation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	(2) Income funds represent a type of fund with an emphasis on current income as opposed to capital appreciation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	Such funds may contain a variety of domestic and international government and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments and dividend-paying stocks.
313716_13_ITEM8_P162_S2	(3) Growth and Income funds represent a type of fund containing a combination of growth and income securities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P162_S3	(4) Hedge funds represent a managed portfolio of investments that use advanced investment strategies such as leveraged, long, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.
313716_13_ITEM8_P162_S4	These funds are subject to quarterly redemptions and advanced notification requirements, as well as the right to delay redemption until sufficient fund liquidity exists.
313716_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	A summary of the changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans assets classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	Most of our defined benefit pension plan's Level 1 assets are debt and equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally.
313716_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	They are measured at fair value using closing prices from active markets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	The Level 2 assets are typically investments in pooled funds, which are measured based on the value of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
313716_13_ITEM8_P165_S1	The fair value of our Level 3 plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
313716_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as well as on forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiary with the exposure.
313716_13_ITEM8_P166_S1	Generally these contracts have a term of less than one year and are considered derivative instruments.
313716_13_ITEM8_P166_S2	The valuations of these derivatives are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates, and are recorded as either assets or liabilities.
313716_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	We use a group of highly rated domestic and international banks in order to mitigate counterparty risk on our forward contracts.
313716_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") into earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
313716_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	We affect the sales line where the underlying exposure is a sales order and cost of sales line where the underlying exposure is a purchase order.
313716_13_ITEM8_P168_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we expect immaterial amount of the unrealized gain or loss on these contracts to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings over the next 12 months.
313716_13_ITEM8_P168_S3	During 2012, we reclassified $0.2 million and $0.7 million from AOCI to the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an increase in sales and cost of goods sold, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P168_S4	The amounts reclassified from AOCI to sales and cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were not material.
313716_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	For contracts that are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current earnings as other (income) expense.
313716_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	Notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments not qualifying or designated as hedges were $60.5 million at December 31, 2012 and $47.6 million at December 31, 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P170_S1	The net gain realized related to this type of derivative financial instruments was immaterial in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P170_S2	We realized losses of $1.9 million and gains of $1.4 million related to this type of derivative financial instruments in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P170_S3	The gains and losses were recorded in other expense (income) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	Derivative financial instruments qualifying and designated as hedges are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits as a result of normal operations and in the ordinary course of business.
313716_13_ITEM8_P172_S1	Management believes the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_13_ITEM8_P173_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM8_P178_S1	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_13_ITEM8_P179_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_13_ITEM8_P181_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_13_ITEM8_P182_S2	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P182_S3	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond.
313716_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 10 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_13_ITEM8_P185_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $3.0 million, $2.5 million and $2.1 million, during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	At December 31, 2012, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company has entered into written employment contracts with its executive officers.
313716_13_ITEM8_P187_S1	The currently effective term of the employment agreements is one year and the agreements contain an automatic, successive one-year extension unless either party provides the other with 60 days prior notice of termination.
313716_13_ITEM8_P187_S2	In the case of a change in control, as defined in the employment contracts, the term of each officer's employment will be automatically extended for a period of two years following the date of the change in control.
313716_13_ITEM8_P187_S3	These employment contracts also provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment, the amount of which is increased upon certain termination events to the extent such events occur within a twelve month period following a change in control.
313716_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company has 20,000,000 common shares of stock authorized and 12,472,992 shares issued.
313716_13_ITEM8_P188_S1	On December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we had 11,732,714, 11,659,012 and 11,607,289 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	The number of shares of common stock in treasury was as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	We calculate earnings per share using the two class method.
313716_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	Details of the calculations of earnings (loss) per share are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	145,262, 161,299 and 150,262 shares of certain stock-based awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.
313716_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	On May 3, 2011, our shareholders approved the 2011 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan").
313716_13_ITEM8_P192_S1	The Plan's purpose is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders by attracting, retaining, and motivating officers and other key employees who make important contributions to the success of the Company.
313716_13_ITEM8_P192_S2	The Plan reserves 750,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the "Authorized Plan Amount") to be issued for grants of several different types of incentives including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock incentives, and performance share incentives.
313716_13_ITEM8_P192_S3	Any shares of Common Stock granted under options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount on a one-for-one basis and any shares of Common Stock granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount as two (2) shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Common Stock subject to such award.
313716_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	or previously issued shares of Common Stock purchased by the Company for purposes of the Plan may be issued under the Plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	Our 2002 Incentive Stock Plan authorized various long-term incentives (the "2002 Plan").
313716_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	Subsequent to May 3, 2011, no grants have or will be made under the 2002 Plan.
313716_13_ITEM8_P194_S2	However, all outstanding awards and grants under the 2002 Plan will remain in effect until the end of the corresponding terms of such awards and grants.
313716_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	All of our stock-based compensation to employees is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the fair value at the grant date of the award.
313716_13_ITEM8_P195_S1	These non-cash compensation costs were included in the depreciation and amortization amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
313716_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	A summary of stock-based compensation expense is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	Restricted stock/unit awards, performance share incentives and stock options are the only award types currently outstanding.
313716_13_ITEM8_P197_S1	Restricted stock/unit awards and performance share incentives are discussed below.
313716_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	Stock option activity is not significant.
313716_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	We award restricted stock/units (the "RSA") to employees.
313716_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	RSAs vest at the end of the service period and are subject to forfeiture as well as transfer restrictions.
313716_13_ITEM8_P199_S2	During the vesting period, the RSAs are held by the Company and the recipients are entitled to exercise rights pertaining to such shares, including the right to vote such shares.
313716_13_ITEM8_P199_S3	Recipients of RSAs awarded under the 2002 Plan have non-forfeitable rights to receive cash dividends as any other common stock holders.
313716_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	The RSAs are valued based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	The total deferred compensation associated with the RSAs awarded in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P200_S2	The deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the specified service period, which ranges from three to six years for all outstanding RSAs.
313716_13_ITEM8_P201_S0	A summary of the RSA activity is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	We award performance share incentives ("PSI") to employees.

313716_13_ITEM8_P202_S2	They are earned only if the Company meets specific performance targets over the specified performance period.
313716_13_ITEM8_P202_S3	During this period, PSI recipients have no voting rights.
313716_13_ITEM8_P203_S0	When we declare dividends, such dividends are deemed to be paid to the recipients.
313716_13_ITEM8_P203_S1	We withhold and accumulate the deemed dividends until such point that the PSIs are earned.
313716_13_ITEM8_P203_S2	If the PSIs are not earned, the accrued dividends are forfeited.
313716_13_ITEM8_P204_S0	The payment of PSIs can be in cash, or in the Company's common stock, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Company.
313716_13_ITEM8_P204_S1	The PSIs were first awarded to employees in 2011.
313716_13_ITEM8_P205_S0	A summary of the PSI activity is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P206_S0	The PSIs are valued based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_13_ITEM8_P206_S1	The total deferred compensation associated with the PSIs awarded in 2012 and 2011 was $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P206_S2	The deferred compensation is being recognized into earnings based on the passage of time and achievement of performance targets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P206_S3	The performance period of the 2012 awards starts on January 1, 2013, and, as such, we did not record any 2012 expense associated with this grant.
313716_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	Balances of the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of accumulated tax effect, are as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S0	On December 20, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Usach Technologies, Inc. ("Usach"), an Illinois based manufacturer of high precision grinding machines and systems, for $18.3 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S1	The purchase price was comprised of $11.3 million in cash and an earn-out provision valued at $7.0 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S2	The earn-out is based on the future economic performance of Usach as measured against certain minimum thresholds of earnings from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization through 2015.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S3	The maximum contractual earn-out is $7.5 million.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S4	The contingent liability associated with the earn-out is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S5	The results of operations of Usach have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S6	We expensed acquisition related costs of $0.3 million in 2012 and recorded it in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P208_S7	The acquisition of Usach is not considered significant to the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	The purchase price has been assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values.
313716_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	The identifiable intangible assets acquired, which primarily consist of customer relationships, trade name and technical know-how, were valued using an income approach.
313716_13_ITEM8_P210_S1	The weighted average life of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was estimated at 16.4 years at the time of acquisition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P210_S2	The excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductable for tax purposes.
313716_13_ITEM8_P210_S3	At December 31, 2012, the purchase price allocation is preliminary pending the finalization of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
313716_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	The preliminary allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	On April 7, 2010, the Company acquired certain assets of Jones and Shipman Precision Limited, a UK based manufacturer of grinding and super-abrasive machines and machining systems, for GBP 2.0 million ($3.2 million equivalent) and established Jones Shipman Grinding Limited ("J S"), a UK based wholly-owned subsidiary.
313716_13_ITEM8_P212_S1	The results of operations of J S have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P212_S2	We expensed acquisition related costs of $0.3 million in 2010 and recorded it in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P212_S3	The acquisition of J S is not considered significant to the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	The acquisition agreement contains provisions for a contingent purchase price payment based on sales target through March 31, 2014 with a maximum payment of GBP 0.3 million ($0.5 million equivalent).
313716_13_ITEM8_P213_S1	Based on the Company's forecasted revenue over this period, the fair value of this contingent purchase price was GBP 0.3 million ($0.5 million equivalent) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P213_S2	This contingent liability is recorded in accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	The purchase price has been assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values.
313716_13_ITEM8_P214_S1	The weighted average life of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was estimated at 6.6 years at the time of acquisition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P214_S2	The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price; accordingly, a gain of GBP 0.4 million (approximately $0.6 million) was recorded in 2010 within other expense (income) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	The allocation of purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2010 is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	Summarized quarterly financial information for 2012 and 2011 is as follows:
313716_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total earnings per share of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.
313716_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	In May 2011, Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
313716_13_ITEM8_P218_S1	This pronouncement changes certain fair value measurement guidance and expands certain disclosure requirements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P218_S2	We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to present items of net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P220_S1	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder's equity.
313716_13_ITEM8_P220_S2	We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P220_S3	Except for the new presentation requirement, the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer the changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
313716_13_ITEM8_P221_S1	This is to allow the FASB time to consider whether such adjustments should be presented on the face of the financial statements for all periods presented.
313716_13_ITEM8_P221_S2	We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to report, in one place, information about reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
313716_13_ITEM8_P223_S1	We will adopt this pronouncement on January 1, 2013.
313716_13_ITEM8_P224_S0	pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P225_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of netting assets and liabilities as a single amount in the balance sheet.
313716_13_ITEM8_P225_S1	This pronouncement amends and expands current disclosure requirements on offsetting and requires companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements.
313716_13_ITEM8_P225_S2	This pronouncement is effective for our fiscal year that begins January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively.
313716_13_ITEM8_P225_S3	We do not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P226_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued amendment to its guidance on testing indefinitely-lived intangible assets for impairment.
313716_13_ITEM8_P226_S1	This pronouncement provides an option for companies to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions are met.
313716_13_ITEM8_P226_S2	This pronouncement is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
313716_13_ITEM8_P226_S3	We adopted this pronouncement in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P226_S4	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
313716_13_ITEM8_P227_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance relating to testing goodwill for impairment.
313716_13_ITEM8_P227_S1	The amendments provide the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
313716_13_ITEM8_P227_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
313716_13_ITEM8_P227_S3	We adopted this pronouncement in 2012.
313716_13_ITEM8_P227_S4	The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

313716_13_ITEM15_P580_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Hardinge Inc. (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), I, Richard L. Simons, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and I, Edward J. Gaio, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to the best of our knowledge:
313716_13_ITEM15_P581_S0	(1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

313716_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness as of December 31, 2013 of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based upon this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2013 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Hardinge Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
313716_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
313716_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Forkardt businesses that was acquired in 2013, which is included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements and constituted $31.1 million of total assets as of December 31, 2013, and $21.7 million of sales for the year then ended.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as a result of a material weakness related to the computation of the Company's gain from the sale of the Forkardt Swiss operations in December, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Specifically, we did not have effective internal control over the financial statement close process as it relates to accounting for certain complex, non-routine transactions.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Subsequent to December 31, 2013, we have taken steps to remediate the material weakness described above.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Company's financial statements, we have established policies and procedures requiring management to retain third party subject matter expert consultants to assist in preparation of the accounting and reporting for such transactions.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
313716_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_14_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P10_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P13_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Forkardt businesses, which are included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and constituted $31.1 million of total assets as of December 31, 2013, and $21.7 million of sales for the year then ended.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Forkardt businesses.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P14_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P14_S1	The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the company's financial statement close process as it relates to the accounting for certain complex, non-routine transactions.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P16_S0	also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P16_S1	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2013 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 13, 2014, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
313716_14_ITEM9A_P17_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
313716_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	Certain information required by this item such as: the identity of the Board of Directors and, those directors determined by the Board to be independent; the members of the Audit Committee, all of whom have been determined by the Board to be independent; the Audit Committee member determined by the Board to be the financial expert; and the Shareholders Nominating Procedures are all incorporated by reference from the Registrant's proxy statement to be filed with the Commission on or about March 27, 2014.

313716_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We are a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of machine tools, specializing in precision computer numerically controlled metalcutting machines and workholding technology solutions.
313716_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company has the following direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries:
313716_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	In connection with the acquisition of the Forkardt business ("Forkardt") in 2013, the Company has realigned the manner in which financial results are monitored and decisions are made, creating two unique business segments; Metalcutting Machine Solutions (MMS) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories (ATA).
313716_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately sixty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around $1.5 million for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as our customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool than other available metalcutting technologies.
313716_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, and Jones Shipman grinding brands.
313716_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed, and cylindrical) machines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	These super-abrasive machines and machining systems are used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2012, the Company acquired Usach Technologies, Inc. ("Usach"), an Illinois-based manufacturer of custom built high precision internal and external grinding machines and systems.
313716_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The acquisition of Usach complements and enhances our grinding product portfolio.
313716_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	Products are introduced each year to both broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_14_ITEM1_P18_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes and which also may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	On many of our machines, multiple options are available which allow customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Certain parts on machines wear out, fail, or need to be replaced due to misuse over time.
313716_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to twenty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks.
313716_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	These products, while considered to be consumable are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time.
313716_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have been a supplier of Aftermarket Tooling Accessories and Solutions (ATA) since our inception.
313716_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks.
313716_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	In May of 2013, the Company acquired Forkardt, a global provider of specialty chucks.
313716_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Forkardt is based in Traverse City, Michigan with operations in the United States and Europe that provide unique solutions for demanding workholding applications.
313716_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	This acquisition positions Hardinge as one of the largest manufacturers of these types of workholding solutions in the world.
313716_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	In December of 2013, we divested the Forkardt Swiss operations due to potential customer conflicts.
313716_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in tens of thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs.
313716_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications.
313716_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_14_ITEM1_P33_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our standard ATA products are sold through direct telephone orders and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents.
313716_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_14_ITEM1_P34_S4	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through publication of general catalogues and other targeted catalogues, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	We have a considerable presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products and repair parts.
313716_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 6% of our consolidated sales in 2013 or 2012.
313716_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling and accessories.
313716_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	We compete with numerous vendors in each market sector we serve.
313716_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	Our cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S5	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S6	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_14_ITEM1_P41_S7	Our ATA products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	The Kellenberger grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	We produce machining centers and lathes at our facilities in Hardinge Taiwan in Nan Tou, Taiwan and Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. in Jiaxing, China.
313716_14_ITEM1_P43_S6	The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, NY, Kirchentellinsfurt, Germany, and Noisy le Sec, France plants.
313716_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_14_ITEM1_P44_S4	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_14_ITEM1_P45_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $12.5 million, $12.3 million and $12.7 million, in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	In those cases the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the multiple countries in which we conduct business.
313716_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	The PRPs are currently working with the EPA to finalize the Feasibility Study.
313716_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond as of December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2013, Hardinge Inc. employed 1,445 persons, 485 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Footnote 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A Risk Factors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by the recent global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Recent global economic and financial difficulties across the world are well documented.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Recently, governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. intervened in an effort to improve conditions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis, but also created instability, uncertainty and doubt.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	During this period, many of our customers experienced uncertain cash flows and reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which made commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	While global conditions appear to have improved, similar conditions in the future could negatively impact our operating results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Fluctuations in capacity at both OEMs and job shops; The availability of skilled machinists; The need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life; The need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way; The evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances; Our customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes; General economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We could incur costs due to conflict mineral regulations, which may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules regarding disclosure of the use of conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This requirement could affect the sourcing of materials used in our products as well as the companies we use to manufacture components, assembles and subassemblies for our products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In circumstances where conflict minerals in our products are found to be sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries, we may take actions to change materials to reduce the possibility that our purchase of conflict minerals may fund armed groups in the region.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	These actions could add costs to the manufacture of our products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our reputation may also suffer if we have included conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries in our products, and those conflict minerals funded armed groups in the region.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In 2013, approximately 67% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A prolonged world-wide economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our principal international markets including Asia and Europe; Changes in political, regulatory, legal, or economic conditions; Restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas, customs duties and tariffs, or trade barriers erected by either the United States or other countries where we do business; Disruptions of capital and trading markets; Changes in import or export licensing requirements; Transportation delays; Civil disturbances or political instability; Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war; Currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; Changes in labor standards; Limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property; Nationalization and expropriation; Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws; Difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and Major health concerns.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Moreover, international conflicts are creating many economic and political uncertainties that are affecting the global economy.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Escalation of existing international conflicts or the occurrence of new international conflicts could severely affect our operations and demand for our products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and anti-corruption regulations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries, and could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not violate our policies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may face trade barriers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a loss of customers or suppliers.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Trade barriers established by the U.S. or other countries may interfere with our ability to offer our products in those markets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot predict whether the U.S. or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	spending on marketing or product development, withdraw or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions adverse to us.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, our subsidiaries may require future equity-related financing, and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Those approvals may be required from the investment commissions or similar agencies of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local entities.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment and foreign trade, which may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Acquisitions may also cause us to:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership; Increase our level of indebtedness; Assume liabilities; Record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and Become subject to litigation.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions, if any, will be successful and will not have material adverse affect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Additionally, we may incur significant expenses related to potential acquisitions that are not completed.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products, technologies, facilities, and personnel to an inability to do so.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing facilities on acceptable terms; A deterioration in our financial condition that would violate current loan agreement covenants or prohibit us from obtaining additional capital from banks, financial institutions, or investors; Extreme volatility in credit markets that increase margin or credit requirements; and Volatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euros ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD"), and Swiss Francs ("CHF").
313716_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar ("USD").
313716_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, our purchases of components in CNY, EUR, TWD, CHF, and Japanese Yen ("JPY") are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We prepare our financial statements in U.S. Dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Foreign exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our revenues, costs, and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Though we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, and utilize currency exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, changes in exchange rates nonetheless cannot always be predicted or hedged.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Consequently, we cannot assure that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on customer delivery requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	With some individual machines priced in excess of $1.5 million and several machines frequently sold together as a package, a request by a customer to delay shipment at quarter end could significantly affect our quarterly results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of the plant shut-downs of one to two weeks in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday, our first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income may be the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income, and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the value of our pension plan assets for our domestic and foreign plans increased by $16.7 million primarily due to the strong investment performance.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The investment performance of our pension plan assets could significantly impact the growth of those assets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	For our domestic and major foreign plans, discount rates are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Discount rates are used to determine the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	An increase to the discount rate would generally reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would generally increase the pension liability and the future pension expense.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and major foreign plans, we consider the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	For our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, which is the largest of our plans, the rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense was 7.75% for 2013 and for 2012.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 5.24% at December 31, 2013 compared to 4.31% at December 31, 2012.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have two defined benefit plans associated with our Swiss subsidiary.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	When viewed in aggregate, these two plans constitute the second largest of our defined benefit plans.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The rate of return assumed on the market-related value of plan assets for determining pension expense was 3.50% for 2013 and 3.70% for 2012.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The discount rate used for determining the obligation was 2.40% at December 31, 2013 compared to 2.00% at December 31, 2012.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	During 2012, Congress enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act ("MAP-21").
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In the short-term, MAP-21 will increase the discount rates used to determine the funding liabilities for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, resulting in significantly lower pension contributions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	As a result of MAP-21 and based on assumptions pertaining to asset returns and corporate bond yields, we do not expect to make cash contributions of to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2014.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We do expect to make a contribution of approximately $0.2 million to our U.S. supplemental pension plan in 2014.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We also expect to make contributions of approximately $2.6 million to the foreign plans in 2014.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P58_S5	If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in years beyond 2013 may be more or less than the projected 2014 contributions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	At December 31, 2013, the excess of consolidated projected benefit obligations over plan assets was $26.9 million, when only taking into consideration plans whose projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets, and the excess of consolidated accumulated benefit obligations over plan assets was $26.5 million, when only taking into consideration plans whose accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is currently underfunded and we will be required to make cash payments to the plan, reducing the cash available for our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We record a liability associated with our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan equal to the excess of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The liability recorded at December 31, 2013 was $18.9 million.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	As a result of the enactment of MAP-21, we do not expect to contribute to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2014.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Contribution levels are largely contingent on asset returns and corporate bond yields.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If the performance of the assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan does not meet our expectations and/or corporate bond yields decrease, our future contributions to the plan could increase.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan under limited circumstances.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas, which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Due to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The technologies within our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The phasing out of an old product involves both estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines as well as to satisfy future repair part needs.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If we suffer damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our factories, facilities, and distribution system are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In 2013, approximately 69% of our sales were through distributors and agents.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 6% of our consolidated sales in 2013.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P84_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Current employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Various federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and costs to terminate or layoff employees.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow:
313716_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	minimum wages; mandated health benefits; paid leaves of absence; mandatory severance payments; and employment taxes.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	The PRPs are currently working with the EPA to finalize the Feasibility Study.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond as of December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P99_S3	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P102_S2	The loss of senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to periodically furnish a report by our management regarding, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to a material weakness in our financial statement close process as it relates to the accounting for certain complex, non-routine transactions.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of eight members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P110_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	In addition, we have filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing us to offer, from time to time and at any time, up to $100.0 million of equity securities (including common or preferred shares), subject to market conditions and other factors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P115_S1	The shares sold under the controlled equity offerings are the only equity securities sold pursuant to such registration statement thus far.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock, based upon market conditions and other factors.
313716_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Under the Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. on August 9, 2013, we have sold approximately $11.6 million of shares of our common stock, as of March 12, 2014, through "at-the-market" offerings, and may offer and sell, from time to time through such offerings an additional amount of up to an aggregate offering price of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock.
313716_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:
313716_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to its operations.
313716_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	None of the litigation in which we are currently involved, individually or in the aggregate, is anticipated to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
313716_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table reflects the highest and lowest values at which our common stock traded in each quarter of the last two years.
313716_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "HDNG".

313716_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) 2013 results include a non-cash charge of $6.2 million for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
313716_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	$5.1 million was related to the impairment in the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach, and $1.1 million was related to the impairment of the Forkardt trade name as a result of the Forkardt Swiss business divestiture.
313716_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	2009 results include a non-cash charge for impairment of $1.7 million associated with certain machinery and equipment formerly utilized in the manufacture of non-critical parts in our Elmira, NY facility.
313716_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.") with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Approximately 67% of our 2013 sales were to customers outside of North America, 68% of our 2013 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 66% of our employees were outside of North America.
313716_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our machine products are considered to be capital goods and are part of what has historically been a highly cyclical industry.
313716_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our management believes that a key performance indicator is our order level as compared to industry measures of market activity levels.
313716_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	General economic growth around the world in 2013 was slower than 2012, driven by the decelerating economy in China and uncertainties surrounding European financial and fiscal conditions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	The concerns over economic situations negatively impacted our customers' decision for capital spending.
313716_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Consequently, 2013 order volumes decreased approximately $25 million from our organic business, offset by orders from the Company's newly acquired businesses.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity watched by our management include world machine tool consumption (a proxy for shipments), as reported annually by Gardner Business Media in the World Machine-Tool Output and Consumption Survey and metalcutting machine orders as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology ("AMT"), the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	World machine tool consumption data as reported by the World Machine-Tool Output and Consumption Survey showed a decrease in machine tool consumption of 9% in 2013 compared to a decrease of 2.5% in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	This report indicates that 2013 consumption in China, the world's largest market, decreased by 12% (in US dollars) after a 1% decrease in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Consumption in Germany, the world's third largest market, saw a 6% increase in consumption as measured in local currency in 2013 compared to no change in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	In the United Kingdom, machine tool consumption measured in local currency decreased by 9% in 2013 and increased by 11% in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	In the U.S., 2013 machine tool consumption decreased by 9%, as compared to a 19% increase in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	In 2013, U.S. orders for metalcutting machine tools reported by the AMT were $4.9 billion, down when compared to $5.7 billion reported in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	The AMT's statistics are reported on a voluntary basis from member companies.
313716_14_ITEM7_P3_S8	The report includes metalcutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete.
313716_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	One such measurement in the U.S. is the Purchasing Managers Index ("PMI"), as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Similar information regarding manufacturing activity levels in foreign countries is published by various economic data services in those countries.
313716_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts and service revenue account for approximately 28% of overall sales and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications.
313716_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ("sales") and net orders ("orders"), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and our bank financing arrangements.
313716_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are also subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.

313716_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	We continue to monitor our customers' financial condition in order to mitigate our accounts receivable collectability risks.
313716_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), New Taiwanese Dollar ("TWD"), and Swiss Franc ("CHF").
313716_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ("USD") at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Below is a summary of the percentage changes for the annual average rates of our functional currencies as compared to their respective USD equivalents:
313716_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The fluctuations of the foreign currency exchange rates during 2013 resulted in favorable currency translation impact of approximately $2.3 million on new orders and $2.9 million on sales, as compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The fluctuations of the foreign currency exchange rates during 2012 resulted in unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately $3.9 million on new orders and $4.8 million on sales, as compared to 2011.
313716_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following table summarizes our financial data for 2013 and 2012:

313716_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Excluding the sales from the newly acquired businesses and the favorable foreign currency impact, sales decreased by $55.7 million, or 17%, when compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	The sales reduction was primarily a result of unfavorable market conditions for capital spending on machine tools in our European and Asian markets.
313716_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The following table presents 2013 and 2012 sales by region:
313716_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The geographic mix of sales as a percentage of total sales is shown in the table below:
313716_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	North America sales increased by $25.9 million or 31% for the year 2013 compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Included in the North American results were $26.8 million of sales from the newly acquired businesses.
313716_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Excluding those sales, organic sales would have been down by $0.9 million or 1% when compared with 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	This organic sales performance had the benefit of a strong machine backlog at the end of 2012 for North American demand.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Europe sales decreased $20.9 million or 17% for the year 2013 compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Included in these sales were $10.0 million of sales from the newly acquired businesses.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	2013 sales to this region were favorably influenced by foreign currency translation of approximately $1.0 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	Exclusive of the currency impact and sales from acquisitions, Europe sales decreased by $31.9 million, or 26%, compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	The decrease is primarily attributable to continued economic uncertainty throughout most of Europe, especially for high end machine tools.
313716_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	In addition, changes made in sales channel strategies for the UK, resulted in providing discounts to a new distribution partner, while at the same time, enabling a $5.9 million reduction in selling expenses.
313716_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Asia sales decreased by $10.0 million or 8% for the year 2013 compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Sales in this region in 2013 were favorably influenced by foreign currency translation of approximately $1.9 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Sales from the newly acquired businesses contributed $11.0 million of sales.
313716_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Exclusive of the impact of the newly acquired businesses and the impact of currency, organic sales declined by $22.9 million or 18%, compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	This decline is primarily as result of a decelerating Chinese economy, in addition to the non-recurrence of $16.0 million in sales for several large specialty multi-machine orders to the consumer electronics industry in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Machine sales represented approximately 72% and 78% of sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts, and accessories made up the balance.
313716_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit was $93.2 million or 28.3% of sales in 2013, compared to $96.8 million, or 29.0% of sales in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Included in the reported gross profit was $1.9 million of inventory step-up charges related to the purchase accounting adjustments for the Usach and Forkardt acquisitions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Excluding those charges, gross profit would have been $95.1 million or 28.9%, which is down by 0.1 points compared to 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to lower volume in our machine business, which resulted in lower factory absorption offset by the increased volume in our workholding and accessories business.
313716_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expense: Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense for the year 2013 was $79.5 million, or 24.1% of sales, compared to $76.2 million, or 22.8% of sales in 2012.

313716_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Excluding those costs, the organic business reduced expenses by $8.6 million, of which $5.9 million is related to the change in our sales distribution in the UK that was previously discussed.
313716_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	Excluding the due diligence and transaction costs, SG A as a percent of sales would have been 23.5%, or 0.7 points higher than 2012 performance.
313716_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	On an adjusted basis, the increase in SG A as a percentage of sales for 2012 was primarily driven by reduced sales volume in our machine business.
313716_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	(Gain) loss on sale of assets: In 2013, we recorded a gain of $0.1 million on sale of assets.

313716_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Generally, income tax expense represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The effective tax rate in 2013 was unfavorably influenced by the previously aforementioned impairment charges that did not provide a tax benefit.
313716_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Excluding the impairment charge, the effective tax rate would have been 14.5%.
313716_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	In addition, in 2012, the Company recorded a $2.7 million reduction of valuation allowances required on certain deferred tax assets as a result of the acquisition of Usach.
313716_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We continually assess all available positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740 to evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable.

313716_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	If market interest rates on debt subject to floating interest rates were to have increased by 2% over the actual rates paid in that year, interest expense would have increased by $0.6 million in 2013 and $0.5 million in 2012.
313716_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's outstanding borrowings.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	We currently manufacture our products in China, France, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States using production components purchased internationally, and we sell our products in those markets as well as other worldwide markets.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	Our subsidiaries in China, France, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom sell products in local currency to customers in those countries.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S3	These subsidiaries also transact business in currencies other than their functional currency outside of their home country.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S4	As a result of these sales in various currencies and in various countries of the world, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S5	Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, TWD, CNY and JPY.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S6	As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we are exposed to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on our cash flows, earnings and balance sheet.
313716_14_ITEM7_P114_S7	To mitigate this currency risk, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non-functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year.
313716_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies, which were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	Changes in metalcutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_14_ITEM7_P121_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_14_ITEM7_P121_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the Company.
313716_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_14_ITEM7_P123_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	We have acquired other machine tool companies and, in certain instances, the assets of machine tool companies.
313716_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	When doing so, we have estimated the fair value of the assets acquired, and have used traditional models for establishing purchase price based on EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples and present value of future cash flows.
313716_14_ITEM7_P124_S2	Consequently, the value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet has been affected by the use of numerous estimates of the value of assets purchased and of future business opportunity.
313716_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when indictors of impairment are present.
313716_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Footnote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
313716_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P128_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_14_ITEM7_P130_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using a rate of 5.24% and 4.31% at our plan measurement date of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM7_P130_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in a blended rate of 2.75% and 2.34% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $13.2 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P131_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $11.0 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $14.3 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $12.3 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have an effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by less than $0.1 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P133_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P133_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.2 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P133_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_14_ITEM7_P134_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_14_ITEM7_P134_S2	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_14_ITEM7_P134_S3	For our domestic plans, the expected rate of return during fiscal 2014 is 7.50%, lower by 0.25% from the 7.75% rate used for fiscal 2013.
313716_14_ITEM7_P134_S4	For our foreign plans, we used rates of return appropriate for each country which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 3.91% for both fiscal 2014 and for fiscal 2013.
313716_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_14_ITEM7_P135_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P135_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P135_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P135_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	Refer to Footnote 19 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt.
313716_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_14_ITEM7_P137_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions.
313716_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_14_ITEM7_P138_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company's ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.

313716_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Market Risk" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, of this Form 10-K.
313716_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
313716_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated March 13, 2014 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

313716_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge", "we", "us" or "the Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures and other industrial products.
313716_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	We sell our products to customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
313716_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	A substantial portion of our sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Occasionally, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits or foreign exchange forward contracts.
313716_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Additionally, restricted cash includes amounts due under mandatory principal reduction provisions associated with certain term debt agreements.
313716_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the amount of restricted cash was approximately $4.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	We perform periodic credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers.
313716_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base.
313716_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	trade accounts receivable to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
313716_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.2 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	We also review the carrying value of our inventory compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying value accordingly.
313716_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	If future demand for our products is less favorable than our forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line and accelerated methods, generally over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
313716_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or when events indicate that an impairment could exist.
313716_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
313716_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Our reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by assessing a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
313716_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
313716_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
313716_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, we determine the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using the income approach and market approach.
313716_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to the second step of the analysis to determine the amount of the impairment.
313716_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment using an income approach if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
313716_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	An impairment charge is recognized for such excess.
313716_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
313716_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as our stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
313716_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, we use undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Accrued Expenses include $15.3 million and $16.6 million in compensation related expenses at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.
313716_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P40_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	We also maintain a valuation allowance on our U.K., German, Dutch, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.

313716_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	In 2012, the valuation allowance decreased by $5.0 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	$2.7 million of the decrease is due to changes in the Company's existing U.S. valuation allowance as a result of its acquisition of Usach. which resulted in an income tax benefit.

313716_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	If recognized, essentially all of the uncertain tax positions and related interest at December 31, 2013 would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	It is reasonably possible that certain of our uncertain tax positions pertaining to our foreign operations may change within the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	We estimate the change in uncertain tax positions for these items to be a benefit to income tax expense between $0.4 million and $1.1 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

313716_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	The Company operates through segments for which separate financial information is available, and for which operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
313716_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	In 2013, the Company changed its reportable business segment from one reportable segment to two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions (MMS) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories (ATA).

313716_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company has two reportable business segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories which are described below:
313716_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately sixty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around $1.5 million for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_14_ITEM8_P153_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_14_ITEM8_P153_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as our customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	We engineer and sell high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	Turning Machines or lathes are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_14_ITEM8_P155_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P155_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_14_ITEM8_P155_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_14_ITEM8_P156_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_14_ITEM8_P156_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_14_ITEM8_P156_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	Grinding machines are used in a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_14_ITEM8_P157_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_14_ITEM8_P157_S2	Our Kellenberger and Usach grinding machines are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_14_ITEM8_P157_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	Our Hauser jig grinding machines are used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	Our Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high quality grinders (surface, creepfeed, and cylindrical) machines used by a wide range of industries.
313716_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	The prices of units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to twenty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks, and they typically are considered to be a fairly consumable, but durable, product.
313716_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	The two primary product groups are collets and chucks.
313716_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	We measure segment income for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
313716_14_ITEM8_P168_S1	Corporate expenses consist primarily of executive employment costs, certain professional fees, and costs associated with our global headquarters.
313716_14_ITEM8_P168_S2	Financial results of our reportable segments are as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	(1) Segment assets primarily consist of restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid and other assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P169_S1	Unallocated assets primarily include, cash and cash equivalents, corporate property, plant and equipment, deferred income taxes, and other non-current assets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	A reconciliation of segment income to consolidated income from operations before taxes follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	A reconciliation of segment assets to consolidated total assets follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	Unallocated assets include cash of $34.7 million, $26.9 million and $21.7 million for December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	We have no single customer who accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
313716_14_ITEM8_P173_S1	We sell our products throughout the world and we attribute sales to countries based on the country where our products are shipped to.
313716_14_ITEM8_P173_S2	Information concerning our principal geographic areas is follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	We provide a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all eligible domestic employees hired before March 1, 2004.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	The plan bases benefits upon both years of service and earnings through June 15, 2009.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S2	Our policy is to fund at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of ERISA.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S3	For our foreign plans, contributions are made on a monthly basis and are governed by their governmental regulations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S4	Each foreign plan requires employer contributions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S5	Additionally, one of our Swiss plans requires employee contributions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P174_S6	In 2010, we permanently froze the accrual of benefits under the domestic plan and one of our foreign plans.
313716_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	Domestic employees hired on or after March 1, 2004 have retirement benefits under our 401(k) defined contribution plan.
313716_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	After the completion of one year of service, we will contribute 4% of an employee's pay and will further match 25% of the first 4% that the employee contributes.
313716_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	$1.4 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	In conjunction with the permanent freeze of benefit accruals under the domestic defined benefit pension plan, employees that were actively participating in the domestic defined benefit pension plan became eligible to receive company contributions in the 401(k) plan.
313716_14_ITEM8_P177_S1	Additionally, upon reaching age 50, employees who were age 40 or older as of January 1, 2011 and were participants in the domestic defined benefit pension plan are provided enhanced employer contributions in the 401(k) plan to compensate for the loss of future benefit accruals under the defined benefit pension plan.
313716_14_ITEM8_P177_S2	We recognized $1.8 million and $1.6 million of expense for the domestic defined contribution plan in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P177_S3	Employees may contribute additional funds to the plan for which there is no required company match.
313716_14_ITEM8_P177_S4	All employer and employee contributions are invested at the direction of the employees in a number of investment alternatives, one being Hardinge Inc. common stock.
313716_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	In 2013, as a result of significant lump sum payments made in two of our foreign plans, we recognized a $0.2 million settlement charge which is reflected in the net periodic benefit cost.
313716_14_ITEM8_P178_S1	In 2012, we recognized a $3.2 million prior service credit in two of our foreign pension plans as a result of a plan amendment that changed the interest rates used to convert lump sums to annuity payments.
313716_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	As a result of our acquisition of the Forkardt operations from Illinois Tool Works in May 2013, we have assumed the benefit obligations of their defined benefit and postretirement medical plans.
313716_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	These obligations included a Termination Indemnity Plan in France and a Postretirement Medical Plan in the US.
313716_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	We provide a contributory retiree health plan covering all eligible domestic employees who retired at normal retirement age prior to January 1, 1993 and all retirees who have or will retire at normal retirement age after January 1, 1993 with at least 10 years of active service.
313716_14_ITEM8_P180_S1	Employees who elect early retirement on or after reaching age 55 are eligible for the plan benefits if they have 15 years of active service at retirement.
313716_14_ITEM8_P180_S2	Benefit obligations and funding policies are at the discretion of management.
313716_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	Increases in the cost of the retiree health plan are paid by the participants.
313716_14_ITEM8_P181_S1	We also provide a non-contributory life insurance plan to retirees who meet the same eligibility criteria as required for retiree health insurance.
313716_14_ITEM8_P181_S2	Because the amount of liability relative to this plan is insignificant, it is combined with the health plan for purposes of this disclosure.
313716_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	The discount rate for determining benefit obligations in the postretirement benefits plans was 5.13% and 4.21% at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P182_S1	The change in the discount rate decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 by $0.2 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	A summary of the pension and postretirement benefits plans' funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	The projected benefit obligations for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above were $106.7 million and $104.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	The plan assets for the foreign pension plans included above were $105.8 million and $94.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	The accumulated benefit obligations for the foreign and domestic pension plans were $212.2 million and $218.6 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets:
313716_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	The following information is presented for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets:
313716_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	A summary of the components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company is presented below.
313716_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	The pension cost includes an executive supplemental pension plan.
313716_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	A summary of the changes in pension and postretirement benefits recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss is presented below:
313716_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	The net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans included in the amounts above was $1.4 million, $1.9 million, and $1.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	We expect to recognize $1.7 million of net loss, $0.3 million of net transition assets and $0.4 million of net prior service credit as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2014 for our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	We expect to recognize $0.1 million of net gain as a component of net periodic benefit cost for our postretirement benefits plans in 2014.
313716_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include:
313716_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations include:
313716_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	For our domestic and foreign plans (except for the Taiwan plan), discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	The discount rate for the Taiwan plan is based on the yield on long-dated government bonds plus a spread.
313716_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for our domestic and foreign plans, we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_14_ITEM8_P196_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	For the qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan, the plan targets an asset allocation of approximately 55% equity securities, 36% debt securities and 9% other.
313716_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	For the foreign defined benefit pension plans, the plans target blended asset allocation of 37% equity securities, 45% debt securities and 18% other.
313716_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	Given the relatively long horizon of our aggregate obligation, our investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of our domestic and foreign plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility.
313716_14_ITEM8_P198_S1	We manage this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P198_S2	In addition, we ensure that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	Our domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.
313716_14_ITEM8_P199_S1	The selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of management, investment committees, plan trustees and their advisors.
313716_14_ITEM8_P199_S2	The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written investment management agreements, related policy guidelines and applicable governmental regulations regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.
313716_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute to our defined benefit pension plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding.
313716_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	The qualified domestic plan is the largest of all our defined benefit pension plans.
313716_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	No contributions were made to this plan for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $5.3 million was contributed for the year ended December 31, 2012.
313716_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	During 2012, Congress enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act ("MAP-21").
313716_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	In the short-term, MAP-21 will increase the discount rates used to determine funding liabilities for our domestic defined benefit pension plan, resulting in significantly lower pension contributions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	As a result of MAP-21, minimal contributions are expected to be made to our domestic defined benefit pension plan during the year ending December 31, 2014.
313716_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	We also provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans for our foreign subsidiaries.
313716_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	Each of our foreign defined benefit pension plans requires employer contributions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	Additionally, one of our Switzerland plans requires employee contributions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	The expected Company contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2014 to the foreign defined benefit pension plans are $2.6 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
313716_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	We also have employees in certain foreign countries that are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and other employee benefit plans.
313716_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	Related obligations and costs charged to operations for these plans are not material.
313716_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	The foreign entities with defined benefit pension plans are included in the consolidated pension plans described earlier within this footnote.
313716_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
313716_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_14_ITEM8_P206_S2	We are using the following fair value hierarchy definition:
313716_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	Level 3 Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis:
313716_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are based on the fair values of identical assets in active markets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P211_S1	Due to the short period to maturity or the nature of the underlying liability, the fair value of notes payable to bank and variable interest rate debt approximates their respective carrying amounts.
313716_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	The contingent purchase price payment in 2013 represents the contingent liabilities associated with the earn-out provisions from the 2012 acquisition of Usach.
313716_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	The contingent purchase price payment in 2012 represents the contingent liabilities associated with the earn-out provisions from the 2012 acquisition of Usach and 2010 acquisition of Jones Shipman.
313716_14_ITEM8_P212_S2	The fair value of the contingent purchase price payment is based on the present value of the estimated aggregated payment amount.
313716_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_14_ITEM8_P214_S0	ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments to be active.
313716_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, there were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2.
313716_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	As described in Footnote 2, the Company completed acquisitions in 2013 and 2012.
313716_14_ITEM8_P216_S0	The fair value measurements for the acquired intangible assets were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon significant unobservable Level 3 inputs which include the following:
313716_14_ITEM8_P217_S0	The following table presents the fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of the foreign currency forward contracts:
313716_14_ITEM8_P218_S0	The Company applied fair value principles during the goodwill impairment tests performed during 2013.
313716_14_ITEM8_P218_S1	Step one of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value for each of the Company's reporting units.
313716_14_ITEM8_P218_S2	The fair value for the Company's reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 or Level 2 inputs that are observable or available from active markets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P218_S3	Therefore, the Company used valuation models to estimate the fair values of its reporting units, which use Level 3 inputs.
313716_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	To estimate the fair values of reporting units, the Company uses significant estimates and judgmental factors.
313716_14_ITEM8_P219_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the valuation models include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, WACC, and earnings multiples.
313716_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	As a result of the goodwill impairment test performed during 2013, the Company recognized goodwill impairment charges (See Footnote 5 for the results of the Company's goodwill impairment tests).
313716_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	During 2013, the Company also recognized impairments to intangible assets associated with trade names.
313716_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	The impairment charges were calculated by determining the fair value of these assets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	The fair value measurements were calculated using discounted cash flow analyses which rely upon unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs.
313716_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	based on internal forecasts, royalty rates and discounts rates (See Footnote 5 for more disclosure regarding the impairment of intangible assets).
313716_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	The fair values and classification of our defined benefit plan assets is as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S0	(1) Growth funds represent a type of fund containing a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities with a goal of capital appreciation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S1	(2) Income funds represent a type of fund with an emphasis on current income as opposed to capital appreciation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S2	Such funds may contain a variety of domestic and international government and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments and dividend-paying stocks.
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S3	(3) Growth and Income funds represent a type of fund containing a combination of growth and income securities.
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S4	(4) Hedge funds represent a managed portfolio of investments that use advanced investment strategies such as leveraged, long, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.
313716_14_ITEM8_P224_S5	These funds are subject to quarterly redemptions and advanced notification requirements, as well as the right to delay redemption until sufficient fund liquidity exists.
313716_14_ITEM8_P225_S0	A summary of the changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans assets classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P226_S0	Most of our defined benefit pension plan's Level 1 assets are debt and equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally.
313716_14_ITEM8_P226_S1	They are measured at fair value using closing prices from active markets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Level 2 assets are typically investments in pooled funds, which are measured based on the value of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
313716_14_ITEM8_P227_S1	The fair value of our Level 3 plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
313716_14_ITEM8_P228_S0	We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as well as on forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiary with the exposure.
313716_14_ITEM8_P228_S1	Generally these contracts have a term of less than one year and are considered derivative instruments.
313716_14_ITEM8_P228_S2	The valuations of these derivatives are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates, and are recorded as either assets or liabilities.
313716_14_ITEM8_P229_S0	We use a group of highly rated domestic and international banks in order to mitigate counterparty risk on our forward contracts.
313716_14_ITEM8_P230_S0	For contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on the contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") into earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
313716_14_ITEM8_P231_S0	We affect the sales line where the underlying exposure is a sales order and cost of sales line where the underlying exposure is a purchase order.
313716_14_ITEM8_P231_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we expect an immaterial amount of the unrealized gain or loss on these contracts to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings over the next 12 months.
313716_14_ITEM8_P231_S2	During 2013, we reclassified an immaterial amount from AOCI to the Consolidated Statements of Operations to sales and cost of goods sold, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P231_S3	During 2012, we reclassified $0.2 million and $0.7 million from AOCI to the Consolidated Statement of Operations as an increase in sales and cost of goods sold, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P231_S4	The amount reclassified from AOCI to sales and cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2011, was not material.
313716_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	For contracts that are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current earnings as other (income) expense.
313716_14_ITEM8_P233_S0	Notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments not qualifying or designated as hedges were $45.5 million at December 31, 2013 and $60.5 million at December 31, 2012.
313716_14_ITEM8_P233_S1	The net loss realized related to this type of derivative financial instruments was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2012.
313716_14_ITEM8_P233_S2	We realized losses of $1.9 million related to this type of derivative financial instruments in 2011.
313716_14_ITEM8_P233_S3	The gains and losses were recorded in other expense (income) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P234_S0	Derivative financial instruments qualifying and designated as hedges are as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits as a result of normal operations and in the ordinary course of business.
313716_14_ITEM8_P235_S1	Management believes the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
313716_14_ITEM8_P236_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_14_ITEM8_P236_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liabilities for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_14_ITEM8_P237_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_14_ITEM8_P238_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_14_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_14_ITEM8_P240_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_14_ITEM8_P240_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM8_P240_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_14_ITEM8_P241_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_14_ITEM8_P241_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_14_ITEM8_P242_S0	not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_14_ITEM8_P243_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_14_ITEM8_P244_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., the PRPs, have agreed to voluntarily participate in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_14_ITEM8_P244_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_14_ITEM8_P244_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_14_ITEM8_P245_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_14_ITEM8_P245_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study.
313716_14_ITEM8_P246_S0	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P246_S1	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million.
313716_14_ITEM8_P246_S2	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond as of December 31, 2013.
313716_14_ITEM8_P246_S3	This reserve is reported as an accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_14_ITEM8_P247_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_14_ITEM8_P247_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_14_ITEM8_P248_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 10 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_14_ITEM8_P248_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $3.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.5 million, during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
313716_14_ITEM8_P249_S0	At December 31, 2013, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
313716_14_ITEM8_P250_S0	The Company has entered into written employment contracts with its executive officers.
313716_14_ITEM8_P250_S1	The current effective term of the employment agreements is one year and the agreements contain an automatic, successive one-year extension unless either party provides the other with 60 days prior notice of termination.
313716_14_ITEM8_P250_S2	In the case of a change in control, as defined in the employment contracts, the term of each officer's employment will be automatically extended for a period of two years following the date of the change in control.
313716_14_ITEM8_P250_S3	These employment contracts also provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment, the amount of which is increased upon certain termination events to the extent such events occur within a twelve month period following a change in control.

313716_14_ITEM8_P251_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were 20,000,000 shares of common stock authorized.

313716_14_ITEM8_P252_S1	Under the Agreement, the Agent may sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an "at-the-market" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, on any other existing trading market for the common stock or to or through a market maker.
313716_14_ITEM8_P252_S2	In addition, with the prior consent of the Company, the Agent may sell the Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions.
313716_14_ITEM8_P253_S0	The Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) sale of the Shares under the Agreement having an aggregate offering price of $25.0 million and (ii) the termination of the Agreement as permitted therein.
313716_14_ITEM8_P253_S1	The Agreement may be terminated by the Agent or the Company at any time upon 10 days notice to the other party, or by the Agent at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Company.

313716_14_ITEM8_P258_S0	Shares of certain stock-based awards totaling 52,125, 145,262, and 161,299 were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.
313716_14_ITEM8_P259_S0	On May 3, 2011, our shareholders approved the 2011 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan").
313716_14_ITEM8_P259_S1	The Plan's purpose is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders by attracting, retaining, and motivating officers and other key employees who make important contributions to the success of the Company.
313716_14_ITEM8_P259_S2	The Plan reserves 750,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the "Authorized Plan Amount") to be issued for grants of several different types of incentives including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock incentives, and performance share incentives.
313716_14_ITEM8_P259_S3	Any shares of Common Stock granted under options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount on a one-for-one basis and any shares of Common Stock granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount as two (2) shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Common Stock subject to such award.
313716_14_ITEM8_P260_S0	Authorized and issued shares of Common Stock or previously issued shares of Common Stock purchased by the Company for purposes of the Plan may be issued under the Plan.
313716_14_ITEM8_P261_S0	All of our stock-based compensation to employees is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the fair value at the grant date of the award.
313716_14_ITEM8_P261_S1	These non-cash compensation costs were included in the depreciation and amortization amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

313716_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Amsterdam, Netherlands Hardinge Machine Tools B.V.
313716_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	St. Gallen, Switzerland Asia and Other:
313716_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Hong Kong, People's Republic of China Hardinge Machine (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
313716_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, Germany, France, India, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company has two unique business segments: Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around two million dollars for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as our customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool when compared with other available metalcutting technologies.
313716_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, Jones Shipman, Usach, and Voumard grinding brands.
313716_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed, and cylindrical) machines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	These super-abrasive machines and machining systems are used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	Usach and Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems used in production and job shop environments.
313716_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Products are introduced each year to both broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_15_ITEM1_P23_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard-to-machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes that may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Multiple options are available on many of our machines, which allows customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Certain parts on machines wear out, fail, or need to be replaced due to misuse over time.
313716_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_15_ITEM1_P28_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to twenty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks.
313716_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	While considered to be consumable, these products are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time.
313716_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks.
313716_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	In May of 2013, the Company acquired Forkardt, a global provider of specialty chucks.
313716_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Forkardt is based in Traverse City, Michigan with operations in the United States, Europe, and Asia that provide unique solutions for demanding workholding applications.
313716_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	This acquisition positions Hardinge as one of the largest manufacturers of rotating workholding solutions in the world.
313716_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	In December of 2013, we divested the Forkardt Swiss operations due to potential customer conflicts.
313716_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in tens of thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs.
313716_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications.
313716_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_15_ITEM1_P38_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our standard ATA products are sold through direct telephone orders and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents.
313716_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through publication of general catalogs and other targeted catalogs, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	We have a considerable presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products and repair parts.
313716_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 6% of our consolidated sales in 2014 or 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling and accessories.
313716_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	We compete with numerous vendors in each market sector we serve.
313716_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our internal and outer diameter (ID/OD) cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S5	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S6	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_15_ITEM1_P46_S7	Our ATA products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	The Kellenberger and Voumard grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	We produce machining centers and lathes at our Hardinge Taiwan facility in Nan Tou, Taiwan and our Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. facility in Jiaxing, China.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S6	The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our plants located in Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, New York, Kirchentellinsfurt, Germany, Noisy le Sec, France, and Hyderabad, India.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S7	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S8	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S9	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S10	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_15_ITEM1_P48_S11	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, Mitsubishi Electric, a Japanese electronics company, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $13.9 million , $12.5 million and $12.3 million , in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_15_ITEM1_P55_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	In those cases, the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the various countries in which we conduct business.
313716_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRPs"), have agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the cost of the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	On September 7, 2011, the PRPs submitted the draft Remedial Investigation Report to the EPA and on January 10, 2013, the draft Feasibility Study was submitted to the EPA.
313716_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	The PRPs are preparing a revised draft feasibility study to update site information and to address issues raised by the EPA.
313716_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The draft Feasibility Study identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.7 million to $3.4 million .
313716_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	The proposed revised draft feasibility study is identifying an estimated life-cycle range from $0.9 million to $3.7 million .
313716_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	We estimate that our portion of the potential costs, based upon the proposed revised feasibility study, are estimated to range from $0.1 million to $0.5 million .
313716_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, we have recorded a reserve of $0.2 million for the Company's share of remediation expenses at the Pond as of December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM1_P69_S4	This reserve is included in " Accrued expenses " in the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
313716_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Hardinge Inc. employed 1,478 persons, 493 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 17.
313716_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	"Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
313716_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Global economic and financial difficulties across the world in recent years have been well documented.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. subsequently intervened in an effort to improve economic conditions.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis, but also created instability, uncertainty and doubt.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	During this period, many of our customers experienced uncertain cash flows and reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which made commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	While global conditions appear to have improved, similar conditions in the future could negatively impact our operating results.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In 2014 , approximately 68% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Health epidemics and other localized health risks.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and anti-corruption regulations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries, and could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not violate these policies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Acquisitions may also cause us to:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions, if any, will be successful and will not have material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Additionally, we may incur significant expenses related to potential acquisitions that are not completed.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products, technologies, facilities, and personnel to an inability to do so.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Volatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including British Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Chinese Renminbi ("CNY"), Euros ("EUR"), Indian Rupee ("INR"), New Taiwanese Dollars ("TWD"), and Swiss Francs ("CHF").
313716_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar ("USD").
313716_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, our purchases of components in CNY, EUR, TWD, CHF, and Japanese Yen ("JPY") are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We prepare our financial statements in USD in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"), but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our revenues, costs, and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Though we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, and utilize currency exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, changes in exchange rates nonetheless cannot always be predicted or hedged.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Consequently, we cannot assure that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income (loss), and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P39_S5	An increase to the discount rate would generally reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would generally increase the pension liability and the future pension expense.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Contribution levels are largely contingent on asset returns and corporate bond yields.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If the performance of the assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan does not meet our expectations and/or corporate bond yields decrease, our future contributions to the plan could increase.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities, our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas, which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Due to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The technologies incorporated in our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The phasing out of an old product involves both estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines as well as to satisfy future repair part needs.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on our customers' ability to pay.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we suffer damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our factories, facilities, and distribution system are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our business operations may be adversely affected by interruptions or failures of our technology information systems .
313716_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are dependent on multiple information technology systems throughout our company to operate our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	An interruption or failure of our information technology systems, or a cybersecurity attack, such as unauthorized access, malicious software or other intrusion, may result in a significant disruption of our business operations and materially increase our costs of operations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In 2014 , approximately 66% of our sales were through distributors and agents.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs, and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P62_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Current employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Various federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and costs to terminate or layoff employees.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow:
313716_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	"Business - Environmental Matters", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The loss of senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to periodically furnish a report by our management regarding, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014 , the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of seven members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In addition, we have filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing us to offer, from time to time and at any time, up to $100.0 million of equity securities (including common or preferred shares), subject to market conditions and other factors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The shares sold under the controlled equity offerings are the only equity securities sold pursuant to such registration statement thus far.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock, based upon market conditions and other factors.
313716_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Under a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. on August 9, 2013, we have sold approximately $14.6 million of shares of our common stock, as of December 31, 2014 , through "at-the-market" offerings, and may offer and sell, from time to time through such offerings an additional amount of up to an aggregate offering price of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock.
313716_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:
313716_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to its operations.
313716_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	None of the litigation in which we are currently involved, individually or in the aggregate, is anticipated to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
313716_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table reflects the highest and lowest values at which our common stock traded in each quarter of the last two years.
313716_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "HDNG".
313716_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The table also includes dividends per share, by quarter:
313716_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	At March 6, 2015 , there were 228 shareholders of record of our common stock.
313716_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The graph below compares the five-year cumulative total return for Hardinge Inc. common stock with the comparable returns for the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S.) Index and a group of 16 peer issuers, and our old peer group of 15 peer issuers.
313716_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	The companies included in our new peer group were selected based on comparability to Hardinge with respect to market capitalization, sales, manufactured products and international presence.
313716_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Our new peer group includes Altra Holding, Inc., Cohu, Inc., Columbus McKinnon Corporation, Dynamic Materials Corporation, Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Global Power Equipment Group Inc., Hurco Companies Inc., Kadant Inc., Nanometrics Inc., Newport Corporation, NN, Inc., PMFG, Inc., Rudolph Technologies, Inc., Sifco Industries Inc., Transcat Inc., and Twin Disc Inc.
313716_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	Our old peer group included Flow International Corporation and Zygo Corporation, both of which were acquired during 2014 and were no longer publicly traded.
313716_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	We replaced these two companies with Dynamic Materials Corporation, PMFG, Inc., and Rudolph Technologies.
313716_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Cumulative total return represents the change in stock price and the amount of dividends received during the indicated period, assuming reinvestment of dividends.

313716_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	____________________ * $100 invested on 12/31/09 in stock or index, including reinvestment of dividends.
313716_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	____________________ (1) 2014 and 2013 results include non-cash charges of $5.8 million and $6.2 million , respectively, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
313716_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	$5.8 million and $5.1 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, was related to the impairment in the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach, and $1.1 million in 2013 was related to the impairment of the Forkardt trade name as a result of the Forkardt Swiss business divestiture.
313716_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	(2) On December 31, 2013 , the Company divested its Forkardt operations in Switzerland for CHF 5.6 million , net of cash sold ( $6.3 million equivalent), resulting in a gain of $4.9 million .
313716_15_ITEM6_P1_S3	In March 2014, the Company recognized $0.2 million of additional consideration as a result of final working capital adjustments.
313716_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ( U.S. ), and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Approximately 68% of our 2014 sales were to customers outside of North America, 71% of our 2014 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 67% of our employees in 2014 were employed outside of North America.
313716_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity monitored by our management include world machine tool shipments, as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report, and metal-cutting machine orders, as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	Similar information regarding machine tool shipments and economic indicators in foreign countries is published by trade associations, government agencies, and economic services in those countries.
313716_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts and service revenue, accounted for approximately 34% of overall sales in 2014 and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications.
313716_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ( sales ) and net orders ( orders ), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, our bank financing arrangements, and equity financing arrangements.
313716_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and non-performance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We continue to monitor our customers financial condition in order to mitigate the risk associated with our ability to collect on our accounts receivable.
313716_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan, which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ( GBP ), Chinese Renminbi ( CNY ), Euro ( EUR ), New Taiwanese Dollar ( TWD ), and Swiss Franc ( CHF ).
313716_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Under US GAAP, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ( USD ) at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on sales when compared to 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Presented below is summarized selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
313716_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The table below summarizes sales by each corresponding geographical region for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
313716_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $311.6 million , a decrease of $17.8 million , or 5.4% when compared to the prior year.
313716_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The leading cause of the overall decline in sales as compared to the prior year was primarily a result of lower sales volume at Usach of $17.9 million , due to the unusually strong shipments in 2013 that resulted from the significant backlog acquired at the end of 2012, combined with an overall decline in sales of the Company's other machine solutions of $15.4 million .
313716_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	These decreases were offset in part by the full year impact of the acquisition of Forkardt, which contributed $15.3 million in incremental sales during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	North America sales were $100.9 million and $109.5 million , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , a decrease of $8.6 million , or 7.8% .
313716_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The current year decrease is driven by the reduction in Usach sales as mentioned above of $8.2 million , combined with reduced sales levels of the company s other grinding machines of $7.7 million , partially offset by the full year impact of the acquisition of Forkardt, which contributed $6.2 million in incremental sales during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Europe sales were $103.1 million and $100.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, an increase of $2.9 million , or 2.9% .

313716_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Asia sales were $107.7 million and $119.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, a decrease of $12.2 million , or 10.2% .
313716_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Usach sales of $9.7 million , combined with an overall decrease in other grinding machine sales of $1.9 million , along with an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of $1.1 million .
313716_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	The full year impact of the acquisition of Forkardt partially offset the overall decrease in sales, contributing $1.4 million in incremental sales.
313716_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Demand from customers in China is the key driver of the performance of the machine tool industry, and while recent machine tool industry data from China is reporting a current year decline in demand, Hardinge has been able to maintain sales volume levels in the primary customer segments that it serves.
313716_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Sales of machines accounted for approximately 66% of the consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to 72% in 2013 .

313716_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase in the portion of non-machine sales over total sales during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 was primarily driven by sales activity from the acquired Forkardt business.
313716_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit was $86.9 million , or 27.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to $93.2 million , or 28.3% of sales in 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decline in gross margin was primarily a result of lower production levels in the Company s grinding facilities, which resulted in lower factory absorption.
313716_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses were $81.0 million , or 26.0% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $1.5 million or 1.9% , compared to $79.5 million , or 24.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	SG A for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $4.3 million of incremental SG A expense from our Forkardt acquisition, offset in part by the impact of $2.2 million of acquisition related expenses included in prior year, $0.6 million of additional SG A from our Voumard acquisition, and $0.4 million of unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates.
313716_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations, SG A decreased by $1.6 million compared to 2013 , primarily as a result of charges recorded in 2013 related to the change in our sales distribution in the United Kingdom, for which there are no correlated charges in 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	An impairment charge to goodwill of $4.8 million and the Usach trade name of $0.9 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2014 as a result of impairment indicators being present in our Usach reporting unit.
313716_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	In 2013 , we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $5.1 million to reduce the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach.
313716_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	As a result of these charges in 2014 and 2013 , all of the goodwill related to the Usach acquisition has been written off.
313716_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the Forkardt Swiss business in 2013 , we recorded a $1.1 million non-cash charge associated with the Forkardt trade name.

313716_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The effective tax rates were (109.6)% for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to 25.9% in 2013 , which differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings by country and by the non-recognition of tax benefits for certain entities in a loss position for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.
313716_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	The effective tax rate was influenced by the previously aforementioned impairment charges.
313716_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We continually assess all available positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740 to evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable.
313716_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	To the extent that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in a particular jurisdiction will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.

313716_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Included in the North American results were $26.8 million of sales from the newly acquired businesses.
313716_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	Excluding those sales, organic sales would have been down by $0.9 million or 1% when compared with 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	This organic sales performance had the benefit of a strong machine backlog at the end of 2012 for North American demand.
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Europe sales decreased $20.9 million or 17% for the year 2013 compared to 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Included in these sales were $10.0 million of sales from the newly acquired businesses.
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	2013 sales to this region were favorably influenced by foreign currency translation of approximately $1.0 million .
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Exclusive of the currency impact and sales from acquisitions, Europe sales decreased by $31.9 million , or 26%, compared to 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	The decrease is primarily attributable to continued economic uncertainty throughout most of Europe, especially for high end machine tools.
313716_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	In addition, changes made in sales channel strategies for the UK, resulted in providing discounts to a new distribution partner, while at the same time, enabling a $5.9 million reduction in selling expenses.
313716_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Asia sales decreased by $10.0 million or 8% for the year 2013 compared to 2012 .

313716_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Exclusive of the impact of the newly acquired businesses and the impact of currency, organic sales declined by $22.9 million or 18%, compared to 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	This decline is primarily as result of a decelerating Chinese economy, in addition to the non-recurrence of $16.0 million in sales for several large specialty multi-machine orders to the consumer electronics industry in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Machine sales represented approximately 72% and 78% of sales in 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Sales of non-machine products and services, primarily workholding, repair parts, and accessories made up the balance.
313716_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross profit was $93.2 million or 28.3% of sales in 2013 , compared to $96.8 million , or 29.0% of sales in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Included in the reported gross profit was $1.9 million of inventory step-up charges related to the purchase accounting adjustments for the Usach and Forkardt acquisitions.
313716_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Excluding those charges, gross profit would have been $95.1 million or 28.9%, which is down by 0.1 points compared to 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to lower volume in our machine business, which resulted in lower factory absorption offset by the increased volume in our workholding and accessories business.
313716_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense for the year 2013 was $79.5 million , or 24.1% of sales, compared to $76.2 million , or 22.8% of sales in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The 2013 increase in SG A included expenses associated with the newly acquired businesses of $9.7 million in addition to $2.2 million associated with due diligence and transaction costs for the Forkardt acquisition.
313716_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	Excluding those costs, the organic business reduced expenses by $8.6 million, of which $5.9 million is related to the change in our sales distribution in the UK that was previously discussed.
313716_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	Excluding the due diligence and transaction costs, SG A as a percent of sales would have been 23.5%, or 0.7 points higher than 2012 performance.
313716_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	On an adjusted basis, the increase in SG A as a percentage of sales for 2012 was primarily driven by reduced sales volume in our machine business.
313716_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	As part of the company's review of goodwill and other intangible assets under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $5.1 million reducing the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach.
313716_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the company's Forkardt Swiss business, the Company recorded a $1.1 million non-cash charge associated with the Forkardt trade name.
313716_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other expense was $0.5 million in 2013 and $0.6 million in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The expense in both years is primarily related to foreign currency losses.
313716_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income from operations in 2013 was $7.0 million , compared to $20.1 million in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease in income from operations was driven by lower organic sales volume, $6.2 million in impairment charges, and $4.1 million in acquisition and inventory step up costs.
313716_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense includes interest incurred on borrowings under our credit facilities, amortization of deferred financing costs associated with these facilities and related commitment fees.
313716_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Interest expense for 2013 was $1.1 million compared to $0.9 million for 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	The increase in interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 is mainly attributable our higher average outstanding indebtedness related to the term loan associated with the Forkardt acquisition.
313716_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Income from Continuing Operations before income taxes.
313716_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Income from continuing operations before tax was $5.9 million in 2013 compared to $19.3 million in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decrease in income from continuing operations before tax was driven by lower organic sales volume, $6.2 million in impairment charges, and $4.1 million in acquisition and inventory step up costs.
313716_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income tax expense was $1.5 million in 2013 and 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The effective tax rate was 25.9% in 2013 and 7.7% in 2012 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Generally, income tax expense represents tax expense on profits in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
313716_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The effective tax rate in 2013 was unfavorably influenced by the previously aforementioned impairment charges that did not provide a tax benefit.
313716_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Excluding the impairment charge, the effective tax rate would have been 14.5%.
313716_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	In addition, in 2012 , the Company recorded a $2.7 million reduction of valuation allowances required on certain deferred tax assets as a result of the acquisition of Usach.
313716_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	Excluding the valuation allowance adjustment, the effective tax rate in 2012 would have been 21.7%.
313716_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	We continually assess all available positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740 to evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable.
313716_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	To the extent that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in a particular jurisdiction will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.

313716_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The primary driver was softer demand for machine tool consumption in Europe and North America.
313716_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	This was partially offset by $26.0 million of acquired grinding backlog from Usach in December of 2012 that was shipped to customers in 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Segment profitability in 2013 was $16.3 million , or $6.2 million below 2012 performance.
313716_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The primary factor in reduced profitability was lower demand for Swiss and Taiwanese made product which resulted lower utilization of our factories, and lower profitability.
313716_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The impact of lower utilization was partially offset by income generated by sales from the Usach acquisition.

313716_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we generated $3.2 million net cash from operating activities.
313716_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The net cash generated was driven by a net loss (as adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense and impairment loss), an increase in accounts payable due to timing of purchases and payment activity, and decreases in other assets.
313716_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	These cash inflows were offset in part by an increase in customer receivables due to the timing of sales and collection activity, a decrease in accrued expenses, primarily as a result of lower accrued commissions and bonuses as a result of lower current year sales, a decrease in customer deposits due to timing of shipments and new orders received, and an increase in inventories based on orders and associated production levels.
313716_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we generated $25.8 million net cash in operating activities.
313716_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The generation of net cash was primarily driven by a decrease in inventory levels, combined with net income, as adjusted for impairment charges and depreciation and amortization expense.
313716_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The cash inflow was offset in part by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable, primarily as a result of slowing business activities as a result of lower order levels, and a decrease in customer deposits, driven by the fulfillment of customer orders.

313716_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	In total, there were various outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.7 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 16 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $3.0 million , $3.2 million and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	The following table shows our future commitments in effect as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
313716_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.
313716_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	In 2015 , we expect to make approximately $2.4 million in contributions to our foreign defined benefit pension plans and $0.2 million contributions to our domestic supplemental retirement plans.
313716_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	We expect to make no cash contributions to our qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2015 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	We believe that the current available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2015 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we voluntarily changed the date of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing from the last day of the fiscal year to the first day of the fourth quarter.
313716_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	This voluntary change is preferable under the circumstances as it provides additional time to complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in advance of year-end reporting.
313716_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	The voluntary change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
313716_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	This change was not applied retrospectively, as doing so would require the use of significant estimates and assumptions that include hindsight.
313716_15_ITEM7_P105_S4	Accordingly, the change was applied prospectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies that were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	Changes in metalcutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_15_ITEM7_P111_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_15_ITEM7_P111_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the Company.
313716_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indicators of impairment are present.
313716_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
313716_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
313716_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
313716_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and/or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
313716_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	We have three reporting units, only one of which currently has goodwill.
313716_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Our ATA reporting unit had goodwill totaling $6.7 million as of December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
313716_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, as a result of lower than expected performance in our Usach reporting unit, combined with a downward revision in the anticipated future results, the Company determined that there were indicators of an impairment of that reporting unit.
313716_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	Accordingly, we performed an assessment of the fair value using the expected present value of future cash flows, recent industry transaction multiples and using estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believed were appropriate in the circumstances, which resulted in the carrying amount of the Usach reporting unit exceeding its fair value.
313716_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	As a result, the full carrying value of the Usach goodwill ( $4.8 million ) was written off.
313716_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Our annual goodwill impairment review was performed as of October 1, 2014.
313716_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	As a result of this assessment we determined that the fair value of our reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value.
313716_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Note 13.
313716_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	"Employee Benefits" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using a rate of 4.28% and 5.24% at our plan measurement date of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in a blended rate of 1.43% and 2.75% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $15.6 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $12.8 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P126_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $14.2 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P126_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $16.9 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have an effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by less than $0.1 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by less than $0.1 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P127_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $2.0 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P127_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.4 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_15_ITEM7_P128_S3	For our domestic plans, the expected rate of return during fiscal 2015 is 7.50%, which is the same rate used for fiscal 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P128_S4	For our foreign plans, we used rates of return appropriate for each country which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 3.95% for fiscal 2015 , compared to 3.91% for fiscal 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P129_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P129_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P129_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	We are currently assessing the financial impact to our consolidated financial statements of accounting guidance not yet adopted.
313716_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	For further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to Note 19.
313716_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	"New Accounting Standards" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this 10-K.
313716_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company s ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company s entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company s ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_15_ITEM7_P132_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Market Risk" in Item 7.
313716_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of this Form 10-K.
313716_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_15_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
313716_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated March 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
313716_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

313716_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or "the Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures and other industrial products.
313716_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	Products are sold to customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
313716_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	A substantial portion of sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_15_ITEM8_P10_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company operates through two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ( MMS ) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ( ATA ).
313716_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	The MMS segment includes high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	The ATA segment includes products, primarily collets and chucks that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their Hardinge or other branded machines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America ("US GAAP") which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Occasionally, the Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits or foreign exchange forward contracts.
313716_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Additionally, restricted cash includes amounts due under mandatory principal reduction provisions associated with certain term debt agreements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the amount of restricted cash was approximately $3.2 million and $4.1 million , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The financial condition of the Company's customers is performed periodically through credit reviews.
313716_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base.
313716_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Trade accounts receivable are considered to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
313716_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company will assess the valuation of inventory balances, and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	The net realizable value of such inventories is estimated based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	The carrying value of inventory is also compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and inventory carrying value will be adjusted accordingly.
313716_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_15_ITEM8_P22_S4	If future demand for products is less favorable than forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or when events indicate that an impairment could exist.
313716_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
313716_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company has three reporting units.
313716_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company voluntarily changed the date of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing from the last day of the fiscal year to the first day of the fourth quarter.
313716_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	This voluntary change is preferable under the circumstances as it provides the Company with additional time to complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in advance of year-end reporting.
313716_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	The voluntary change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
313716_15_ITEM8_P26_S3	This change was not applied retrospectively, as doing so would require the use of significant estimates and assumptions that include hindsight.
313716_15_ITEM8_P26_S4	Accordingly, the change was applied prospectively.
313716_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by assessing a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	If it is determined after completing this assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a step-two impairment test is performed.
313716_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
313716_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
313716_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	As part of the impairment analysis, the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill is determined using the income approach and market approach.
313716_15_ITEM8_P28_S3	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the analysis is performed to determine the amount of the impairment.
313716_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment using an income approach if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
313716_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	An impairment charge is recognized for such excess.
313716_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
313716_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company's stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
313716_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, undiscounted cash flows are used to measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Accrued expenses include $13.4 million and $15.3 million in compensation related expenses at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.
313716_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P35_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	A full valuation allowance is maintained on the tax benefits of the U.S. net deferred tax assets and it is expected that a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits will be recorded until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	A valuation allowance is also maintained on the U.K., German, Dutch, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The calculation of the tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, and India.
313716_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold in accordance with ASC 740.
313716_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
313716_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives and returns.
313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders which are not eligible for return.
313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_15_ITEM8_P40_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
313716_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Prior to shipment, each machine is tested to ensure the machine's compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in the promotional literature.
313716_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	On an exception basis, where larger multiple machine installations are delivered which require run-offs and customer acceptance at their facility, revenue is recognized in the period of customer acceptance.

313716_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	The costs that may be incurred are estimated under the basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair cost history and record a liability for such costs when that product revenue is recognized.
313716_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
313716_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Factors that affect the warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
313716_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Extended warranties for some of the Company's products are also sold.
313716_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	These extended warranties usually cover a one year to two year period that begins after the basic warranty expires.

313716_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following table presents the carrying amount, fair values, and classification level within the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):
313716_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are based on the fair values of identical assets in active markets.
313716_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Due to the short period to maturity or the nature of the underlying liability, the fair value of variable interest rate debt approximates their respective carrying amounts.
313716_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The contingent consideration represents the contingent liabilities associated with the earn-out provisions from the 2012 acquisition of Usach.
313716_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the present value of the estimated aggregated payment amount.
313716_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured using internal models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	Based on the Company s continued ability to enter into forward contracts, the markets for the fair value instruments are considered to be active.
313716_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , there were no significant transfers in and/or out of Level 1 and Level 2.

313716_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The fair value measurements for the acquired intangible assets were calculated using discounted cash flow analysis which rely upon significant unobservable Level 3 inputs which include the following:
313716_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company applied fair value principles during the goodwill impairment tests performed during 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	Step one of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value for each of the Company's reporting units.
313716_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The fair value for the Company's reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 or Level 2 inputs that are observable or available from active markets.
313716_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	Therefore, the Company used valuation models to estimate the fair values of its reporting units, which use Level 3 inputs.

313716_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	The valuation allowance decreased by $10.1 million due to operational results and a decrease in state tax credits in the U.S.
313716_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	In New York State, corporate tax reform enacted in March 2014 changed the tax rate of a qualified manufacturing company such as Hardinge to 0% .
313716_15_ITEM8_P156_S1	As a result, Hardinge determined that it was unlikely to recognize any of the $6.9 million of New York State Investment Credit carryovers, and therefore wrote off the deferred tax asset for the carryovers.
313716_15_ITEM8_P156_S2	A corresponding decrease in the valuation allowance of $6.9 million was recorded, since the deferred tax asset on the carryover had a valuation allowance against it.
313716_15_ITEM8_P156_S3	This decrease was offset by $5.6 million of valuation allowance recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

313716_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	It is reasonably possible that certain of the uncertain tax positions pertaining to the foreign operations may change within the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P164_S1	The estimated change in uncertain tax positions for these items would be a benefit to income tax expense up to $1.5 million .
313716_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations .
313716_15_ITEM8_P165_S1	Accrued interest related to the uncertain tax positions was $0.4 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

313716_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include:
313716_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	Actuarial assumptions used to determine pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations include:
313716_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	For the domestic and foreign plans (except for the Taiwan plan), discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	The discount rate for the Taiwan plan is based on the yield on long-dated government bonds plus a spread.
313716_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for the domestic and foreign plans, management considers the current level of expected returns on least risk investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_15_ITEM8_P207_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	The market-related value of assets for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which the Company believes is consistent with the long-term nature of the pension obligations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	For the qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan, the plan targets an asset allocation of approximately 55% equity securities, 36% debt securities and 9% other.
313716_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	For the foreign defined benefit pension plans, the plans target blended asset allocation of 37% equity securities, 45% debt securities and 18% other.
313716_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	Given the relatively long horizon of the aggregate obligation, the investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of the domestic and foreign plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility.
313716_15_ITEM8_P210_S1	This risk is managed primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P210_S2	In addition, the Company ensures that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	The domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.
313716_15_ITEM8_P211_S1	The selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of management, investment committees, plan trustees and their advisors.
313716_15_ITEM8_P211_S2	The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written investment management agreements, related policy guidelines and applicable governmental regulations regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.
313716_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company's funding policy is to contribute to the defined benefit pension plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding.
313716_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	The qualified domestic plan is the largest of all the Company's defined benefit pension plans.
313716_15_ITEM8_P213_S1	No contributions were made to this plan for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	During 2014, Congress enacted the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 ("HAFTA").
313716_15_ITEM8_P214_S1	In the short-term, HAFTA will increase the discount rates used to determine funding liabilities for the domestic defined benefit pension plan, resulting in significantly lower pension contributions.
313716_15_ITEM8_P214_S2	As a result of HAFTA, minimal contributions are expected to be made to the domestic defined benefit pension plan during the year ending December 31, 2015 .
313716_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company also provides defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans for the foreign subsidiaries.
313716_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	Each of the foreign defined benefit pension plans requires employer contributions.
313716_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	Additionally, one of the Switzerland plans requires employee contributions.
313716_15_ITEM8_P215_S3	The expected Company contributions to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2015 to the foreign defined benefit pension plans are $2.4 million .

313716_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_15_ITEM8_P238_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around two million dollars for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P238_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_15_ITEM8_P238_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_15_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company engineers and sells high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	Turning Machines or lathes are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_15_ITEM8_P240_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_15_ITEM8_P240_S2	On parts produced by Hardinge machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_15_ITEM8_P240_S3	Management considers Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_15_ITEM8_P241_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_15_ITEM8_P241_S3	The Company supplies a broad line of machining centers under the Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	Grinding machines are used in a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_15_ITEM8_P242_S2	The Kellenberger and Usach grinding machines are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_15_ITEM8_P242_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Hauser jig grinding machines are used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	The Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high quality grinders (surface, creepfeed, and cylindrical) machines used by a wide range of industries.
313716_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems.
313716_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P245_S1	The prices of units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to twenty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks, and they typically are considered to be a fairly consumable, but durable, product.
313716_15_ITEM8_P246_S0	The Company's products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to Hardinge Brand.
313716_15_ITEM8_P246_S1	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_15_ITEM8_P247_S0	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P248_S0	The two primary product groups are collets and chucks.
313716_15_ITEM8_P249_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P250_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_15_ITEM8_P250_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_15_ITEM8_P250_S2	Some of the specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_15_ITEM8_P251_S0	While the Company's products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_15_ITEM8_P252_S0	Segment income is measured for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.

313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S0	In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance regarding the accounting treatment of extraordinary and unusual items in the statements of operations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S1	This guidance eliminates the concept of extraordinary items.
313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S2	Although the amendments will eliminate the requirements in current guidance for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.
313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S3	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S4	A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively.
313716_15_ITEM8_P261_S5	The Company does not believe the effects of this guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
313716_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	In November 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to pushdown accounting.
313716_15_ITEM8_P262_S1	The new guidance provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.
313716_15_ITEM8_P262_S2	The amendments are effective on November 18, 2014, which is the date that the Company adopted this guidance.
313716_15_ITEM8_P263_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P264_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on management's evaluation and disclosure of uncertainties about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
313716_15_ITEM8_P264_S1	In connection with the preparation of the interim and annual financial statements, management will be required to perform an assessment of whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
313716_15_ITEM8_P264_S2	If conditions or events are identified that raise substantial doubt that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, additional disclosures are required.
313716_15_ITEM8_P264_S3	This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods thereafter.
313716_15_ITEM8_P264_S4	Management does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the financial statements or related disclosures.
313716_15_ITEM8_P265_S0	In June 2014, FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for share-based payments when the terms of the award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.
313716_15_ITEM8_P265_S1	This guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition, and as such, should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
313716_15_ITEM8_P265_S2	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
313716_15_ITEM8_P265_S3	Management does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the financial statements or related disclosures.
313716_15_ITEM8_P266_S0	In May 2014, FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for revenue recognition.
313716_15_ITEM8_P266_S1	The objective of this guidance is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S0	The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S1	In applying the new guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S2	This guidance applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S3	The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S4	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt this guidance.
313716_15_ITEM8_P267_S5	The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on the financial statements, nor decided upon the method of adoption.
313716_15_ITEM8_P268_S0	In April 2014, FASB issued authoritative guidance on the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations.
313716_15_ITEM8_P268_S1	This guidance is effective for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
313716_15_ITEM8_P268_S2	Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been previously reported in financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM8_P268_S3	Management does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014 , as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based upon this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Hardinge Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
313716_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
313716_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 , the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2013 , due to a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of the Company s gain from the sale of the Forkardt Swiss operations in December 2013.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Specifically, management review over complex, non-routine transactions that could have a significant impact on financial reporting was not operating effectively as of December 31, 2013 .
313716_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The Company has implemented new controls and procedures in the current year to address the material weakness, including engaging third-party specialists to provide additional review when significant non-routine transactions of a complex nature occur.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Testing of these remedial actions was completed as of the end of the period covered by this report and management has concluded that this material weakness has been remediated.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
313716_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	As described above, there have been changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
313716_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria.
313716_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Hong Kong, People's Republic of China Hardinge Machine (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
313716_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, Germany, France, India, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company has two unique business segments: Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some standard products to around two million dollars for specialized grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as our customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool when compared with other available metalcutting technologies.
313716_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, Jones Shipman, Usach, and Voumard grinding brands.
313716_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce the level of involvement a machine operator has to perform in the production process.
313716_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high-quality grinding (surface, creep feed, and cylindrical) machines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	These super-abrasive machines and machining systems are used by a diverse range of industries.
313716_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Usach and Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems used in production and job shop environments.
313716_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our machines are generally computer controlled and use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	Products are introduced each year to both broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_16_ITEM1_P24_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes that may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Multiple options are available on many of our machines, which allows customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Certain parts on machines wear out, fail, or need to be replaced due to misuse over time.
313716_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_16_ITEM1_P29_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to fifty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks.
313716_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	While considered to be consumable, these products are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time.
313716_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks.
313716_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating work piece.
313716_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	In May of 2013, the Company acquired Forkardt, a global provider of specialty chucks.
313716_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Forkardt is based in Traverse City, Michigan with operations in the United States, Europe, and Asia that provide unique solutions for demanding workholding applications.
313716_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	This acquisition positions Hardinge as one of the largest manufacturers of rotating workholding solutions in the world.
313716_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	In December of 2013, we divested the Forkardt Swiss operations due to potential customer conflicts.
313716_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in tens of thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs.
313716_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications.
313716_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, India, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_16_ITEM1_P39_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our standard ATA products are sold through direct telephone orders and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents.
313716_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	We promote recognition of our products in the marketplace through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through publication of general catalogs and other targeted catalogs, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	We have a considerable presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products and repair parts.
313716_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2015 or 2014 .
313716_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling and accessories.
313716_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We compete with multiple companies in each market sector we serve.
313716_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our internal and outer diameter (ID/OD) cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with Studer, a Swiss company as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S5	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S6	Our surface grinding machines compete with Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_16_ITEM1_P47_S7	Our ATA products compete with many smaller companies.
313716_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	The Kellenberger and Voumard grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	We produce machining centers and lathes at our Hardinge Taiwan facility in Nan Tou, Taiwan and our Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. facility in Jiaxing, China.
313716_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our plants located in Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, New York, Reutlingen, Germany, Noisy le Sec, France, Hyderabad, India and Shanghai, China.
313716_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, Mitsubishi Electric, a Japanese electronics company, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	The research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to cost of goods sold, amounted to $14.5 million , $13.9 million and $12.5 million , in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	In those cases, the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before it is shipped and the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	Lead time for these types of orders, especially grinding machines, can range from six to eight months.
313716_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of those customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the various countries in which we conduct business.
313716_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot now be estimated with any degree of certainty.
313716_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRPs"), agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the costs associated with the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	In July of 2012 the PRPs submitted a Remedial Investigation (RI) to respond to EPA issues raised in the initial draft RI.
313716_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	In January 2016, the PRPs submitted a draft Feasibility Study (FS), also to respond to issues raised by the EPA about previous drafts of the FS.
313716_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The recent draft FS identified alternative remedial actions with estimated life-cycle costs ranging from $0.9 million to $5.0 million .
313716_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	The Company s portion of the potential costs is estimated to range from $0.1 million to $0.7 million .
313716_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	Based on the current estimated costs of the various remedial alternatives now under consideration by the EPA, a reserve of $0.3 million has been recorded for the Company s share of remediation expenses at the Pond as of December 31, 2015 .
313716_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	This reserve is reported as an Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
313716_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , Hardinge Inc. employed 1,496 persons, 468 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 18.
313716_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	"Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
313716_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Current and potential shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for shareholders to consider.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In 2015, approximately 70% of our products were manufactured in countries outside of North America and approximately 66% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The availability of, and prices for, these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In 2015, approximately 30% of our sales were through distributors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2015.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Failure to achieve these objectives would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in commitments of significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	"Business - Environmental Matters", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Global economic and financial difficulties across the world in recent years have been well documented.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. subsequently intervened in an effort to improve economic conditions.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis, but also created instability, uncertainty and doubt.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	During this period, many of our customers experienced uncertain cash flows and reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which made commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	While global conditions appear to have improved, similar conditions in the future could negatively impact our operating results.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, causing our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We run the risk of bad debt with customers on open account.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	significant parts of our customer accounts receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of eight members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the Board of Directors has already designated 250,000 of such shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock) in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The 1.0 million shares sold under the controlled equity offering are the only equity securities sold pursuant to such registration statement thus far.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock, based upon market conditions and other factors.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The announcement that our Board of Directors, together with our management team is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our announcement that our Board of Directors, together with our management team is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including, among other things, a possible sale, merger or other form of business combination or strategic transaction, could disrupt our business and create uncertainty about our prospects as a stand-alone entity.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of whether a strategic transaction is completed.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	These risks to our business include:
313716_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	impairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel and other employees.
313716_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition, there can be no assurance whether or when any strategic transaction will be undertaken or thereafter consummated, and, even if a transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance as to whether or to what degree such a transaction will be successful in maximizing value to our stockholders.

313716_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	____________________ (1) On August 4, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program with the goals of streamlining the Company's cost structure, increasing operational efficiencies and improving shareholder returns.
313716_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	The restructuring charges incurred in 2015 is $3.6 million .
313716_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) 2014 and 2013 results include non-cash charges of $5.8 million and $6.2 million , respectively, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
313716_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	$5.8 million and $5.1 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, was related to the impairment in the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach, and $1.1 million in 2013 was related to the impairment of the Forkardt trade name as a result of the Forkardt Swiss business divestiture.
313716_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	(3) On December 31, 2013 , the Company divested its Forkardt Operations in Switzerland for CHF 5.6 million , net of cash sold ( $6.3 million equivalent), resulting in a gain of $4.9 million .
313716_16_ITEM6_P2_S3	In March 2014, the Company recognized $0.2 million of additional consideration as a result of final working capital adjustments.
313716_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ( U.S. ), and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Approximately 66% of our 2015 sales were to customers outside of North America, 70% of our 2015 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 69% of our employees in 2015 were employed outside of North America.
313716_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity monitored by our management include world machine tool shipments, as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report, and metal-cutting machine orders, as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	Similar information regarding machine tool shipments and economic indicators in foreign countries is published by trade associations, government agencies, and economic services in those countries.
313716_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts and service revenue, accounted for approximately 32% of overall sales in 2015 and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications.
313716_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ( sales ) and net orders ( orders ), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, our bank financing arrangements, and equity financing arrangements.
313716_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and non-performance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We continue to monitor our customers financial condition in order to mitigate the risk associated with our ability to collect on our accounts receivable.
313716_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan, which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ( GBP ), Chinese Renminbi ( CNY ), Euro ( EUR ), New Taiwanese Dollar ( TWD ), and Swiss Franc ( CHF ).
313716_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Under US GAAP, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ( USD ) at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly.
313716_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Presented below is summarized selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The table below summarizes sales by each corresponding geographical region for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands):

313716_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies that were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Changes in metalcutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_16_ITEM7_P109_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the Company.
313716_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indicators of impairment are present.
313716_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
313716_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
313716_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
313716_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and/or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
313716_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	We have three reporting units, only one of which currently has goodwill.
313716_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	Our ATA reporting unit had goodwill totaling $6.6 million as of December 31, 2015 .
313716_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
313716_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our annual goodwill impairment review was performed as of October 1, 2015.
313716_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	As a result of this assessment we determined that the fair value of our reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value.
313716_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and one postretirement benefit plan, all as described in Note 14.
313716_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	"Employee Benefits" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using rates of 4.75% and 4.28% at our plan measurement dates of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in blended rates of 1.21% and 1.43% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $13.5 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $11.2 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $19.1 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P123_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $15.6 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have an effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by less than $0.8 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by less than $0.8 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P124_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P124_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	For our domestic plans, the expected rate of return during fiscal 2016 is 7.50%, which is the same rate used for fiscal 2015 .
313716_16_ITEM7_P125_S4	For our foreign plans, we used rates of return appropriate for each country which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 3.91% for fiscal 2016 , compared to 3.95% for fiscal 2015 .
313716_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P127_S3	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	We are currently assessing the financial impact to our consolidated financial statements of accounting guidance not yet adopted.
313716_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	For further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to Note 20.
313716_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	"New Accounting Standards" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this 10-K.
313716_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company s ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company s entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company s ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_16_ITEM7_P130_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Overview" in Item 7.
313716_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of this Form 10-K.
313716_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 .
313716_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_16_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
313716_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated March 10, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
313716_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

313716_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or "the Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures and other industrial products.
313716_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Products are sold to customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
313716_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	A substantial portion of sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_16_ITEM8_P10_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company operates through two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ( MMS ) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ( ATA ).
313716_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	The MMS segment includes high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	The ATA segment includes products, primarily collets and chucks that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their Hardinge or other branded machines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America ("US GAAP") which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Occasionally, the Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits.
313716_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Additionally, restricted cash includes amounts due under mandatory principal reduction provisions associated with certain term debt agreements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the amount of restricted cash was approximately $2.2 million and $3.2 million , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	The financial condition of the Company's customers is performed periodically through credit reviews.
313716_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base.
313716_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Trade accounts receivable are considered to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off uncollectible balances when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
313716_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company will assess the valuation of inventory balances, and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	The net realizable value of such inventories is estimated based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The carrying value of inventory is also compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and inventory carrying value will be adjusted accordingly.
313716_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	If future demand for products is less favorable than forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or when events indicate that an impairment could exist.
313716_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
313716_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	The reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company has three reporting units.
313716_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company voluntarily changed the date of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing from the last day of the fiscal year to the first day of the fourth quarter.
313716_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	This voluntary change is preferable under the circumstances as it provides the Company with additional time to complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in advance of year-end reporting.
313716_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	The voluntary change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
313716_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	This change was not applied retrospectively, as doing so would require the use of significant estimates and assumptions that include hindsight.
313716_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	Accordingly, the change was applied prospectively.
313716_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by assessing a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	If it is determined after completing this assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a step-two impairment test is performed.
313716_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
313716_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
313716_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	As part of the impairment analysis, the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill is determined using the income approach and market approach.
313716_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the analysis is performed to determine the amount of the impairment.
313716_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment using an income approach.
313716_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for such excess.
313716_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
313716_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company's stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
313716_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, undiscounted cash flows are used to measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Accrued expenses include $10.5 million and $8.0 million in compensation related expenses at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as well as $7.2 million and $5.4 million of commissions payable.
313716_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.

313716_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	For the domestic and foreign plans (except for the Taiwan plan), discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations are based on the yields on high grade corporate bonds in each market with maturities matching the projected benefit payments.
313716_16_ITEM8_P209_S1	The discount rate for the Taiwan plan is based on the yield on long-dated government bonds plus a spread.
313716_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, for the domestic and foreign plans, management considers the current level of expected returns on least risk investments (primarily government bonds) in each market, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_16_ITEM8_P210_S1	The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	The market-related value of assets for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which the Company believes is consistent with the long-term nature of the pension obligations.

313716_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	Given the relatively long horizon of the aggregate obligation, the investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of the domestic and foreign plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility.
313716_16_ITEM8_P213_S1	This risk is managed primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range of its target asset allocation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P213_S2	In addition, the Company ensures that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.
313716_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	The domestic and foreign pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians.

313716_16_ITEM8_P217_S2	The foreign entities with defined benefit pension plans are included in the consolidated pension plans described earlier within this footnote.
313716_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	On May 3, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved the 2011 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan"), which was amended on May 6, 2014.
313716_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	The Plan's purpose is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders by attracting, retaining, and motivating officers and other key employees who make important contributions to the success of the Company.
313716_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Plan initially reserved 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the "Authorized Plan Amount") to be issued for grants of several different types of incentives including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock incentives, and performance share incentives.
313716_16_ITEM8_P219_S1	Any shares of common stock granted under options or stock appreciation rights prior to May 6, 2014 shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount on a one -for- one basis and any shares of common stock granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount as two ( 2 ) shares of common stock for every one ( 1 ) share of common stock subject to such award.
313716_16_ITEM8_P219_S2	On May 6, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to the plan to (a) increase the number of shares available for the plan to 1,500,000 , and (b) change the ratio of shares of common stock granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights to be counted against the Authorized Plan Amount as 1.75 shares of common stock for every one ( 1 ) share of common stock subject to such award.
313716_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	Authorized and issued shares of common stock or previously issued shares of common stock purchased by the Company for purposes of the Plan may be issued under the Plan.
313716_16_ITEM8_P221_S0	Stock-based compensation to employees is recorded in " Selling, general and administrative expenses " in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the fair value at the grant date of the award.
313716_16_ITEM8_P221_S1	These non-cash compensation costs were included in the " Depreciation and amortization " amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .
313716_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	A summary of stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	Restricted stock/unit awards, performance share incentives and stock options are the only award types currently outstanding.
313716_16_ITEM8_P223_S1	Restricted stock/unit awards and performance share incentives are discussed below.
313716_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	Stock option activity is not significant.
313716_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	Restricted stock/units (the "RSA") are awarded to employees.
313716_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	RSAs vest at the end of the service period and are subject to forfeiture as well as transfer restrictions.
313716_16_ITEM8_P225_S2	During the vesting period, the RSAs are held by the Company and the recipients are entitled to exercise rights pertaining to such shares, including the right to vote such shares.
313716_16_ITEM8_P225_S3	The RSAs are valued based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_16_ITEM8_P225_S4	The deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight-line basis over four years for all outstanding RSAs.
313716_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	A summary of the RSA activity is as follows (in shares):
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	Performance share incentives ("PSI") are awarded to certain employees.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S1	PSIs are expressed as shares of the Company's common stock.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S2	They are earned only if the Company meets specific performance targets over the specified performance period.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S3	During this period, PSI recipients have no voting rights.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S4	When dividends are declared, such dividends are deemed to be paid to the recipients.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S5	The Company withholds and accumulates the deemed dividends until such point that the PSIs are earned.
313716_16_ITEM8_P227_S6	If the PSIs are not earned, the accrued dividends are forfeited.
313716_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	The payment of PSIs can be in cash, or in the Company's common stock, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Company.
313716_16_ITEM8_P228_S1	The PSIs were first awarded to employees in 2011.
313716_16_ITEM8_P228_S2	The PSIs are valued based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	The deferred compensation is being recognized into earnings based on the passage of time and achievement of performance targets.
313716_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	A summary of the PSI activity is as follows (in shares):
313716_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	Changes in AOCI by component for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	Details about reclassification out of AOCI for the 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	____________________ (a) These AOCI components are included in the computation of net period pension and post retirement costs.
313716_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
313716_16_ITEM8_P234_S1	For diluted earnings (loss) per share, the weighted average number of shares includes common stock equivalents related to stock options and restricted stock.
313716_16_ITEM8_P234_S2	The following table presents the basis of the earnings (loss) per share computation (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , there were 15,995 shares, 39,752 shares, and 52,125 shares, respectively, of certain stock-based compensation awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they were anti-dilutive.
313716_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company operates through segments for which separate financial information is available, and for which operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	In 2013, the Company changed its reportable business segment from one reportable segment to two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_16_ITEM8_P236_S2	The Company has recast its segment information disclosure for all periods presented to conform to this segment presentation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_16_ITEM8_P237_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around two million dollars for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P237_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_16_ITEM8_P237_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	The Company engineers and sells high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	Turning Machines or lathes are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_16_ITEM8_P239_S2	On parts produced by Hardinge machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_16_ITEM8_P239_S3	Management considers Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from a built-in computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_16_ITEM8_P240_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_16_ITEM8_P240_S3	The Company supplies a broad line of machining centers under the Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	Grinding machines are used in a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_16_ITEM8_P241_S2	The Kellenberger and Usach grinding machines are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_16_ITEM8_P241_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_16_ITEM8_P242_S0	The Hauser jig grinding machines are used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Jones Shipman brand represents a line of high quality grinders (surface, creepfeed, and cylindrical) machines used by a wide range of industries.
313716_16_ITEM8_P243_S1	Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems.
313716_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	The prices of units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from fifty dollars on high volume collets to fifty thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks, and they typically are considered to be a fairly consumable, but durable, product.
313716_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Company's products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to Hardinge Brand.
313716_16_ITEM8_P245_S1	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not to the severity of the capital goods lines.
313716_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	The two primary product groups are collets and chucks.
313716_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_16_ITEM8_P249_S2	Some of the specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	While the Company's products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	Segment income is measured for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
313716_16_ITEM8_P251_S1	Corporate expenses consist primarily of executive employment costs, certain professional fees, and costs associated with the Company s global headquarters.
313716_16_ITEM8_P251_S2	Financial results for each reportable segment are as follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	____________________ (1) Segment assets primarily consist of restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid and other assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.
313716_16_ITEM8_P252_S1	Unallocated assets primarily include, cash and cash equivalents, corporate property, plant and equipment, deferred income taxes, and other non-current assets.
313716_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	A reconciliation of segment income to consolidated (loss) income from operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	A reconciliation of segment assets to consolidated total assets follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P255_S0	Unallocated assets include cash of $32.8 million , $16.3 million and $34.7 million at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
313716_16_ITEM8_P256_S0	There is no single customer who accounted for more than 6% of the consolidated sales in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
313716_16_ITEM8_P256_S1	Products are sold throughout the world and sales are attributed to countries based on the country where the products are shipped to.
313716_16_ITEM8_P256_S2	Information concerning the principal geographic areas is follows (in thousands):
313716_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	____________________ (1) Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets.
313716_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	Summarized quarterly financial information for 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
313716_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	____________________ (1) Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total earnings per share of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.
313716_16_ITEM8_P260_S0	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance on lease accounting revision.
313716_16_ITEM8_P260_S1	Key provisions include but not limited to the followings: 1) Lessee accounting model: Lessees will need to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S0	For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S1	Operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern; 2) Lessor accounting model: Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S2	lessors will continue the current practice to classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S3	Leveraged lease accounting has been eliminated; 3) Embedded leases: Different from the current risks and rewards model to identify embedded leases, under the new guidance, an arrangement contains an embedded lease if property, plant, or equipment is explicitly or implicitly identified and its use is controlled by the customer; 4) Sale-leaseback transactions: A sale-leaseback transaction will qualify as a sale only if i .
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S4	it meets the sale guidance in the new revenue recognition standard, ii.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S5	the leaseback is not a finance lease or a sales-type lease, and iii .
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S6	a repurchase option, if any, is priced at the asset s fair value at the time of exercise and the asset is not specialized.
313716_16_ITEM8_P261_S7	If the transaction fails sale treatment, the buyer and seller will reflect it as a financing; 5) Disclosures: Extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing contracts.
313716_16_ITEM8_P262_S0	The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
313716_16_ITEM8_P262_S1	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
313716_16_ITEM8_P262_S2	Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
313716_16_ITEM8_P262_S3	The Company is evaluating the method to adopt this guidance and its impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P263_S0	In January 2016, FASB issued updated authoritative guidance on recognition and measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
313716_16_ITEM8_P263_S1	The guidance changes to the current GAAP model primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
313716_16_ITEM8_P263_S2	In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
313716_16_ITEM8_P264_S0	Except for those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities will generally be measured at fair value through earnings for equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
313716_16_ITEM8_P264_S1	For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, entities will be able to elect to record them at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes.
313716_16_ITEM8_P264_S2	Changes in the basis of these equity investments will be reported in current earnings.
313716_16_ITEM8_P264_S3	The impairment model for equity investments subject to this election is a single-step model (unlike today s two-step approach).
313716_16_ITEM8_P265_S0	When the fair value option has been elected for financial liabilities, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income.
313716_16_ITEM8_P265_S1	The accumulated gains and losses due to these changes will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings if the financial liability is settled before maturity.
313716_16_ITEM8_P266_S0	Entities will be required to use the exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for disclosure purposes.
313716_16_ITEM8_P266_S1	In addition, the new guidance requires financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category (e.g., fair value, amortized cost, lower of cost or market) and form of financial asset (e.g., loans, securities).The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
313716_16_ITEM8_P266_S2	The Company is evaluating the method to adopt this guidance and its impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P267_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes.
313716_16_ITEM8_P267_S1	The guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position as oppose to that deferred income tax liabilities and assets are separated into current and noncurrent amounts under current GAAP.
313716_16_ITEM8_P267_S2	For public business entities, the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
313716_16_ITEM8_P267_S3	The guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
313716_16_ITEM8_P267_S4	If an entity applies the guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
313716_16_ITEM8_P268_S0	The Company is evaluating the method to adopt this guidance and its impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P269_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the valuation of inventory.
313716_16_ITEM8_P269_S1	This guidance directs an entity to measure inventory at lower of cost and net realizable value, versus lower of cost or market.
313716_16_ITEM8_P269_S2	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
313716_16_ITEM8_P269_S3	Early application is permitted, and the guidance should be applied prospectively.
313716_16_ITEM8_P269_S4	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P270_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs.
313716_16_ITEM8_P270_S1	This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
313716_16_ITEM8_P270_S2	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
313716_16_ITEM8_P270_S3	Early application is permitted, and the guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P271_S0	Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle.
313716_16_ITEM8_P271_S1	The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have material impacts on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P272_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on management's evaluation and disclosure of uncertainties about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
313716_16_ITEM8_P272_S1	In connection with the preparation of the interim and annual financial statements, management will be required to perform an assessment of whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
313716_16_ITEM8_P272_S2	If conditions or events are identified that raise substantial doubt that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, additional disclosures are required.
313716_16_ITEM8_P272_S3	This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods thereafter.
313716_16_ITEM8_P272_S4	The adoption of this accounting guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements or related disclosures.
313716_16_ITEM8_P273_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for revenue recognition.
313716_16_ITEM8_P273_S1	The objective of this guidance is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S0	The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S1	In applying the new guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S2	In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this standard by one year, but will allow companies to apply the standard on its original effective date of December 15, 2016.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S3	The new guidance is now effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017 for public companies.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S4	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt this guidance.
313716_16_ITEM8_P274_S5	The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on the financial statements, nor decided upon the method of adoption.
313716_16_ITEM8_P275_S0	In April 2014, FASB issued authoritative guidance on the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations.
313716_16_ITEM8_P275_S1	This guidance is effective for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
313716_16_ITEM8_P275_S2	We adopted the guidance in January 2015.
313716_16_ITEM8_P275_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

313716_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

313716_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria.

313716_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have manufacturing facilities located in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, Germany, France, India, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").
313716_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We manufacture the majority of the products we sell.
313716_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company has two unique business segments: Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some standard products to approximately two million dollars for specialized grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles, as customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, Usach, and Voumard grinding brands.
313716_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce machine operator involvement in the production process.
313716_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Usach and Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems used in production and job shop environments.
313716_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic, or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from an integrated computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our machines generally use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	The machines are able to produce parts while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	New products are critical to our growth plans.
313716_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We gain access to new products through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with hard to sustain close tolerances and hard to achieve surface finishes that may be hard to hold in the machine.
313716_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing to demanding specifications.
313716_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Multiple options are available on many of our machines, which allows customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Certain parts on machines wear out, fail, or need to be replaced due to misuse over time.
313716_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	We offer these post sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from forty dollars on high volume collets to two hundred thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks.
313716_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	While considered to be consumable, these products are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time.
313716_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not as severely as capital goods lines.
313716_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	While customers may not purchase high cost machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks.
313716_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod-like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating work piece.
313716_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in tens of thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs.
313716_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications.
313716_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	In certain areas of China, France, Germany, India, North America, and the United Kingdom, we have also used a direct sales force for portions of our product lines.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S5	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S6	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_17_ITEM1_P38_S7	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our standard ATA products are sold through direct telephone orders and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents.
313716_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_17_ITEM1_P39_S4	In other parts of the world, these products are sold on either a direct sales basis or through distributor arrangements.
313716_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	We promote our products through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through the publication of general catalogs and other targeted catalogs, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	We have a considerable presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products and repair parts.
313716_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2016 or 2015 .
313716_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	For basic products, often the barriers are not technical; they are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post sales support required by customers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling and accessories.
313716_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	We compete with multiple companies in each market sector we serve.
313716_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are reliability, price, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_17_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas, which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our internal and outer diameter (ID/OD) cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by Studer, a Swiss company, as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S5	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S6	Our surface grinding machines compete with products manufactured by Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_17_ITEM1_P46_S7	Our ATA products compete with many products manufactured by smaller companies.
313716_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	As we expand into new market areas, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing and sales positions in those markets.
313716_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	The Kellenberger and Voumard grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	We produce machining centers and lathes at our Hardinge Taiwan facility in Nan Tou, Taiwan and our Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. facility in Jiaxing, China.
313716_17_ITEM1_P48_S6	The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our plants located in Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, New York, Reutlingen, Germany, Noisy le Sec, France, Hyderabad, India and Shanghai, China.
313716_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies and historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, Mitsubishi Electric, a Japanese electronics company, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet market demands, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical to doctoral degrees.
313716_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operating expense, amounted to $13.5 million , $14.1 million and $13.9 million , in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machine tools, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling and specific programming.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	In those cases, the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before shipment so the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	Lead time for these types of orders, especially grinding machines, can range from six to eight months.
313716_17_ITEM1_P56_S5	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the various countries in which we conduct business.
313716_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	In particular, our Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") because of groundwater contamination.
313716_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the "Site") encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") for the Koppers Pond (the "Pond") portion of the Site.
313716_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Environmental sampling on our property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that our operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	We have notified all appropriate insurance carriers and are actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty at this time.
313716_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on our property.
313716_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRP's"), agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	The PRP's also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the costs associated with the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	In July of 2012 the PRP's submitted a Remedial Investigation (RI) to respond to EPA issues raised in the initial draft RI.
313716_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	In January 2016, the PRP's submitted a draft Feasibility Study (FS), also to respond to issues raised by the EPA about previous drafts of the FS.
313716_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	In July 2016, the EPA announced its proposed remediation plan based on an alternative put forth in a July 2016 Woodruff Curran FS with an estimated total clean-up phase cost of $1.9 million.
313716_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	The preferred remedy consists of the placement of a continuous six-inch thick soil and sand cap, including a geotextile membrane to act as a demarcation layer, over Koppers Pond.
313716_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	The preferred remedy includes long-term monitoring and institutional controls.
313716_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	After a public comment period the EPA concluded this RI phase of its process documented in a letter in December 2016.
313716_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Company has recorded a reserve of $0.3 million for its estimated related liability, assuming all of the PRP's would continue to share costs equally in the clean-up phase of the project.
313716_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Based on our understanding including discussions with our experts, it is possible that the PRP's may change and/or the relative split of costs may be different for this final phase of the project.
313716_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	However, this will not be known for quite some time, and this ongoing estimate of 7 split equally is viewed as the best possible estimate at the moment.
313716_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	This reserve is reported in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
313716_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Hardinge Inc. employed 1,451 persons, 463 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 18.
313716_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	"Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
313716_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Current and potential shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for shareholders to consider.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In 2016, approximately 71% of our products were manufactured in countries outside of North America and approximately 68% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The availability of, and prices for, these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We maintain an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In 2016, approximately 30% of our sales were through distributors.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2016.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Failure to achieve these objectives would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in commitments of significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	"Business - Environmental Matters", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology systems as well as other cybersecurity risks and business disruptions.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third party information technology systems, which may result from attacks on or failures of such infrastructure.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Cybersecurity risks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, attacks on our information technology systems and attacks on the information technology systems of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Cybersecurity risks may also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into our customers facilities and/or infrastructure.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such attacks could potentially result in disruptions to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from these potential attacks.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such attacks or other disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other damaging effects on our operations or our ability to provide products and services to our customers, the unintended release of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other improper use of our or third party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, causing our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We run the risk of bad debt with customers on open account.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of nine members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the Board of Directors has already designated 250,000 of such shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock) in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.
313716_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Pertinent information concerning the principal properties of the Company and its subsidiaries is as follows:
313716_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is from time to time involved in routine litigation incidental to its operations.
313716_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	None of the litigation in which we are currently involved, individually or in the aggregate, is anticipated to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table reflects the highest and lowest values at which our common stock traded in each quarter of the last two years.

313716_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	____________________ (1) In 2016, we reclassified Research development expenses from Cost of sales to Operating expenses for all years presented.
313716_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	(2) On August 4, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program with the goals of streamlining the Company's cost structure, increasing operational efficiencies and improving shareholder returns, which was completed in 2016.
313716_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	(3) 2014 and 2013 results include non-cash charges of $5.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
313716_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	$5.8 million and $5.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, was related to the impairment in the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach, and $1.1 million in 2013 was related to the impairment of the Forkardt trade name as a result of the Forkardt Swiss business divestiture.
313716_17_ITEM6_P2_S2	(4) On December 31, 2013 , the Company divested its Forkardt Operations in Switzerland for CHF 5.6 million , net of cash sold ( $6.3 million equivalent), resulting in a gain of $4.9 million.
313716_17_ITEM6_P2_S3	In March 2014, the Company recognized $0.2 million of additional consideration as a result of final working capital adjustments.
313716_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability and value.
313716_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ( U.S. ), and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	Approximately 68% of our 2016 sales were to customers outside of North America, 71% of our 2016 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 68% of our employees in 2016 were employed outside of North America.
313716_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity monitored by our management include world machine tool shipments, as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report, and metal-cutting machine orders, as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	Similar information regarding machine tool shipments and economic indicators in foreign countries is published by trade associations, government agencies, and economic services in those countries.
313716_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts and service revenue, accounted for approximately 33% of overall sales in 2016 and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications.
313716_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ( sales ), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, our bank financing arrangements, and equity financing arrangements.
313716_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and non-performance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We continue to monitor our customers financial condition in order to mitigate the risk associated with our ability to collect on our accounts receivable.
313716_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	competitive pricing in all of our markets.

313716_17_ITEM7_P73_S5	Additionally, the Company had borrowings under revolving credit facilities of $0.7 million at December 31, 2016.
313716_17_ITEM7_P73_S6	Details of these financing arrangements are discussed in Note 8: "Financing Arrangements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	We lease space for some of our manufacturing, sales and service operations with lease terms up to 7 years and use certain office equipment and automobiles under lease agreements expiring at various dates.
313716_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Rent expense under these leases totaled $3.0 million , $3.3 million and $3.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table shows our future commitments in effect as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.
313716_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , the expected Company contributions to be paid to the qualified defined benefit domestic plan are $2.0 million and the expected Company contributions to the foreign defined benefit pension plans are $2.3 million .
313716_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	We believe that the current available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds from operations, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2017 .
313716_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	There were no significant changes to accounting policies in 2016.
313716_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies that were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's past history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Changes in metalcutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_17_ITEM7_P85_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the Company.
313716_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indicators of impairment are present.
313716_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
313716_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
313716_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
313716_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and/or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
313716_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	We have three reporting units, only one of which currently has goodwill.
313716_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	Our ATA reporting unit had goodwill totaling $6.6 million as of December 31, 2016 .
313716_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
313716_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our annual goodwill impairment review was performed as of October 1, 2016.
313716_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	As a result of this assessment we determined that the fair value of our reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value.
313716_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	A full valuation allowance is maintained on the tax benefits of the U.S. net deferred tax assets and it is expected that a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits will be recorded until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	A valuation allowance is also maintained on the U.K., German, Dutch, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	The calculation of the tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	The provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, and India.
313716_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and two postretirement benefit plans, all as described in Note 14.
313716_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	"Employee Benefits" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using rates of 4.39% and 4.75% at our plan measurement dates of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in blended rates of 0.89% and 1.21% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $13.5 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $11.2 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $19.4 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P103_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $15.9 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have an effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. 2017 pension expense by approximately $0.09 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. 2017 pension expense by approximately $0.03 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.5 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P104_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.8 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	return during fiscal 2017 is 7.50%, which is the same rate used for fiscal 2016 .
313716_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	For our foreign plans, we used rates of return appropriate for each country which resulted in a blended expected rate of return of 3.14% for fiscal 2017 , compared to 3.91% for fiscal 2016 .
313716_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P107_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $0.9 million.
313716_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	We are currently assessing the financial impact to our consolidated financial statements of accounting guidance not yet adopted.
313716_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	For further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to Note 20.
313716_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	"New Accounting Standards" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company s ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company s entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company s ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_17_ITEM7_P110_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Overview" in Item 7.
313716_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of this Form 10-K.
313716_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
313716_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
313716_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
313716_17_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
313716_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
313716_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
313716_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, effective December 31, 2016.
313716_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 3, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or "the Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures and other industrial products.
313716_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Products are sold to customers in North America, Europe and Asia.
313716_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	A substantial portion of sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment and transportation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company operates through two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ( MMS ) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ( ATA ).
313716_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	The MMS segment includes high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	The ATA segment includes products, primarily collets and chucks that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their Hardinge or other branded machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America ("US GAAP") which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Occasionally, the Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits.
313716_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	Additionally, restricted cash includes amounts due under mandatory principal reduction provisions associated with certain term debt agreements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of restricted cash was approximately $2.9 million and $2.2 million , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	A review of the financial condition of the Company's customers is performed periodically through credit reviews.
313716_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base.
313716_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Trade accounts receivable are considered to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off of uncollectible balances occurs when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.8 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.
313716_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor and overhead.
313716_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company assesses the valuation of inventory balances, and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The net realizable value of such inventories is estimated based on analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	The carrying value of inventory is also compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and inventory carrying value will be adjusted accordingly.
313716_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P23_S4	If future demand for products is less favorable than forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Major additions, renewals or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or when events indicate that an impairment could exist.
313716_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	The reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company has three reporting units.
313716_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by assessing a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	If it is determined after completing this assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a step-two impairment test is performed.
313716_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
313716_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill is determined using the income approach and market approach.
313716_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the analysis is performed to determine the amount of the impairment.
313716_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of October 1, 2016 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill was less than that its applicable carrying value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
313716_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	See Note 7: "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for more information.
313716_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization.
313716_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	They are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment, if indicators of impairment are identified.
313716_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
313716_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company's stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums or other variables.
313716_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, undiscounted cash flows are used to measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Accrued expenses include $8.0 million and $10.5 million in compensation related expenses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as well as $7.2 million of commissions payable for both years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.
313716_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_17_ITEM8_P37_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	A full valuation allowance is maintained on the tax benefits of the U.S. net deferred tax assets and it is expected that a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits will be recorded until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	A valuation allowance is also maintained on the U.K., German, Dutch, and Canadian deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The calculation of the tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, and India.
313716_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
313716_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives and returns.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S4	In the rare case that a machine return is permitted, a restocking fee is typically charged.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders which are not eligible for return.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_17_ITEM8_P42_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Prior to shipment, each machine is tested to ensure the machine's compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in the promotional literature.
313716_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	On an exception basis, where larger multiple machine installations are delivered which require run-offs and customer acceptance at their facility, revenue is recognized in the period of customer acceptance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Taxes assessed by different governmental authorities are collected and remitted that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the Company and its customers.
313716_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	These taxes may include sales, use and value-added taxes.
313716_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The collection of these taxes is reported on a net basis (excluded from revenues).
313716_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Shipping and handling costs are recorded as part of cost of goods sold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company offers warranties for products sold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the product was sold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	A basic limited warranty is generally provided for a period of one to two years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	The costs that may be incurred are estimated under the basic limited warranty, based largely upon actual warranty repair cost history and we record a liability for such costs when the related product revenue is recognized.
313716_17_ITEM8_P46_S4	The resulting accrual balance is reviewed during the year.
313716_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Factors that affect the warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
313716_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Extended warranties for some of the Company's products are also sold.
313716_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	These extended warranties usually cover a one year to two year period that begins after the basic warranty expires.
313716_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	Revenue from extended warranties are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis across the term of the warranty contract.
313716_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	These liabilities are reported in " Accrued expenses " in the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
313716_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	The costs associated with research and development programs for new products and significant product improvements are expensed as incurred and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
313716_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
313716_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Net assets are translated at month end exchange rates while income, expense and cash flow items are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period.
313716_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
313716_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included as a component of " Other expense, net " in the Consolidated Statements of Operations .
313716_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, long-term debt and foreign currency forwards.
313716_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	"Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for additional disclosure.
313716_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	As a multinational company, the results of operations and financial condition are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
313716_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	To manage this risk, derivative instruments are entered into, namely in the form of foreign currency forwards.
313716_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	These derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on balance sheet exposures of both trade and intercompany assets and liabilities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P54_S3	This exposure is hedged with contracts settling in less than one year .
313716_17_ITEM8_P54_S4	These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
313716_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are recognized immediately in earnings.
313716_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	There are some forward contracts to hedge certain customer orders and vendor firm commitments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	These contracts are typically for less than one year , and have maturity dates in alignment with the recognition dates of the underlying financial transactions.
313716_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as cash flow hedges.
313716_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	Unrealized gains or losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of these hedging contracts are charged to other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying transaction is recognized through earnings.
313716_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	Gains or losses on any ineffective portion of the contracts are recognized in earnings.
313716_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the estimated fair value of the award as of the grant date and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
313716_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
313716_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
313716_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	On September 22, 2014 , Hardinge Inc., along with its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Hardinge GmbH and L. Kellenberger Co., AG acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with a product line of grinding machine systems and applications marketed and sold under the Voumard brand from Peter Wolters GmbH.
313716_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The purchase price was EUR 1.7 million (approximately $2.2 million ), before taking into account customary purchase price adjustments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The acquisition of Voumard expands the Company's product offerings to include internal diameter ("ID") cylindrical grinding solutions, which are a complement to the existing grinding product lines offered by the Company.
313716_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	The acquisition was funded with cash and has been included in the MMS business segment.
313716_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Voumard is a global leader in the ID grinding market with an installed base of over 9,000 machine solutions serving more than 2,500 customers around the world.
313716_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The results of operations of Voumard have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
313716_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	Acquisition related costs of $0.1 million were incurred related to the acquisition of the Voumard business for the year ended December 31, 2014 and reported in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
313716_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.
313716_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The identifiable intangible assets acquired, which primarily consists of drawings of $0.1 million , were valued using a cost approach.
313716_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	The fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities exceeded the purchase price of Voumard, resulting in a gain on the purchase of $0.5 million .
313716_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	The values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were finalized during the third quarter 2015, resulting in no valuation adjustments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Voumard acquisition at the date of acquisition (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on the Company s consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 as if the Voumard acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2014 (in thousands, except per share data) :
313716_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	____________________ (1) The pro forma results above include abbreviated financial results for Voumard, consisting of revenues and direct expenses for that product line.
313716_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, but prior to its acquisition by the Company, the Voumard business incurred $4.9 million in restructuring charges, which included inventory write-offs, headcount reductions and other related costs.
313716_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	These amounts are included in the pro forma information presented above.
313716_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The above unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on the date assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods.
313716_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
313716_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
313716_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
313716_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	The following table presents the carrying amount, fair values, and classification level within the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are based on the fair values of identical assets in active markets.
313716_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Due to the short period to maturity or the nature of the underlying liability, the fair value of variable interest rate debt approximates their respective carrying amounts.
313716_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	Based on the Company s continued ability to enter into forward contracts, the markets for the fair value instruments are considered to be active.
313716_17_ITEM8_P73_S4	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , there were no significant transfers in and/or out of Level 1 and Level 2.
313716_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	The following table presents the fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the foreign currency forward contracts (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company applied fair value principles during goodwill impairment tests.
313716_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Step one of the goodwill impairment test consisted of determining a fair value for each of the Company's reporting units.
313716_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The fair value for the Company's reporting units cannot be determined using readily available quoted Level 1 or Level 2 inputs that are observable or available from active markets.
313716_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	Therefore, the Company used valuation models to estimate the fair values of its reporting units, which use Level 3 inputs.
313716_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	To estimate the fair values of reporting units, the Company uses significant estimates and judgmental factors.
313716_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The key estimates and factors used in the valuation models included revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, WACC, and earnings multiples.
313716_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	As a result of the goodwill impairment test performed during 2014, the Company recognized goodwill impairment charges (See Note 7.
313716_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	"Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for more information regarding the Company's goodwill impairment tests).
313716_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	During 2014 , the Company recognized impairments to intangible assets associated with trade names.
313716_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	The impairment charges were calculated by determining the fair value of these assets.
313716_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	The fair value measurements were calculated using discounted cash flow analysis, which rely upon unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs.
313716_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The key estimates and factors used in the valuation models, for which the Company used significant estimates and judgmental factors, include revenue growth rates based on internal forecasts, royalty rates and discounts rates (See Note 7.
313716_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	"Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for more information regarding the impairment of intangible assets).
313716_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The fair values and classification of the defined benefit plan assets is as follows (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	____________________ (1) Growth funds represent a type of fund containing a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities with a goal of capital appreciation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	(2) Income funds represent a type of fund with an emphasis on current income as opposed to capital appreciation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	Such funds may contain a variety of domestic and international government and corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments and dividend-paying stocks.
313716_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	(3) Growth and income funds represent a type of fund containing a combination of growth and income securities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	(4) Hedge funds represent a managed portfolio of investments that use advanced investment strategies such as leveraged, long, short and derivative positions in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns.
313716_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	These funds are subject to quarterly redemptions and advanced notification requirements, as well as the right to delay redemption until sufficient fund liquidity exists.
313716_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	A summary of the changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans assets classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is as follows (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Most of the defined benefit pension plan's Level 1 assets are debt and equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally.
313716_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	They are measured at fair value using closing prices from active markets.
313716_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Level 2 assets are typically investments in pooled funds, which are measured based on the value of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
313716_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	The fair value of the Level 3 plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
313716_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Net inventories consist of the following (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as on forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
313716_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	These contracts are considered derivative instruments and are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	Generally these contracts have a term of less than one year .
313716_17_ITEM8_P90_S3	The valuations of these derivatives are measured at fair value based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates.
313716_17_ITEM8_P90_S4	A group of highly rated domestic and international banks are used in order to mitigate counterparty risk on the forward contracts.
313716_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	For contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the contracts is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) into the Sales or Cost of sales line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings, or Other expense, net when the hedging relationship is deemed to be ineffective.
313716_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments designated to qualify for cash flow hedges were $45.5 million and $27.4 million , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Company expects approximately $0.1 million of net losses, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.
313716_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments not qualifying or otherwise designated as hedges were $35.4 million and $38.5 million , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , losses of $0.1 million and $0.8 million , respectively, were recorded related to this type of derivative financial instruments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	For contracts that are not designated as hedges, the gain or loss on the contracts are recognized in current earnings in the Other expense, net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations .
313716_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	Property, plant and equipment consists of the following (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Depreciation expense was $6.6 million , $7.0 million , and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
313716_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	Detail and activity of goodwill by segment is presented below (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit's carrying amount is greater than its fair value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Company performed a qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2016 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill was less than that its applicable carrying value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any reporting unit in 2016.
313716_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	In 2015, the Company performed a review and test of goodwill and determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount for all of our reporting units with goodwill.
313716_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Based on lower than expected performance in the Usach reporting unit during 2014 , combined with a downward revision in the anticipated future results, the Company determined that there were indicators of an impairment of that reporting unit during the third quarter of 2014 .
313716_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	Accordingly, a goodwill impairment charge of $4.8 million was recognized in the " Impairment charges " caption in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in that reporting unit during the third quarter of 2014 , resulting in the entire MMS goodwill balance to be written off.
313716_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Subsequently, the Company performed the annual impairment analysis for the ATA reporting unit, which resulted in the fair value exceeding the carrying value.
313716_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	The Company performed further analysis of the reporting units' long-lived assets and determined that impairment of these assets was not present.

313716_17_ITEM8_P218_S6	If the PSIs are not earned, the accrued dividends are forfeited.
313716_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	The payment of PSIs can be in cash, or in the Company's common stock, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Company.
313716_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	The PSIs were first awarded to employees in 2011.
313716_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	The PSIs are valued based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.
313716_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	The deferred compensation is being recognized into earnings based on the passage of time and achievement of performance targets.

313716_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were15,995 and 39,752 shares of certain stock-based compensation awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they were anti-dilutive.
313716_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company operates through segments for which separate financial information is available, and for which operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	The two reportable business segments are Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately forty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around two million dollars for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P228_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_17_ITEM8_P228_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as customers seek productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company engineers and sells high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	Turning Machines or lathes are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_17_ITEM8_P230_S2	On parts produced by Hardinge machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_17_ITEM8_P230_S3	Management considers Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming and routing.
313716_17_ITEM8_P231_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from an integrated computer control without operator assistance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P231_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_17_ITEM8_P231_S3	The Company supplies a broad line of machining centers under the Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	Grinding machines are used in a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_17_ITEM8_P232_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_17_ITEM8_P232_S2	The Kellenberger and Usach grinding machines are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_17_ITEM8_P232_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Hauser jig grinding machines are used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_17_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Jones Shipman brand is a line of high quality grinder (surface, creepfeed, and cylindrical) machines used by a wide range of industries.
313716_17_ITEM8_P234_S1	Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems.
313716_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	The prices of units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from forty dollars on high volume collets to two hundred thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks, and they typically are considered to be a fairly consumable, but durable, product.
313716_17_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company's products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to Hardinge Brand machines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P237_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not as severely as capital goods lines.
313716_17_ITEM8_P237_S1	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P238_S0	The two primary product groups are collets and chucks.
313716_17_ITEM8_P239_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_17_ITEM8_P240_S1	A chuck is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_17_ITEM8_P240_S2	Some of the specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	While the Company's products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_17_ITEM8_P242_S0	Segment income is measured for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
313716_17_ITEM8_P242_S1	Corporate expenses consist primarily of executive employment costs, certain professional fees, and costs associated with the Company s global headquarters.
313716_17_ITEM8_P242_S2	Financial results for each reportable segment are as follows (in thousands):
313716_17_ITEM8_P243_S0	____________________ (1) Segment assets primarily consist of restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid and other assets, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.

313716_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	Summarized quarterly financial information for 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
313716_17_ITEM8_P251_S0	____________________ (1) Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total earnings per share of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	No. 2017-01 Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business .
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S1	This guidance revises the definition of a business and may affect acquisitions, disposals, goodwill impairment and consolidation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S2	The new guidance specifies that when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S3	The changes to the definition of a business in this guidance will likely result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions and would also affect the accounting for disposal transactions.
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S4	The new guidance is effective in 2018.
313716_17_ITEM8_P252_S5	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements.

313716_17_ITEM8_P255_S2	These standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P255_S3	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S1	The guidance simplifies several areas of accounting for share based compensation arrangements, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S2	This guidance is expected to impact net income, EPS, and the statement of cash flows.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S3	In particular, the tax effects of all stock compensation awards will be included in income.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S4	The guidance is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P256_S5	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements.

313716_17_ITEM8_P257_S1	The new guidance clarifies that a change in counterparty to a derivative contract (i.e. a novation), in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a hedging relationship provided that all other hedging criteria continue to be met.
313716_17_ITEM8_P257_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
313716_17_ITEM8_P257_S3	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P258_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model.
313716_17_ITEM8_P258_S1	ASU 2016-02 clarifies the definition of a lease, requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications, and requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months.
313716_17_ITEM8_P258_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within the fiscal year, and requires modified retrospective application.
313716_17_ITEM8_P258_S3	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P259_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments under the fair value option, as well as the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
313716_17_ITEM8_P259_S1	Among other things, the new guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
313716_17_ITEM8_P259_S2	In addition, the guidance requires public companies to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, to separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and to eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost.
313716_17_ITEM8_P259_S3	The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
313716_17_ITEM8_P259_S4	The Company is evaluating the method to adopt this guidance and its impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S1	The guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S2	For public business entities, the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S3	The guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S4	We adopted this guidance in December 2016, electing to apply it retrospectively to all periods presented.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S5	As a result, the Company reclassified $2.1 million and $2.2 million from current deferred tax assets and liabilities, respectively, reducing Other current assets and Deferred tax liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015.
313716_17_ITEM8_P260_S6	Non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities increased by $1.9 million and $2.0 million , respectively, resulting in an increase to Other non-current assets and Deferred income taxes on the Consolidate Balance Sheets, as of December 31, 2015.

313716_17_ITEM8_P262_S2	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter.
313716_17_ITEM8_P262_S3	The Company uses estimated net realizable value as an approximation of fair value and therefore does not anticipate any changes to our financial statements as a result of this guidance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P263_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
313716_17_ITEM8_P263_S1	This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
313716_17_ITEM8_P263_S2	In January 2016, the Company adopted the guidance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P263_S3	As a result, the Company reclassified $0.07 million and $0.09 million of debt issuance cost as of December 31, 2015 into Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt respectively to reduce the carrying amount of debt liability, from Other current assets and Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
313716_17_ITEM8_P263_S4	Unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.07 million and $0.02 million were recorded as Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt respectively to reduce the carrying amount of debt liability, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.

313716_17_ITEM8_P264_S1	Under the new standard, disclosures are required when conditions give rise to substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date.
313716_17_ITEM8_P264_S2	The new standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter.
313716_17_ITEM8_P264_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S2	This update provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S3	The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S4	We have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt this guidance.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S5	Between August 2015 and May 2016, the FASB issued four additional updates to 1) ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date , 2) ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), 3) ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and 4) ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients to provide further guidance and clarification in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S6	The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and all annual and interim periods thereafter.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S7	The Company has not determined the impact this standard may have on the financial statements, nor decided upon the method of adoption.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S8	The Company expects to complete a diagnostic assessment and begin developing solutions in the first half of 2017.
313716_17_ITEM8_P265_S9	In the second half of 2017, the Company expects to implement and test any changes in policy, processes, systems and internal controls and compute required transition adjustments and disclosures.

313716_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
313716_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
313716_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
313716_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated March 3, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

313716_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability, and value.
313716_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company has two unique business segments: Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	For further information regarding financial information about our segments and geographic areas, refer to Note 17.
313716_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	"Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling machines, as discussed below, and related repair parts and services.
313716_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately thirty thousand dollars for some standard products to approximately two million dollars for specialized grinding machines or turnkey systems that are designed and built for specific customer needs.
313716_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles, as customers are looking for productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have been a manufacturer of industrial-use high precision and general precision turning machine tools since 1890.
313716_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Turning machines, or lathes, are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	On parts produced by our machines, those dimensions are often measured in millionths of an inch.
313716_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	We consider Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very tight tolerances.
313716_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Grinding is a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to tight tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	The grinding machines of our Kellenberger subsidiary are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	The Kellenberger grinding machines are generally purchased by the same type of customers as other Hardinge equipment and further our ability to be a primary source for our customers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our Kellenberger precision grinding technology is complemented by our Hauser, Tschudin, Voumard, and Usach grinding brands.
313716_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Hauser machines are jig grinders used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Tschudin product technology is focused on the specialized grinding of cylindrical parts when the customer requires high volume production.
313716_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our Tschudin machines are generally equipped with automatic loading and unloading mechanisms for the part being machined.
313716_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	These loading and unloading mechanisms significantly reduce machine operator involvement in the production process.
313716_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems used in production and job shop environments.
313716_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Usach builds special purpose machines for internal diameter, outer diameter, and multiple grinding processes mix of internal diameter and outer diameter.
313716_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	Usach typically sells the machines as a turnkey system with integrated automation and value added processes such as probe and measuring.
313716_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Milling machines (also known as machining centers) are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic, or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming, and routing.
313716_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from an integrated computer control without the assistance of an operator.
313716_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	We supply a broad line of machining centers under our Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our machines generally use commands from an integrated computer to control the movement of cutting tools, grinding wheels, part positioning, and in the case of turning and grinding machines, the rotation speeds of the part being shaped.
313716_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	The computer control enables the operator to program operations such as part rotation, tooling selection, and tooling movement for a specific part and then stores that program in memory for future use.
313716_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	while left unattended when connected to automatic bar-feeding, robotics equipment, or other material handling devices designed to supply raw materials and remove machined parts from the machine.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	The introduction of new machines are critical to our growth plans.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	We gain access to new machine offerings through internal product development, acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Products are introduced each year to broaden our product offering, to take advantage of new technologies available to us, and to replace older models nearing the end of their respective product life cycles.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	These technologies generally allow our machines to run at higher speeds and with more power, thus increasing their efficiency.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	Customers routinely replace old machines with newer machines that can produce parts faster and with less time to set up the machine when converting from one type of part to another.
313716_18_ITEM1_P24_S5	Generally, our machines can be used to produce parts from all of the standard ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as plastics, composites, and exotic materials.
313716_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	We focus on products and solutions for companies making parts from hard to machine materials with tough to sustain, tight tolerances and difficult to attain surface finishes that may be hard to achieve with competitor machines.
313716_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that with our high precision and super precision lathes, our grinding machines, and our rugged machining centers, combined with our accessory products and our technical expertise, we are uniquely qualified to be the supplier of choice for customers manufacturing products to demanding specifications.
313716_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Multiple options are available on many of our machines, which allows customers to customize their machines to their specific operating performance and cost objectives.
313716_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We produce machines for stock with popular option combinations for immediate delivery, as well as design and produce machines to specific customer requirements.
313716_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition to our machines, we provide the necessary tooling, accessories, and support services to assist customers in maximizing their return on investment.
313716_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The sale of repair parts is important to our business.
313716_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Certain parts on machines may need to be replaced due to normal wear over many operating cycles or improper operation of the machine.
313716_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Customers will buy parts from us throughout the life of the machine, which typically extends over many years.
313716_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	There are thousands of machines in operation in the world for which we provide those repair parts and in many cases the parts are available exclusively from us.
313716_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We offer various warranties on our equipment and consider post-sale support to be a critical element of our business.
313716_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Warranties on machines typically extend for twelve months after purchase.
313716_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	Services provided include operation and maintenance training, in-field maintenance, and in-field repair.
313716_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	We offer these post-sales support services on a paid basis throughout the life of the machine.
313716_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	In territories covered by distributors, this support and service is offered through the distributor.
313716_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	The selling prices of these units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from forty dollars on high volume collets to two hundred thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks.
313716_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	While considered to be consumable, these products are more durable in nature, with replacement due to wear over time.
313716_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to our own.
313716_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not as severely as capital goods lines.
313716_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	While customers may not purchase high cost machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment and therefore accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The two primary product groups in ATA are collets and chucks.
313716_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Collets are cone-shaped metal sleeves used for holding circular or rod-like pieces in a lathe or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	It is most commonly used to hold a rotating work piece.
313716_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	Some of our specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	While our products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We offer an extensive line of workholding and toolholding solutions that are available in thousands of shapes and sizes to meet unique customer application needs.
313716_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	These solutions can be used on virtually all types and brands of metalcutting machines, as well as non-traditional uses in many industrial applications.
313716_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand this business organically and through acquisitions.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	We sell our products in most of the industrialized countries of the world through a combination of direct sales, distributors, agents, and manufacturers' representatives.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Generally, our distributors have an exclusive right to sell our products in a defined geographic area.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Our distributors operate as independent businesses and purchase products from us at discounted prices for their customers, while agents and representatives sell products on our behalf and receive commissions on sales.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	Our discount schedule is adjusted to reflect the level of pre and post-sales support offered by our distributors.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our direct sales personnel earn a fixed salary plus commission.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S5	Sales through distributors are made only on standard commercial open account terms or through letters of credit.
313716_18_ITEM1_P39_S6	Distributors generally take title to products upon shipment from our facilities and do not have any special return privileges.
313716_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our standard ATA products are sold through direct sales, distribution, and via our web site at www.shophardinge.com.
313716_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Custom or special solutions are sold through direct sales and agents.
313716_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	In most cases, we are able to package and ship in-stock tooling, accessories, and repair parts within 24 hours of receiving orders.
313716_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	We can package and ship items with heavy demand within a few hours.
313716_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	We promote our products through advertising in trade publications, web presences, email newsletters, and participation in industry trade shows.
313716_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition, we market our non-machine products and capabilities through the publication of general catalogs and other targeted catalogs, which we distribute to existing and prospective customers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	We have a presence on the internet at www.hardinge.com and www.forkardt.com, where customers can obtain information about our products and place orders for accessories, tooling, knee mill products, and repair parts.
313716_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	A substantial portion of our end use customers are small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Industries directly and indirectly served by us include aerospace, automotive, computer, communications, consumer-electronics, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	No single customer or related group of customers accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2017 or 2016 .
313716_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	While valuing our relationship with each customer, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer, or any few customers, would have an adverse material effect on our business.
313716_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	Order backlog was $130.6 million and $117.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
313716_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	In our industry, the barriers to entry for competition vary based on the level of product performance required.
313716_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	For the products with the highest performance in terms of accuracy and productivity, the barriers are generally technical in nature.
313716_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	For basic products, the barriers are tied to product availability, competitive price position, and an effective distribution model that offers the pre and post-sales support required by customers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Another significant barrier in the global machine tool industry is the high level of working capital that is required to operate the business.
313716_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	We compete in various sectors of the machine tool market within the products of turning, milling, grinding, tooling, and accessories.
313716_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	We compete with multiple companies in each market sector we serve.
313716_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	The primary competitive factors in the marketplace for our machine tools are technical performance, reliability, price, delivery time, and service.
313716_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our management considers our segment of the industry to be extremely competitive.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	There are many manufacturers of machine tools in the world.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	They can be categorized by the size of material their products can machine and the precision level their products can achieve.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	For our high precision, multi-tasking turning and milling equipment, competition comes primarily from companies such as DMG Mori Seiki, Mazak, and Okuma.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S3	Competition in our more standard turning and milling equipment comes, in part, from those companies as well as Doosan, which is based in South Korea, and Haas, which is based in the U.S., as well as many Taiwanese companies.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our internal and outer diameter cylindrical grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by United Grinding Group, a Swiss company, as well as Toyoda and Shigiya, which are based in Japan.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S5	Our Hauser jig grinding machines compete primarily with products manufactured by Moore Tool, which is based in the U.S., and some Japanese suppliers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S6	Our surface grinding machines compete with products manufactured by Okamoto in Japan and Chevalier in Taiwan.
313716_18_ITEM1_P47_S7	Our ATA products compete with many products manufactured by a variety of small companies.
313716_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The overall number of our competitors providing product solutions serving our target markets may increase.
313716_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Also, the overall composition of companies with which we compete may change as we broaden our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve.
313716_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	In addition, several of our competitors may have greater resources, including financial, technical, and engineering resources, than we do.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our machines within the MMS segment are produced around the world.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	We produce certain of our lathes, knee mills, and related products at our Elmira, New York plant.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Kellenberger and Voumard grinding machines and related products are manufactured at our St. Gallen, Switzerland plant and Hauser and Tschudin products are produced at our Biel, Switzerland facility.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	The Jones Shipman grinding machines are currently manufactured at our Leicester, England plant.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S4	The Usach grinding machines are manufactured at our Elgin, Illinois plant.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S5	We produce machining centers and lathes at our Hardinge Taiwan facility in Nan Tou, Taiwan and our Hardinge Precision Machinery (Jiaxing) Company, Ltd. facility in Jiaxing, China.
313716_18_ITEM1_P50_S6	The Company's Forkardt and Hardinge branded ATA segment products and solutions are engineered and produced in our plants located in Traverse City, Michigan, Elmira, New York, Reutlingen, Germany, Noisy le Sec, France, Hyderabad, India and Shanghai, China.
313716_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We manufacture products from various raw materials, including cast iron, sheet metal, and bar steel.
313716_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We purchase a number of components, sub-assemblies, and assemblies from outside suppliers, including the computer and electronic components for our computer controlled lathes, grinding machines, and machining centers.
313716_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	There are multiple suppliers for virtually all of our raw material, components, sub-assemblies, and assemblies and, historically, we have not experienced a serious supply interruption.
313716_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	However, in 2011, because of the increase in demand driven by early 2011 worldwide order activity, producers of bearings, ball screws, and linear guides had difficulty meeting the rise in demand.
313716_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	Similar demand increase in the future could impact our production schedules.
313716_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	A major component of our computer controlled machines is the computer and related electronics package.
313716_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	We purchase these components from Fanuc Limited, a Japanese electronics company, Heidenhain, a German control supplier, Mitsubishi Electric, a Japanese electronics company, or from Siemens, another German control manufacturer.
313716_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	While we believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing from several other existing suppliers, and we occasionally do so for special orders, a disruption in the supply of the computer controls from one of our suppliers could cause us to experience a substantial disruption of our operations, depending on the circumstances at the time.
313716_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	We purchase parts from these suppliers under normal trade terms.
313716_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	There are no agreements with these suppliers to purchase minimum volumes per year.
313716_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our ongoing research and development program involves creating new products, modifying existing products to meet specific customer needs, and redesigning existing products, both to add new functionality and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.
313716_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our research and development departments throughout the world are staffed with experienced design engineers with varying levels of education, ranging from technical training to doctoral degrees.
313716_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	The worldwide cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operating expense, amounted to $14.5 million , $13.5 million and $14.1 million , in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
313716_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Although we hold several patents with respect to certain of our products, we do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent or group of patents.
313716_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Hardinge's business and that of the machine tool industry in general, is cyclical.
313716_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	It is not subject to significant seasonal trends.
313716_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	However, our quarterly results are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our shipments of machines, which are largely dependent upon customer delivery requirements.
313716_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	Given that a large percentage of our sales are from Asia, the impact of plant shutdowns in that region by us and our customers due to the celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday may impact the first quarter sales, income from operations, and net income, and result in the first quarter being the lowest quarter of the year.
313716_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	The ability to deliver products within a short period of time is an important competitive criterion.
313716_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We must have inventory on hand to meet customers' delivery expectations, which for standard machines typically range from immediate to eight weeks delivery.
313716_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Meeting this requirement is especially difficult with some of our products, where delivery is extended due to time associated with shipping on ocean-going vessels, depending on the location of the customer.
313716_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	This creates a need to have inventory of finished machines available in our major markets to serve our customers in a timely manner.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	We deliver many of our machine products within one to two months after the order.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	Some orders, especially multiple machine orders, are delivered on a turnkey basis with the machine or group of machines configured to make certain parts for the customer.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	This type of order often includes the addition of material handling equipment, tooling, and specific programming.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	In those cases, the customer usually observes and inspects the parts being made on the machine at our facility before shipment so the timing of the sale is dependent upon the customer's schedule and acceptance.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	Lead times for these types of orders, especially grinding machines, can range from six to eight months.
313716_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	Therefore, sales from quarter-to-quarter can vary depending upon the timing of customers' acceptances and the significance of those orders.
313716_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	We feel it is important, where practical, to provide readily available accessories and replacement parts for the machines we sell and we carry inventory at levels sufficient to meet these customer requirements.
313716_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe that our current operations and our current uses of property, plant and equipment conform in all material respects to applicable laws and regulations in the various countries in which we conduct business.
313716_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
313716_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) because of groundwater contamination.
313716_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the Site ) encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY.
313716_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ( RI/FS ) for the Koppers Pond (the Pond ) portion of the Site.
313716_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond.
313716_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond.
313716_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site.
313716_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Environmental sampling on the Company s property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence that the Company s operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination.
313716_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	A substantial portion of the Pond is located on the Company s property.
313716_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRP's"), agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006.
313716_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA.
313716_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	The PRP's also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the costs associated with the RI/FS study on a per capita basis.
313716_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008.
313716_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	In July of 2012, the PRP's submitted a Remedial Investigation ("RI") to respond to EPA issues raised in the initial draft RI.
313716_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	In January 2016, the PRP's submitted a draft Feasibility Study ("FS"), also to respond to issues raised by the EPA about previous drafts of the FS.
313716_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	In July 2016, the EPA announced its proposed remediation plan based on an alternative put forth in a July 2016 Woodruff Curran FS with an estimated total clean-up phase cost of $1.9 million.
313716_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	The preferred remedy consists of the placement of a continuous six-inch thick soil and sand cap, including a geotextile membrane to act as a demarcation layer, over the Pond.
313716_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	The preferred remedy includes long-term monitoring and institutional controls.
313716_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	RI/FS had been performed in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent, and approving the remedy selected in the FS as the final response action for the Pond.
313716_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	In June 2017, the EPA issued a Special Notice letter to the original PRP s and two new additional parties (Eaton Corporation and Elmira Water Board) requesting these PRPs to fund, undertake, and complete the remedy for the Pond.
313716_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Shortly after, the EPA provided a proposed Statement of Work for completion of the remedy ( SOW ) and the EPA agreed to waive the past response costs as defined in the RI/FS Order of Consent in full if the parties could reach a settlement with the EPA by September 30, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	In September 2017, the nine participating PRPs privately negotiated and finalized an allocation of costs amongst themselves, with 10.75% of the costs being allocated to the Company.
313716_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Based on the estimated cost of the present remedy of $1.9 million, and with credit for costs previously paid by the Company for the RI/FS, the remaining costs that have been allocated to the Company will not exceed $0.2 million.
313716_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	The Company has the entire amount reserved as of December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM1_P76_S3	This reserve is reported in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
313716_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	Based upon information currently available, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company does not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Though the foregoing reflects the Company s current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Hardinge Inc. employed 1,384 persons, 440 of whom were located in the United States.
313716_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
313716_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Information related to foreign and domestic operations and sales is included in Note 17.
313716_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	"Segment Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.
313716_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	Our strategy has been to diversify our sales and operations geographically so that the impact of economic trends in different regions can be balanced.
313716_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The risks associated with conducting business on an international basis are discussed further in Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
313716_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Current and potential shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for shareholders to consider.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to acquire the shares of Hardinge that Privet does not beneficially own in an all-cash merger transaction (the Merger ) for $18.50 per share valued at approximately $245.0 million, subject to approval of Hardinge shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our businesses may be subject to uncertainties and other operating restrictions until completion of the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Additionally, we have agreed to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs during the pendency of the Merger, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining key employees during the pendency of the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In connection with the pending Merger, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Key employees may depart because of the uncertainty or potential difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	One of the conditions to completion of the Merger is the absence of any injunctions or laws that prevents, makes illegal, or prohibits the closing of the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining a judgment prohibiting completion of the Merger, then such judgment may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected time frame.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Although we currently expect the Merger to be completed during the second quarter of 2018, the expected timing for completion of the Merger could change.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We currently expect that the Merger be completed during the second quarter of 2018.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	However, the completion of the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of required approvals and the absence of any law, judgment or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	While we believe we will receive the requisite approvals, there can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied on the proposed terms and schedules as contemplated by the parties or at all.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These and other conditions to the completion of the Merger may delay or preclude our ability to consummate the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	As a result, the Merger may not be completed until after that time, or at all, and the effect of the risks and constraints relating to the pending Merger (including those discussed in this section Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Pending Merger ) may be increased if the timing for the completion of the Merger is extended or becomes more uncertain.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs in connection with the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These costs are primarily associated with the fees of attorneys, accountants, and financial advisors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, the Company has diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the Merger and continues to do so.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The Company is also subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of the Company s business during the pendency of the Merger.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If the Merger is not completed, the Company will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred and the restrictions on the Company s conduct.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Moreover, the views of third parties as to the Company s business and prospects may be adversely impacted if the Merger is not completed, even if the reason for the failure of the Merger to be completed did not relate to the Company s business and prospects.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	These costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $8,535,000 and reimburse certain expenses of Parent up to $3,658,000 (or a termination fee of $3,658,000 and reimbursement of certain expenses up to $3,658,000 under specified conditions where the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal and enters into a definitive agreement relating to such superior proposal prior to May 13, 2018).
313716_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may decide to pay the termination fee from available cash that we would have otherwise used for general corporate purposes.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	For these and other reasons, a failed Merger could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows, or the price per share of our common stock.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If the Merger is not completed, Privet Fund LP and Privet Fund Management LLC will continue to hold a substantial number of our outstanding shares, but their investment thesis may change with respect to such share ownership.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As of March 5, 2018, Privet Fund LP and Privet Fund Management collectively hold approximately 10.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	For example, Privet Fund LP and Privet Fund Management LLC may desire to acquire more of our shares of common stock, or become more likely to sell the shares of our common stock that they already hold, compared to their intentions with respect to our shares prior to entering into the Merger Agreement (including the plans and purposes that Privet had publicly disclosed).
313716_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such a change in intention could impact the trading price of our shares or our business and results of operations or require additional time and attention of our board of directors and senior management team.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Anyone buying shares of our common stock for more than $18.50 per share is unlikely to receive more than $18.50 per share for such stock for as long as the Merger Agreement remains in effect.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Merger Agreement provides that upon consummation of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (except for shares owned by Acquisition Sub or Parent after Privet Fund LP contributes its shares to Parent), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $18.50 in cash, without interest (and less applicable withholding taxes).
313716_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	It is likely that the Merger consideration will act as a cap on the market price of our common stock until the Merger is consummated or the Merger Agreement terminated.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone selling shares of our common stock before consummation of the Merger will receive more than $18.50 per share.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Changes in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and the market price of our common shares.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:
313716_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Changes in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings, and profitability.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In 2017, approximately 71% of our products were manufactured in countries outside of North America and approximately 69% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Changes in domestic and foreign tax laws.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We cannot predict the impact of recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation on our NOLs, business or financial condition.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), was signed into law in the U.S.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Tax Act makes major changes to the Code, and includes a number of provisions that affect the taxation of corporations, such as, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, modifying the rules regarding limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, and the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system with corresponding measures to prevent base erosion.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Given that our current deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, we do not believe that the Tax Act will result in a material net change to our financial statements, although if we become more profitable, we will obtain a reduced benefit from such deferred tax assets.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We continue to examine the impact that the Tax Act will have on us and our business.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	However, because at this time the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain, the ultimate effect of the Tax Act on our business and financial condition is uncertain and could be adverse.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Prices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The availability of, and prices for, these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Some components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies, or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We maintain an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In 2017, approximately 33% of our sales were through distributors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2017.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Failure to achieve these objectives would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in commitments of significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P43_S6	In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	"Business - Environmental Matters", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology systems, as well as other cybersecurity risks and business disruptions.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third party information technology systems, which may result from attacks on or failures of such infrastructure.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Cybersecurity risks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, attacks on our information technology systems and attacks on the information technology systems of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information or information relating to our employees, customers, and other third parties.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Cybersecurity risks may also include attacks targeting the security, integrity, and/or reliability of the hardware, software, and information installed, stored, or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into our customers facilities and/or infrastructure.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Such attacks could potentially result in disruptions to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services, and operations from these potential attacks.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature, and scope of such attacks or other disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other damaging effects on our operations or our ability to provide products and services to our customers, the unintended release of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other improper use of our or third party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services could be impacted by future global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	For many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity, or use of cash flow from operations.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Instability, uncertainty, and doubt as a result of future global economic and financial conditions could reduce the cash flow of our customers and their access to credit and equity markets, which could make it difficult for our customers to commit to larger, long-term capital projects.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P51_S4	As a result, such future global economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, causing our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Major changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on customers' ability to pay.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We run the risk of bad debt with customers on open account.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal, or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Supermajority Voting Provision for Certain Business Combinations .
313716_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets, or other business combinations involving the Company.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	However, if 75% of the Continuing Directors (defined as directors who were on the Board prior to the Major Shareholder crossing the 10% beneficial ownership threshold) approve the proposed merger, sale of assets, or other business combination, then the 75% threshold does not apply.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of the Company.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Supermajority Voting Provisions for Amendment and Repeal of Bylaws .
313716_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The affirmative vote of holders representing at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of common stock must be obtained in order for shareholders to amend or repeal our bylaws.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our bylaws may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the entire Board of Directors.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the Board of Directors has already designated 250,000 of such shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock) in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.
313716_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.

313716_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
313716_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information included herein (amounts in thousands except per share data):
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	____________________ (1) In August 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program with the goals of streamlining the Company's cost structure, increasing operational efficiencies, and improving shareholder returns, which was completed in 2016.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	In March 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program with the goals of further increasing operational efficiencies and cash generation, and improving shareholder return.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	This program is expected to be completed in mid-2018.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S3	In September 2017, the Company initiated a global strategic realignment of our selling organization with a focus on unified sales channels, a simplified product offering, and the elimination of redundancies.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S4	This program is expected to be completed in 2018.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S5	(2) 2014 and 2013 results include non-cash charges of $5.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
313716_18_ITEM6_P1_S6	$5.8 million and $5.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, was related to the impairment in the value of goodwill and the trade name associated with the purchase of Usach, and $1.1 million in 2013 was related to the impairment of the Forkardt trade name as a result of the Forkardt Swiss business divestiture.
313716_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	(3) On December 31, 2013, the Company divested its Forkardt Operations in Switzerland for CHF 5.6 million, net of cash sold ($6.3 million equivalent), resulting in a gain of $4.9 million.
313716_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	In March 2014, the Company recognized $0.2 million of additional consideration as a result of final working capital adjustments.
313716_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories.
313716_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability, and value.
313716_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ( U.S. ), and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), with sales to most industrialized countries.
313716_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	Approximately 69% of our 2017 sales were to customers outside of North America, 71% of our 2017 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and 68% of our employees in 2017 were employed outside of North America.
313716_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Metrics on machine tool market activity monitored by our management include world machine tool shipments, as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report, and metal-cutting machine orders, as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers.
313716_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products.
313716_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management.
313716_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
313716_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	Similar information regarding machine tool shipments and economic indicators in foreign countries is published by trade associations, government agencies, and economic services in those countries.
313716_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts, and service revenue, accounted for approximately 32% of overall sales in 2017 and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications.
313716_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics.
313716_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ( sales ), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends.
313716_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators.
313716_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates.
313716_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.
313716_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, our bank financing arrangements, and equity financing arrangements.
313716_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
313716_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal.
313716_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
313716_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations.
313716_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The risks related to creditworthiness and non-performance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
313716_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials.
313716_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We continue to monitor our customers financial condition in order to mitigate the risk associated with our ability to collect on our accounts receivable.
313716_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons.
313716_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now, largely, manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan, which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets.
313716_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ( GBP ), Chinese Renminbi ( CNY ), Euro ( EUR ), New Taiwanese Dollar ( TWD ), and Swiss Franc ( CHF ).
313716_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Under US GAAP, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ( USD ) at the average exchange rate during the periods presented.
313716_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes.
313716_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to acquire the shares of Hardinge that Privet does not beneficially own in an all-cash merger transaction (the Merger ) for $18.50 per share valued at approximately $245.0 million, subject to approval of Hardinge shareholders and other customary closing conditions.

313716_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The current year increase reflects improved industrial market activity, with MMS up 7%, and ATA up 8% from respective prior year sales in the region.
313716_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Europe sales of $91.3 million and $91.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, were relatively flat.
313716_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	MMS was down 1%, and ATA was up 9% from respective prior year sales in the region.
313716_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The ATA increase is primarily attributed to increased sales in Europe and North America.
313716_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Favorable foreign currency translation impacted sales by approximately $0.8 million .
313716_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales would have decreased $0.9 million , or 1% , versus the prior year.
313716_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Asia sales were $126.6 million and $108.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, an increase of $18.7 million , or 17% .
313716_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted sales by approximately $0.7 million .
313716_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Excluding the translation effect, sales improved by $19.3 million , or 18% .

313716_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in gross profit was related to the increase in sales volume.
313716_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in gross margin over the prior year was due to improved volumes and lower inventory obsolescence charges, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
313716_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses were $80.0 million , or 25% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of $0.3 million , compared to $79.6 million , or 27% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
313716_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	SG A cost increase in 2017 was due to $3.0 million in higher incentive and compensation expenses, largely offset by $0.9 million in restructuring related savings, $0.9 million in reduced commission and other variable selling related expenses, and $0.3 million lower occupancy and insurance costs.
313716_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Additionally, we had $1.7 million of unusual expenses in both years.
313716_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	The year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $1.2 million of charges primarily related to our change in CEO, $0.2 million related to our strategic review process, and $0.3 million related to an ERP conversion and other project costs.

313716_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	In March 2017, management initiated a strategic restructuring program in our MMS segment.
313716_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In September 2017, we expanded our restructuring efforts in order to improve earnings by optimizing our footprint and improving operational efficiencies to reduce our cost structure.
313716_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We expect to realize total cost savings related to these programs of approximately $12.0 million to $12.5 million annually.
313716_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Both of these initiatives are expected to be substantially completed in 2018.

313716_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The 2017 tax rate was also impacted by the estimated transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) as discussed below.
313716_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continually assess all available positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740 to evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable.
313716_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	To the extent that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in a particular jurisdiction will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
313716_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	We currently maintain a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands.
313716_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
313716_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.

313716_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase in segment income was due to higher gross profit on higher sales volume, lower inventory obsolescence charges, partially offset by higher sales commissions, an unfavorable sales mix and lower overhead absorption.
313716_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increase in segment income would have been $3.2 million higher if not for higher restructuring expenses of $3.6 million in 2017, partially offset by incremental restructuring savings of $0.4 million.

313716_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	from respective prior year sales in the region.
313716_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The ATA decline is primarily attributed to the restructuring of our operations in this region.

313716_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The decrease in gross profit was related to the decrease in sales volume, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $2.4 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses were $79.6 million, or 27.3% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 2%, compared to $81.3 million, or 25.8% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015.

313716_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	Adjusting for the impacts in severance, pension settlement, strategic review related charges, and foreign currency translation, SG A would have decreased $1.2 million in the current year as compared to the prior year period.
313716_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	The decrease was due mainly to savings generated as a result of the restructuring initiatives announced in 2015 and completed in 2016.
313716_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Research Development expenses were $13.5 million, or 4.6% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $14.1 million, or 4.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015.

313716_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	We continually assess all available positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740 to evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable.
313716_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	To the extent that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in a particular jurisdiction will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
313716_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	We currently maintain a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands.

313716_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Segment income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $4.3 million below 2015 segment income.
313716_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease in segment income was due to the impact of lower sales volumes, partially offset by a $1.8 million reduction in operating expenses due in part to restructuring initiatives completed in 2016.

313716_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	We have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.
313716_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	We have not included pension obligations in the above table as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of employer contributions.

313716_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	We believe that the current available funds and credit facilities, along with internally generated funds from operations, will provide sufficient financial resources for ongoing operations throughout 2018 .
313716_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
313716_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	There were no significant changes to accounting policies in 2017.
313716_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of a number of accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
313716_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	These policies require the use of assumptions or estimates, which, if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, could result in material changes to the reported results.
313716_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	Following is a discussion of those accounting policies that were reviewed with our audit committee, and which we feel are most susceptible to such interpretation.
313716_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We assess the collectability of our trade accounts receivable using a combination of methods.
313716_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	We review large individual accounts for evidence of circumstances that suggest a collection problem might exist.
313716_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Such situations include, but are not limited to, the customer's history of payments, its current financial condition as evidenced by credit ratings, financial statements or other sources, and recent collection activities.
313716_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	We provide a reserve for losses based on current payment trends in the economies where we hold concentrations of receivables and provide a reserve for what we believe to be the most likely risk of collectability.
313716_18_ITEM7_P84_S4	In order to make these allowances, we rely on assumptions regarding economic conditions, equipment resale values, and the likelihood that previous performance will be indicative of future results.
313716_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	We use a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the value of our inventory.
313716_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	An allowance is provided for the value of inventory quantities of specific items that are deemed to be excessive based on an annual review of past usage and anticipated future usage.
313716_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	While we feel this is the most appropriate methodology for determining excess quantities, the possibility exists that customers will change their buying habits in the future should their own requirements change.
313716_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Changes in metalcutting technology can render certain products obsolete or reduce their market value.
313716_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	We continually evaluate changes in technology and adjust our products and inventory carrying values accordingly, either by write-off or by price reductions.
313716_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Changes in market conditions and realizable selling prices for our machines could reduce the value of our inventory.
313716_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	We continually evaluate the carrying value of our machine inventory against the estimated selling price, less related costs to sell and adjust our inventory carrying values accordingly.
313716_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	However, the possibility exists that a future technological development, currently unanticipated, might affect the marketability of specific products produced by the Company.
313716_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We include in the cost of our inventories a component to cover the estimated cost of manufacturing overhead activities associated with production of our products.
313716_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	We believe that being able to offer immediate delivery on many of our products is critical to our competitive success.
313716_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	Likewise, we believe that maintaining an inventory of service parts, with a particular emphasis on purchased parts, is especially important to support our policy of maintaining serviceability of our products.
313716_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	Consequently, we maintain significant inventories of repair parts on many of our machine models, some of which are no longer in production.
313716_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	Our ability to accurately determine which parts are needed to maintain this serviceability is critical to our success in managing this element of our business.
313716_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indicators of impairment are present.
313716_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
313716_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
313716_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
313716_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and/or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, etc.).
313716_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	We have two reporting units, only one of which currently has goodwill.
313716_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	Our ATA reporting unit had goodwill totaling $6.7 million as of December 31, 2017 .
313716_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance.
313716_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test.
313716_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our annual goodwill impairment review was performed as of October 1, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a result of this assessment we determined that the fair value of our reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value.
313716_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	We regularly review the recent results and projected future results of our operations, as well as other relevant factors, to reconfirm the likelihood that existing deferred tax assets in each tax jurisdiction would be fully recoverable.
313716_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	A full valuation allowance is maintained on the tax benefits of the U.S. net deferred tax assets and it is expected that a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits will be recorded until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	A valuation allowance is also maintained on the U.K., German, and Dutch deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	The calculation of the tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation, and application of complex tax laws.
313716_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Germany, France, the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, and India.
313716_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and two postretirement benefit plans, all as described in Note 13.
313716_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	"Employee Benefits" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	The calculation of our plan expenses and liabilities require the use of a number of critical accounting estimates.
313716_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	Changes in the assumptions can result in different plan expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
313716_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
313716_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	We annually review the discount rate to be used for retirement plan liabilities.
313716_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	In the U.S., we use bond pricing models based on high grade U.S. corporate bonds constructed to match the projected liability benefit payments.
313716_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our U.S. plan using rates of 3.86% and 4.39% at our plan measurement dates of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
313716_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	We discounted our future plan liabilities for our foreign plans using rates appropriate for each country, which resulted in blended rates of 0.87% and 0.89% at their measurement dates of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
313716_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	A change in the discount rate can have a significant effect on retirement plan obligations.
313716_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension obligations by approximately $13.5 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension obligations by approximately $11.2 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	A decrease of one percent in the discount rate would increase the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $20.7 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P105_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension obligations by approximately $17.2 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	A change in the discount rate can also have an effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would decrease U.S. 2018 pension expense by approximately $0.1 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would increase U.S. 2018 pension expense by approximately $0.08 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P106_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.6 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P106_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.2 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	The expected rate of return on plan assets varies based on the investment mix of each particular plan and reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in each pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability.
313716_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	We review our expected rate of return annually based upon information available to us at that time, including the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds in each market), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
313716_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption.
313716_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	For our domestic plans, the expected rate of return during fiscal 2018 is 7.50%, which is the same rate used for fiscal 2017 .
313716_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	A change in the expected return on plan assets can also have a significant effect on retirement plan expense.
313716_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	For example, a decrease of one percent would increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease U.S. pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	A decrease of one percent would increase the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	Conversely, an increase of one percent would decrease the Swiss pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
313716_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	We are currently assessing the financial impact to our consolidated financial statements of accounting guidance not yet adopted.
313716_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	For further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to Note 19.
313716_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	"New Accounting Standards" to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
313716_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
313716_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S3	The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company s ability to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S4	Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are the possibility that the proposed Merger is delayed or does not close, including due to the failure to receive required shareholder approval, the taking of governmental action (including the passage of legislation) to block the proposed Merger, the failure of Privet to obtain the equity and debt financing or other funds required to finance the proposed Merger, or the failure of other closing conditions, the possibility that the expected financial impacts will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company s entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company s ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies, and currency fluctuations.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S5	Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors.
313716_18_ITEM7_P111_S6	The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.
313716_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled "Overview" in Item 7.
313716_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of this Form 10-K.
313716_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Hardinge Inc.
313716_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hardinge Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
313716_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 9, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
313716_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
313716_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
313716_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
313716_18_ITEM8_P4_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
313716_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1984.

313716_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or "the Company") is a machine tool manufacturer, which designs and manufactures computer-numerically controlled cutting lathes, machining centers, grinding machines, collets, chucks, index fixtures, and other industrial products.
313716_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Products are sold to customers in North America, Europe, and Asia.
313716_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	A substantial portion of sales are to small and medium-sized independent job shops, which in turn sell machined parts to their industrial customers.
313716_18_ITEM8_P11_S3	Industries directly and indirectly served by the Company include: aerospace, automotive, communications, computer, construction equipment, defense, energy, farm equipment, medical equipment, recreational equipment, and transportation.
313716_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company operates through two reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	The MMS segment includes high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	The ATA segment includes products, primarily collets and chucks, that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their Hardinge or other branded machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
313716_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
313716_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
313716_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America ("US GAAP"), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
313716_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
313716_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash equivalents are highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
313716_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Occasionally, the Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations as collateral for customer deposits.
313716_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Additionally, restricted cash includes amounts due under mandatory principal reduction provisions associated with certain term debt agreements.
313716_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amount of restricted cash was approximately $2.7 million and $2.9 million , respectively.
313716_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	A review of the financial condition of the Company's customers is performed periodically through credit reviews.
313716_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	No collateral is required for sales made on open account terms.
313716_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Letters of credit from major banks back the majority of sales in the Asian region.
313716_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of customers comprising the customer base.
313716_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	Trade accounts receivable are considered to be past due when in excess of 30 days past terms, and charge off of uncollectible balances occurs when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
313716_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
313716_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.8 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
313716_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would result in additional expense to the Company.
313716_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Other current assets consist of prepaid insurance, prepaid real estate taxes, prepaid software license agreements, prepaid income taxes, and deposits on certain inventory purchases.
313716_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	When applicable, prepayments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the corresponding life of the underlying asset.
313716_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.
313716_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Elements of cost include raw materials, purchased components, labor, and overhead.
313716_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company assesses the valuation of inventory balances, and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
313716_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	The net realizable value of such inventories is estimated based on analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.
313716_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	The carrying value of inventory is also compared to the estimated selling price less costs to sell and inventory carrying value will be adjusted accordingly.
313716_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold.
313716_18_ITEM8_P23_S4	If future demand for products is less favorable than forecasts, inventories may need to be reduced, which would result in additional expense.
313716_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
313716_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Major additions, renewals, or improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.
313716_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
313716_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment could exist.
313716_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
313716_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	The reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly, whether those units constitute a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for purposes of aggregation.
313716_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company has two reporting units.
313716_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment by assessing a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance.
313716_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	If it is determined after completing this assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a step-two impairment test is performed.
313716_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
313716_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
313716_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	As part of the impairment analysis, the fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill is determined using the income approach and market approach.
313716_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the analysis is performed to determine the amount of the impairment.
313716_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of October 1, 2017 and there were no indicators of impairment.
313716_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Accordingly, the Company did not perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
313716_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	See Note 6: "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for more information.
313716_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization.
313716_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	They are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
313716_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also subject to review for impairment, if indicators of impairment are identified.
313716_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Future impairment indicators, such as declines in forecasted cash flows, may cause additional significant impairment charges.
313716_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Impairment charges could be based on such factors as the Company's stock price, forecasted cash flows, assumptions used, control premiums, or other variables.
313716_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
313716_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	To assess whether impairment exists, undiscounted cash flows are used to measure any impairment loss using discounted cash flows.
313716_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Assets to be held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
313716_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Accrued expenses include $12.8 million and $8.0 million in compensation related expenses at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, as well as $8.2 million and $7.2 million of commissions payable for December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
313716_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
313716_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.
313716_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized.
313716_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed.
313716_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	Positive and negative evidence to be considered includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
313716_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	Supporting a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary is difficult when there is negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years.
313716_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	A full valuation allowance is maintained on the tax benefits of the U.S. net deferred tax assets and it is expected that a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits will be recorded until an appropriate level of profitability in the U.S. is sustained.
313716_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	A valuation allowance is also maintained on the U.K., German, and Dutch deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards in those jurisdictions, as well as all other deferred tax assets of those entities.
313716_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The calculation of the tax liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
313716_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	The provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the U.S. and the various states, as well as federal and provincial jurisdictions in Switzerland, U.K., Germany, France, the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, and India.
313716_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
313716_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold.
313716_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
313716_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Sales are recorded net of discounts, customer sales incentives, and returns.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Discounts and customer sales incentives are typically negotiated as part of the sales terms at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	The Company does not routinely permit customers to return machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S4	In the rare case that a machine return is permitted, a restocking fee is typically charged.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S5	Returns of spare parts and workholding products are limited to a period of 90 days subsequent to purchase, excluding special orders, which are not eligible for return.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S6	An estimate of returns, which is not significant, is recorded as a reduction of revenue and is based on historical experience.
313716_18_ITEM8_P43_S7	Transfer of ownership and risk of loss are generally not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance.

313716_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	We recognized a provisional amount of $1.2 million , which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations for the reasonable estimate made with regards to the one-time transition tax.
313716_18_ITEM8_P110_S3	Any subsequent adjustments to this amount will be recorded through current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
313716_18_ITEM8_P110_S4	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
313716_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	We are still analyzing the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially impact the measurement of our tax balances.
313716_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	The substantial 2017 impacts of the enactment of the Tax Act are reflected in the tables below.
313716_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company's pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations for domestic and foreign sources is as follows (in thousands):

313716_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	The significant decrease in the valuation allowance due to operational results was primarily driven by the revaluation of the deferred tax assets of the U.S. group as a result of the change in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was enacted in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts Jobs Act discussed above.
313716_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	In 2016 , the valuation allowance decreased by $1.3 million , of which $0.4 million was due to operational results and $0.9 million of valuation allowance was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

313716_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	If recognized, essentially all of the uncertain tax positions and related interest at December 31, 2017 would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations .
313716_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	It is reasonably possible that certain uncertain tax positions pertaining to the foreign operations may change within the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.
313716_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The estimated change in uncertain tax positions for these items is estimated to be between $0.2 million and $0.9 million .
313716_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations .

313716_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	In July of 2012, the PRP's submitted a Remedial Investigation (RI) to respond to EPA issues raised in the initial draft RI.
313716_18_ITEM8_P139_S2	In January 2016, the PRP's submitted a draft Feasibility Study (FS), also to respond to issues raised by the EPA about previous drafts of the FS.

313716_18_ITEM8_P188_S2	None of the stock options outstanding are exercisable at December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	The fair market value of stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model.
313716_18_ITEM8_P189_S1	A summary of stock option activity, including assumptions used in the Black Scholes model used to calculate the fair value of stock options granted in 2017, is as follows:
313716_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	Stock options vest over a two or three -year period based on either a service period or a combination of service period and performance measures.
313716_18_ITEM8_P190_S1	Deferred compensation for stock options is amortized on a straight-line basis for stock options, which vest over a specified service period, and is recognized ratably for stock options, which also have a performance requirement to the extent that it is probable that the performance target will be met.
313716_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Company used the simplified method of calculating the expected term of of stock options as exercise data relating to stock options was not available.
313716_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	All stock options granted have a ten -year contractual term.
313716_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options at December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million , which is calculated as the difference between the stock price as of December 31, 2017 and the exercise price of the option.
313716_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	Restricted stock/units (the "RSAs") are awarded to certain employees.
313716_18_ITEM8_P194_S1	RSAs vest at the end of the service period and are subject to forfeiture as well as transfer restrictions.
313716_18_ITEM8_P194_S2	During the vesting period, the RSAs are held by the Company and the recipients are entitled to exercise rights pertaining to such shares, including the right to vote such shares.

313716_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company operates through segments for which separate financial information is available, and for which operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company's chief operating decision maker in determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
313716_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	The two reportable business segments are Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA").
313716_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	This segment includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling, as discussed below, and related repair parts.
313716_18_ITEM8_P207_S1	The products are considered to be capital goods with sales prices ranging from approximately thirty thousand dollars for some high volume products to around two million dollars for some lower volume grinding machines or other specialty built turnkey systems of multiple machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P207_S2	Sales are subject to economic cycles and, because they are most often purchased to add manufacturing capacity, the cycles can be severe with customers delaying purchases during down cycles and then aggressively requiring machine deliveries during up cycles.
313716_18_ITEM8_P207_S3	Machines are purchased to a lesser extent during down cycles as customers seek productivity improvements or they have new products that require new machining capabilities.
313716_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company engineers and sells high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	Turning Machines or lathes are power-driven machines used to remove material from either bar stock or a rough-formed part by moving multiple cutting tools against the surface of a part rotating at very high speeds in a spindle mechanism.
313716_18_ITEM8_P209_S1	The multi-directional movement of the cutting tools allows the part to be shaped to the desired dimensions.
313716_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	Management considers Hardinge to be a leader in the field of producing machines capable of consistently and cost-effectively producing parts to very close dimensions.
313716_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	Machining centers are designed to remove material from stationary, prismatic or box-like parts of various shapes with rotating tools that are capable of milling, drilling, tapping, reaming, and routing.
313716_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	Machining centers have mechanisms that automatically change tools based on commands from an integrated computer control without operator assistance.
313716_18_ITEM8_P211_S2	Machining centers are generally purchased by the same customers who purchase other Hardinge equipment.
313716_18_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Company supplies a broad line of machining centers under the Bridgeport brand name addressing a range of sizes, speeds, and powers.
313716_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	Grinding machines are used in a machining process in which a part's surface is shaped to closer tolerances with a rotating abrasive wheel or tool.
313716_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	Grinding machines can be used to finish parts of various shapes and sizes.
313716_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	The Kellenberger and Usach grinding machines are used to grind the inside and outside diameters of cylindrical parts.
313716_18_ITEM8_P212_S3	Such grinding machines are typically used to provide a more exact finish on a part that has been partially completed on a lathe.
313716_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Hauser jig grinding machines are used to make demanding contour components, primarily for tool and mold-making applications.
313716_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	The Jones Shipman brand is a line of high quality grinder (surface, creepfeed, and cylindrical) machines used by a wide range of industries.
313716_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	Voumard machines are high quality internal diameter cylindrical grinding systems.
313716_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	This segment includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	The prices of units are relatively low per piece with prices ranging from forty dollars on high volume collets to two hundred thousand dollars or more for specialty chucks, and they typically are considered to be a fairly consumable, but durable, product.
313716_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company's products are used on all types and brands of machine tools, not limited to Hardinge Brand machines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	Sales levels are affected by manufacturing cycles, but not as severely as capital goods lines.
313716_18_ITEM8_P217_S1	While customers may not purchase large dollar machines during a down cycle, their factories are operating with their existing equipment, and accessories are still needed as they wear out or they are needed for a change in production requirements.
313716_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	The two primary product groups are collets and chucks.
313716_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	Collets are cone-shaped, metal sleeves used for holding circular, or rod like pieces in a lathe, or other machine that provide effective part holding and accurate part location during machining operations.
313716_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	Chucks are a specialized clamping device used to hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylindrical object.
313716_18_ITEM8_P220_S1	A chuck is most commonly used to hold a rotating tool or a rotating work piece.
313716_18_ITEM8_P220_S2	Some of the specialty chucks can also hold irregularly shaped objects that lack radial symmetry.
313716_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	While the Company's products are known for accuracy and durability, they are consumable in nature.
313716_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	Segment income is measured for internal reporting purposes by excluding corporate expenses, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes.
313716_18_ITEM8_P222_S1	Corporate expenses consist primarily of executive employment costs, certain professional fees, and costs associated with the Company s global headquarters.

313716_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	____________________ (1) Due to the changes in outstanding shares from quarter to quarter, the total earnings per share of the four quarters may not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act (the Act ) was passed.
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S1	Due to the significant complexity of the Act, the Securities Exchange Commission has issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118 ) to provide companies additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform.
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S2	Under SAB 118, companies are required to record those items where analysis is complete, include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where analysis is incomplete, and if reasonable estimates cannot be made, record items under the previous tax law.
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S3	Companies are required to have their analysis completed within one year.
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S4	We have not completed our analysis for the tax effects related to the Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate and have recorded additional tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $1.2 million .
313716_18_ITEM8_P232_S5	Future adjustments will be recorded through current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 in which the analysis is completed.

313716_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.
313716_18_ITEM8_P234_S1	The changes to the definition of a business in this guidance will likely result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions and would also affect the accounting for disposal transactions.
313716_18_ITEM8_P234_S2	The new guidance is effective in 2018.
313716_18_ITEM8_P234_S3	The Company is evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the financial statements.

313716_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
313716_18_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
313716_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
313716_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

313716_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	Urs Baumgartner-Vice President-Grinding and CEO at Kellenberger Co.
313716_18_ITEM11_P5_S1	Mr. Baumgartner has served as an executive officer of Hardinge since 2016.
313716_18_ITEM11_P5_S2	In February 2018, Mr Baumgartner was appointed President, Europe.
313716_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	Mr. Sepanik has served as an executive officer of Hardinge since 2014.
313716_18_ITEM11_P6_S1	In February 2018, Mr. Sepanik was appointed President, Americas.
313716_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	James P. Langa-Former Senior Vice President-Machine Solutions.
313716_18_ITEM11_P7_S1	Mr. Langa served as an executive officer of Hardinge since 2009.
313716_18_ITEM11_P7_S2	In 2017, the Company eliminated the position of Senior Vice President-Machine Solutions.
313716_18_ITEM11_P7_S3	In conjunction with the foregoing action, Mr. Langa's employment with the Company was terminated, effective August 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	Messrs. Dougherty and Simons are named executive officers based on their position as our Chief Executive Officer during 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P8_S1	Mr. Malone is a named executive officer based on his position as our Chief Financial Officer.
313716_18_ITEM11_P8_S2	Messrs. Bahr, Baumgartner, and Sepanik are named executive officers by reason of being three of the Company s most highly compensated executive officers other than its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer who were serving as executive officers as of December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P8_S3	Mr. Langa is a named executive officer due to the fact that disclosure would have had to have been provided for him, but for the fact that he was not serving as an executive officer as of December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	To supplement the information presented in the compensation tables and other data presented in this Annual Report, the following is an overview and analysis of our compensation programs and policies for our named executive officers.
313716_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Board of Directors, designs, establishes, and oversees the Company's compensation programs and compensation philosophy.
313716_18_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Compensation Committee establishes all elements of compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer and reviews and approves all elements of compensation paid to our executive officers.
313716_18_ITEM11_P10_S2	In targeting increased shareholder value, our guiding compensation principles endeavor to align executive compensation with the Company's strategic objectives and financial performance.
313716_18_ITEM11_P10_S3	We believe it is in our shareholders' interests to attract, motivate, and retain highly qualified individuals in critical positions by providing competitive compensation opportunities.
313716_18_ITEM11_P10_S4	Additionally, we believe that it is critical that we retain the ability to override generic policy statements with specific compensation programs that address evolving concerns in a rapidly changing market.
313716_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	As a baseline, we believe that, at target performance, our total compensation package for each executive, as well as the individual components of the package, should approximate the median (i.e., the 50th percentile) of our comparative framework.
313716_18_ITEM11_P11_S1	To the extent that the Company performs beyond expectations, executives have the opportunity, through the performance components of our pay program, to earn above-median compensation.
313716_18_ITEM11_P11_S2	We believe that incentive compensation earned by our executives should be consistent with the Company's goal of ensuring accuracy with respect to its financial statements and encouraging ethical behavior.
313716_18_ITEM11_P11_S3	Accordingly, the Board of Directors has adopted a recoupment policy that is applicable to all incentive compensation earned by our executive officers which was determined based wholly or in part on the value of the Company's financial results or the achievement of specified performance measures.
313716_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our compensation philosophy emphasizes pay for performance.
313716_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	The Compensation Committee believes that the performance goals we set for our executive officers should be challenging and aligned with the Company's strategic objectives.
313716_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Compensation Committee has engaged Radford, a subsidiary of Aon Hewitt, as its independent compensation consultant.
313716_18_ITEM11_P13_S1	Radford is assigned projects directly by the Compensation Committee.
313716_18_ITEM11_P13_S2	In February 2016, Radford provided the Compensation Committee with a letter which sets forth updates concerning changes in the compensation market in the 2016 calendar year as compared to the 2015 calendar year.
313716_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	Compensation for the named executive officers is generally comprised of the following elements, each of which is discussed in more detail below:
313716_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	Restricted stock and options, which vest over a multi-year period.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	We benchmark our executive compensation programs against a specific group of peer companies (using compensation information reported in their proxy statements) supplemented by published compensation surveys and various other sources such as executive search firms and published industry data.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S1	Our use of these sources is incorporated into the subjective determination regarding the total compensation packages for our executive officers and principally serves to ensure that determinations made regarding these compensation packages are consistent with general compensation trends and compensation arrangements for executives at similarly situated companies.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S2	We also compare our executive compensation programs to policies and practices of other companies.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S3	We refer to these other companies as our "peer group" for executive compensation purposes.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S4	The companies included in our peer group were selected based on comparability to Hardinge with respect to market capitalization, sales, manufactured products, and international presence.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S5	The peer group being used by the Compensation Committee based on the 2015 study by Radford consisted of the following companies: Altra Holdings, Inc., Cohu, Inc., Columbus McKinnon Corp., Dynamic Materials Corporation, Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Global Power Equipment Group Inc., Hurco Companies Inc., Kadant Inc., Nanometrics Inc., NN, Inc., Rudolph Technologies, Inc., Sifco Industries, Inc., Transcat, Inc and Twin Disc, Incorporated.
313716_18_ITEM11_P16_S6	A review of peer companies is expected to be part of the 2018 independent compensation consultant review in the third quarter of 2018.
313716_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	Finally, we evaluate the relativity of compensation among our executive officers with a view to ensure that differences properly reflect differences in title, job responsibilities, performance, and seniority.
313716_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	The Compensation Committee evaluates compensation matters involving our executive officers.
313716_18_ITEM11_P18_S1	Under the Company's Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee recommends long term incentive stock-based awards, which will be subject to ratification by the Board of Directors.
313716_18_ITEM11_P18_S2	With respect to all other executive compensation, the Compensation Committee recommends action, as appropriate, to the independent directors.
313716_18_ITEM11_P18_S3	The Chief Executive Officer plays an active role in preparing information for the Compensation Committee's review and in preparing recommendations for the consideration of the Compensation Committee and the independent directors.
313716_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	For the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, the Compensation Committee evaluates, establishes, and recommends to the independent directors the base salary and targets and awards under the Cash Incentive Plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P19_S1	The Chief Executive Officer contributes to the establishment of both short term and other performance goals and objectives; however, the Compensation Committee independently assesses, and adjusts as appropriate, all performance goals and objectives before referring them to the independent directors for approval.
313716_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	The Chief Executive Officer is not present during the Compensation Committee's deliberations of its recommendations to the independent directors with respect to the Chief Executive Officer's and other executive officers' compensation.
313716_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	The significant components of our compensation program for executive officers include base salary, short term incentive bonus, long term incentive stock-based awards, non-qualified deferred compensation, and other benefits.
313716_18_ITEM11_P22_S0	Base salary is a fixed, cash component of compensation, which is reviewed and adjusted annually.
313716_18_ITEM11_P22_S1	The goal of this component is to provide Company executives with a stable, market-competitive base of income that is commensurate with an executive's skills, experience, and contributions to the Company.
313716_18_ITEM11_P23_S0	Short term incentive bonus is an annual cash bonus under the Company's Cash Incentive Plan that is fully at risk for the executives.
313716_18_ITEM11_P24_S0	Long-term incentive stock-based awards, issued under the Company's Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan, can have up to three elements: restricted shares, performance share units and stock options.
313716_18_ITEM11_P24_S1	Time-vesting restricted shares and stock options are primarily intended to retain executives by providing a compelling incentive for the participating executives to remain with the Company.
313716_18_ITEM11_P24_S2	Restricted shares and stock options also allow the Company to tie a portion of an executive's total compensation directly to increase in share value.
313716_18_ITEM11_P25_S0	Performance share units and performance-vesting options are intended to motivate executives to set and achieve long range strategic plans that improve the structural performance of the business and increase its intrinsic value over a multi-year period.
313716_18_ITEM11_P25_S1	Performance share units and performance-vesting options vest only if the executive remains with the Company through the performance period and achieves the performance criteria specified by the Compensation Committee.
313716_18_ITEM11_P25_S2	Restricted shares and time-vesting options vest over time periods that are generally longer than the vesting periods for performance share units and performance-vesting options.
313716_18_ITEM11_P26_S0	In any given year, the Compensation Committee may elect to grant restricted shares, performance share units, stock options, a combination thereof, or the Compensation Committee may elect not to make any long-term incentive stock-based awards, depending on the Compensation Committee's assessment of Company performance, business conditions, strategic goals and plans, executive retention risk, and aggregate holdings by executive participants in the plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S0	The Hardinge Inc. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan has two purposes: to offset statutory limits imposed on an executive as a participant in the Company's defined contribution retirement plan, and to provide an additional incentive for retention in cases of executives with long standing company service.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2017, Messrs. Dougherty and Malone were the only named executive officers actively participating in the plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S2	Messrs. Simons and Langa are no longer active participants in the plan due to their terminations of employment.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S3	Mr. Bahr was invited to participate in the plan in 2018.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S4	Under the terms of that plan, elective deferrals of compensation are fully vested upon contribution of such funds.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S5	Contributions to the plan that are made by the Company for the benefit of executives in 2017 were also fully vested upon contribution.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S6	The plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P27_S7	Although plan contributions are invested in accordance with elections made by executives in the plan, all contributions and investment earnings remain the property of the Company.
313716_18_ITEM11_P28_S0	Miscellaneous other benefits include company car usage.
313716_18_ITEM11_P28_S1	The primary purposes of these benefits are to recruit qualified candidates to the generally rural locations of the Company's facilities, enhance the attractiveness of these locations, and to provide convenient forums in which Company executives can meet and build good relations with customers and visitors.
313716_18_ITEM11_P29_S0	The Compensation Committee recognizes that incentive compensation provisions should be consistent with the Company's goals of ensuring financial statement accuracy and encouraging ethical behavior.
313716_18_ITEM11_P29_S1	Accordingly, in February 2015, the Board of Directors, following the recommendation of the members of the Compensation Committee, approved a recoupment policy for all incentive compensation that is paid or awarded to executive officers, effective with performance cycles beginning in 2015 and thereafter.
313716_18_ITEM11_P30_S0	This policy applies in cases where the Compensation Committee determines that the amount of any incentive compensation paid to executive officers during the three-year period preceding the date of restatement of financial statements exceeded the amount that would have been paid based on the restated financial results, and the restatement resulted from the Company's material noncompliance, due in whole or part to intentional fraud or ethical misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws.
313716_18_ITEM11_P30_S1	Under those circumstances, the Compensation Committee shall determine whether the Company should recover the difference between the compensation awarded to the affected executive officers and the compensation that would have been paid on the restated financial results for each affected executive officer.
313716_18_ITEM11_P30_S2	The Committee believes that the penalties imposed for misconduct under this policy are consistent with the goals of ensuring financial statement accuracy and encouraging ethical behavior.
313716_18_ITEM11_P31_S0	Our guiding compensation principles endeavor to align executive compensation with the Company's strategic objectives and financial performance.
313716_18_ITEM11_P31_S1	We use a comparative framework to define specific peer companies and data sources to be used in an annual compensation assessment.
313716_18_ITEM11_P32_S0	Compensation positioning is used to assess pay levels and pay mix of executive compensation.
313716_18_ITEM11_P32_S1	The market 50 th percentile is used to target level of pay for all three primary compensation components (i.e., base salary, annual cash incentive bonus, and long-term equity-based incentives) so that each comprise a meaningful portion of the total compensation for executive officers.
313716_18_ITEM11_P33_S0	For the 2017 annual cash incentive bonus program, 75% of the target award is paid only if defined financial targets are met, and up to 25% is payable based upon the achievement of individual objectives established for the executive.
313716_18_ITEM11_P33_S1	Long-term incentive compensation awards have two components: (i) 50% is made up of performance share units that are awarded only if the Company's financial performance meets defined targets and the executive remains employed through the end of the performance period, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) 50% is made up of restricted shares that vest over a defined number of years, thus enhancing executive retention.
313716_18_ITEM11_P34_S0	Annually, we include in our proxy statement a non-binding advisory shareholder vote to approve the executive compensation policies and practices as described in the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis, accompanying tables and related narrative set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
313716_18_ITEM11_P35_S0	Last year, at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders voted their approval of the compensation of our executive compensation policies and practices, with approximately 96% of the votes cast.
313716_18_ITEM11_P35_S1	The Compensation Committee has considered the results of this advisory vote in determining the Company's executive compensation policies and practices for 2017, and has determined that these policies and practices are and have been appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at this time.
313716_18_ITEM11_P36_S0	On February 27, 2017, the Board of Directors increased the salary of Mr. Malone.
313716_18_ITEM11_P36_S1	Data supplied to the Board of Directors by Radford in February 2016 on 2015 competitive market salaries was considered in connection with such determination.
313716_18_ITEM11_P36_S2	Mr. Baumgartner's position was not included in the 2015 market data that was provided to the Board of Directors.
313716_18_ITEM11_P37_S0	Effective as of February 1, 2016 Actual amount was paid to Mr. Baumgartner in Swiss Francs and the amount reflected above is based on a conversion rate of $1.022 per Swiss Franc, the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P38_S0	On February 27, 2017, the independent members of the Board of Directors, accepting the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, adopted terms for 2017 cash incentive compensation (the "2017 Plan") for the Company's executive officers under the Cash Incentive Plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P38_S1	The 2017 Plan provides incentive bonuses payable in cash to the Company's executive officers based on the Company's performance against specified financial performance goals and other objectives recommended by the Compensation Committee and set by the independent members of the Board each year.
313716_18_ITEM11_P38_S2	The Compensation Committee approves payments, if any, after the end of the year.
313716_18_ITEM11_P39_S0	As provided in the 2017 Plan, target awards for each executive officer are expressed as a percentage of the executive officer's annual base salary.
313716_18_ITEM11_P39_S1	The 2017 target awards were as follows: Mr. Dougherty, 100%; Mr. Simons, 75%; Mr. Malone; 50%; Mr. Bahr, 50%; Mr. Langa, 50%; Mr. Sepanik 50%; and Mr. Baumgartner, 50%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P40_S0	(the "EBITDA Goal") and (b) managed working capital (expressed as a percentage of annualized sales) (the "Managed Working Capital Goal").
313716_18_ITEM11_P40_S1	Each such executive officer was eligible to earn the percentages of the target award referenced in the table below based on the performance (i.e., if the threshold level is achieved, if the target level is achieved or if the maximum level is achieved) with respect to the EBITDA Goal and Managed Working Capital Goal:
313716_18_ITEM11_P41_S0	With respect to the awards made to the executive officers pursuant to the 2017 Plan, the incentive targets as a percentage of salary remained constant in comparison to the terms adopted for the Company's 2016 incentive compensation program for executives (the "2016 Program"), except for Mr. Simons whose target increased from 70% to 75%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P41_S1	Messrs. Dougherty and Bahr joined the Company in 2017 and were awarded targets of 100% and 50% of annual base salary, respectively.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S0	The EBITDA Goal and the Managed Working Capital Goal for the 2017 Program were set at $18.1 million and 37.1% of annualized sales, respectively.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S1	These goals were based on the 2017 annual operating plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S2	With respect to the EBITDA Goal, the actual Company performance was $23.6 million.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S3	This level of EBITDA resulted in the maximum achievement level of 100%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S4	With respect to the Managed Working Capital Goal, the actual Company performance was 37.7% of annual sales.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S5	This level of Managed Working Capital achieved slightly less than target and resulted in a 19.37% achievement.
313716_18_ITEM11_P42_S6	These awards were made to Mr. Malone, and on a pro rata basis to Messrs. Dougherty, Bahr and Langa based on percent of salary earned in 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P43_S0	Mr. Sepanik was eligible to earn the percentages of the target award referenced in the table below based on the performance (i.e., if the threshold level was achieved, if the target was achieved, or if the maximum level was achieved) with respect to (a) the EBITDA Goal, (b) the Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ("ATA") segment earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (the "ATA EBITDA Goal"), and (c) the managed working capital for the ATA segment (expressed as percentage of annualized sales) (the "ATA Managed Working Capital Goal"):
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S0	The EBITDA goal was set at $18.1 million, and actual achievement was $23.3 million.
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S1	This level of EBITDA resulted in the maximum achievement of 100%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S2	With respect to the ATA EBITDA Goal, actual performance was $13.4 million.
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S3	The target performance level for this goal was $11.2 million, so the percentage of the award based on the ATA EBITDA Goal was 66.01%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S4	With respect to the ATA Managed Working Capital Goal, actual performance was 23.8%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P44_S5	The target performance level for this goal was 23.2%, accordingly, the percentage of the target award based on the ATA Managed Working Capital Goal was 19.37% for Mr. Sepanik.
313716_18_ITEM11_P45_S0	Mr. Baumgartner was eligible to earn the percentages of the target award referenced in the table below based on the performance (i.e., if the threshold level was achieved, if the target was achieved, or if the maximum level was achieved with respect to (a) the EBITDA Goal, (b) the Grinding operations earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (the "Grinding EBITDA Goal"), and (iii) managed working capital for the Grinding operations (expressed as a percentage of annual sales) (the "Grinding Managed Working Capital Goal").

313716_18_ITEM11_P46_S1	This level of EBITDA resulted in the maximum achievement of 100%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P46_S2	With respect to the Grinding EBITDA Goal, actual performance was $9.6 million.
313716_18_ITEM11_P46_S3	The target performance level for this goal was $6.0 million, accordingly, the percentage of the award based on the Grinding EBITDA results was the maximum of 80%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P46_S4	With respect to the Grinding Managed Working Capital, actual performance was 38.5%.
313716_18_ITEM11_P46_S5	The target performance level for this goal was 45.2%, accordingly, the percentage of the award based on the Grinding Managed Working Capital Results was the maximum of 50% for Mr. Baumgartner.
313716_18_ITEM11_P47_S0	The Compensation Committee retains full discretion to award or withhold incentive compensation in an amount up to 25% of an executive officer's target award, regardless of whether the Company's performance against the performance goals, and full discretion to reduce, but not increase, any award otherwise determined by the Company's performance against the performance goals.
313716_18_ITEM11_P48_S0	On February 13, 2018, the independent members of the Company's Board of Directors, accepting the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, approved the payments to Messrs. Dougherty, Malone, Bahr, Langa, Sepanik, and Baumgartner under the 2017 Plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P49_S0	Set forth below are the incentive payments that were awarded to each of the executives pursuant to the 2017 Plan on February 28, 2018.
313716_18_ITEM11_P50_S0	(1) The payment made to Mr. Baumgartner as reflected in the table above was paid in Swiss Francs (Mr. Baumgartner received CHF 233,750) and, for purposes of the table above, such amount has been converted into U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.022 per Swiss Franc, the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P51_S0	On February 27, 2017, the Board of Directors, ratifying the determination of the Compensation Committee, approved restricted common stock awards to certain of our executive officers of the Company pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P51_S1	As noted below, certain of our named executive officers received an award of restricted shares which vest on the third anniversary of the date of the award.
313716_18_ITEM11_P51_S2	Each of the awards is structured such that the recipient will not vest in any portion of the restricted shares awarded until the third anniversary of the date of the award except in the event of a Change in Control or as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
313716_18_ITEM11_P51_S3	All of the awards are subject to forfeiture and accelerated vesting in accordance with the terms of the Company s Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan and the award agreement.
313716_18_ITEM11_P51_S4	Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Langa's restricted stock awards were forfeited upon his separation of employment in August 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P52_S0	On February 27, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company, ratifying the determination of the Compensation Committee, approved awards of Performance Share Units to certain of the executive officers of the Company pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan.
313716_18_ITEM11_P52_S1	The awards are contingent upon Hardinge s earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization in three one-year periods (each a Target Period and the corresponding performance goal in each Target Period, a Performance Goal ).
313716_18_ITEM11_P52_S2	Under the terms of Mr. Langa's agreement, 1,522 of his performance share awards were eligible to remain outstanding to vest, and 5,328 were forfeited when he separated employment in August 2017.
313716_18_ITEM11_P53_S0	The Performance Share Unit target awards over the aggregate three-year period (each, a Target Award ) for the Company s executive officers are as follows:
313716_18_ITEM11_P54_S0	If the Company attains or surpasses the Performance Goal target in a particular Target Period, then each executive officer will receive one-third of his Target Award attributable to the corresponding Target Period.
313716_18_ITEM11_P54_S1	On February 13, 2018, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, determined that the awards for the 2017 target period were earned.
313716_18_ITEM11_P54_S2	The Target Awards (or portions thereof) earned by each executive officer are payable at the end of the three-year vesting period in accordance with the terms of the Company s Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Stock Plan and the award agreement.

313716_18_ITEM11_P174_S0	As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President (our CEO ):
313716_18_ITEM11_P175_S0	For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:
313716_18_ITEM11_P176_S0	Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our two CEOs, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 46 to 1.
313716_18_ITEM11_P177_S0	We selected October 1, 2017 (the determination date ), which is within the last three months of 2017, as the date upon which we would identify the median employee.
313716_18_ITEM11_P178_S0	We identified the median employee by examining the total earnings, including salary, bonus and benefits, of each individual other than the CEO who was employed by us on the determination date.
313716_18_ITEM11_P178_S1	We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis.
313716_18_ITEM11_P178_S2	We believe the use of total salary, bonus and benefits for all employees is a consistently applied compensation.
313716_18_ITEM11_P179_S0	Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $45,018.
313716_18_ITEM11_P180_S0	During 2017, we had two CEOs, as described above, Messrs. Simons and Dougherty.
313716_18_ITEM11_P181_S0	We have elected to calculate the pay ratio using the total annual CEO compensation by aggregating the total compensation provided to each person who served as CEO during the year for the time the person served as CEO.
313716_18_ITEM11_P181_S1	The aggregate is the total of our two CEOs, as reported in the Total column (column (j)) of our Summary Compensation Table included in this Form 10-K and annualized that amount.

313716_18_ITEM13_P0_S0	The Company recognizes that transactions between the Company and its directors or executives can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Company decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
