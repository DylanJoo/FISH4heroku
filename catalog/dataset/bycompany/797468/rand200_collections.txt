797468_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects Occidental s results of operations.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Occidental s financial results typically correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Changes in consumption patterns, global and local economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC, currency exchange rates, market speculation, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, weather, geophysical and technical limitations and other matters may affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas, contributing to price volatility.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Demand and, consequently, the price obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economy, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Occidental s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Growth in Occidental s oil and gas production and results of operations depends, in part, on its ability to profitably acquire, develop or find additional reserves.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Occidental replaces significant amounts of its reserves through acquisitions, exploration and large development projects.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which are: (i) larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of expected reserve replacement efforts.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	During periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Occidental faces risks associated with its mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Occidental's merger, acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less than expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as product prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market's evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Governmental actions, political instability and labor unrest may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	refusal or delay in the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Occidental may experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There has been recent political instability and civil unrest in Bahrain, Libya and Yemen.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The effect, if any, of these developments on Occidental's operations is unknown at this time, but is not expected to be material.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Calculations of oil and gas reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including decline rates, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If Occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Occidental may experience significant losses in exploration activities or delays in development efforts or cost overruns.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Exploration and development activities are subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Occidental bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to equipment failures, approval delays, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, border disputes and other associated risks in its development efforts.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Concerns about climate change may affect Occidental s operations.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There is an ongoing effort to assess and quantify the effects of climate change and the potential human influences on climate.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal government and the states of California and New Mexico, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources, and such measures are pending in other jurisdictions.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	However, Occidental could face risks of delays in development projects, increases in costs and taxes and reductions in the demand for and restrictions on the use of its products as a result of ongoing GHG reduction efforts.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The occurrence of events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases and industrial accidents, and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed, may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and communities in which it operates.
797468_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	In May 2010, a putative stockholder action, Resnik v. Abraham, was filed in the U.S. District Court (Delaware), naming the present directors, certain executive officers and Occidental, as defendants.
797468_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleges defendants made a false and misleading proxy solicitation in connection with re-approval of the performance goals for certain incentive awards and authorized excessive compensation constituting corporate waste and breach of fiduciary duties.
797468_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	In July and August 2010, second and third purported stockholder complaints, Gusinsky v. Irani and Wein v. Irani , respectively, alleging similar derivative claims for corp orate waste and breach of fiduciary duty, were filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
797468_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	The parties in the Resnik case reached an agreement in principle, providing for the settlement of that action in October 2010.
797468_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The plaintiffs in the Gusinsky and Wein matters filed objections to the Resnik settlement in November 2010.
797468_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	In December 2010, Occidental reached an agreement with those plaintiffs to resolve their objections and filed a revised notice of settlement with the court on December 27, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	At a fairness hearing on February 8, 2011, the settlement was approved.
797468_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	As a result, the Wein and Gusinsky plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their cases with prejudice.
797468_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In a previously disclosed proceeding, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) has proposed a penalty of approximately $370,000 for an alleged release of production fluids from a well site.
797468_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	The current term of employment of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 6, 2011 organizational meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by 35,577 stockholders of record at December 31, 2010, and by approximately 537,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The quarterly financial data, which are included in this report after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The quarterly dividends declared on the common stock were $0.33 per share for the first quarter of 2010 and $0.38 for the last three quarters of 2010 ($1.47 for the year).
797468_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	On February 10, 2011, a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share ($1.84 on an annualized basis) was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2011 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2011.
797468_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	All of Occidental's equity compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors, pursuant to which options, rights or warrants or other equity awards may be granted, have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	Occidental has established several Plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards in the form of options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, total shareholder return incentives and dividend equivalents.
797468_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	These include the 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (1995 ISP), 2001 Incentive Compensation Plan (2001 ICP), Phantom Share Unit Awards Plan and the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2005 LTIP).
797468_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	No further awards will be granted under the 1995 ISP and 2001 ICP; however, certain 1995 ISP and 2001 ICP award grants were outstanding at December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2005 LTIP.
797468_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following is a summary of the shares reserved for issuance as of December 31, 2010, pursuant to outstanding options, rights or warrants or other equity awards granted under Occidental s equity compensation plans:
797468_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 285,340 shares at maximum payout level (142,670 at target level) reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding performance stock awards, 3,561 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to restricted stock unit awards and 3,834,537 shares at maximum payout level (2,041,022 at target or mid-point level) reserved for issuance pursuant to total stockholder return incentive awards.
797468_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	Of the 48,941,557 shares that are not reserved for issuance under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approximately 9 million to 28 million shares are available for issuance, depending on the type of award, after giving effect to the provision of the plan that each award, other than options and stock appreciation rights, must be counted against the number of shares available for issuance as three shares for every one share covered by the award.
797468_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 were as follows:
797468_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	Purchased from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan.
797468_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	Occidental has had a 95 million share authorization in place since 2008 for its share repurchase program; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s peer groups over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM5_P12_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested in Occidental common stock, in the stock of the companies in the S P 500 and in separate portfolios of each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values each year and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	In 2010, Occidental revised its current peer group beyond the 9 companies (including Occidental) in the prior peer group to provide a broader comparison basis for Occidental's results within the oil and gas industry.
797468_11_ITEM5_P13_S1	Occidental's prior peer group consisted of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, BP p.l.c., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM5_P13_S2	Occidental's current peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	Note : Argentine operations have been reflected as held for sale for all periods.
797468_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	A section of this report and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions and dispositions, discontinued operations and other items affecting comparability.
797468_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Represent amounts attributable to common stock after deducting noncontrolling interest amounts of $72 million in 2010, $51 million in 2009, $116 million in 2008, $75 million in 2007 and $111 million in 2006.
797468_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	Amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders on August 1, 2006.
797468_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end total shares of common stock outstanding, net of shares held as treasury stock, by the year-end closing stock price.
797468_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), and/or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries).
797468_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three industry segments operated by OPC's subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops, produces and markets crude oil, including natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate (together with NGLs, "liquids"), as well as natural gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls and other chemicals.
797468_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, treats, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets crude oil, liquids, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	It also trades around its assets, including pipelines and storage capacity, and trades oil and gas, other commodities and commodity-related securities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Unless otherwise indicated hereafter, discussion of oil or oil and liquids refers to crude oil, NGLs and condensate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.
797468_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Manage the midstream and marketing segment to generate returns in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Occidental prefers to own large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective production in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital.
797468_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above-cost-of-capital returns through their life cycle.
797468_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Occidental expects to use most of any excess cash flow after capital expenditures to enhance stockholders' returns through dividend increases and acquisition opportunities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy but to generate cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements.
797468_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Capital is employed to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The midstream and marketing segment is managed to generate returns on capital invested in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	In marketing its own production and third party purchases, Occidental attempts to maximize realized prices and margins and limit credit risk exposure.
797468_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	In commodities and commodity-related securities trading, Occidental seeks to generate gains using net long positions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Capital is employed to operate segment assets in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The oil and gas business seeks to increase its oil and gas production profitably and add new reserves at a pace ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development.
797468_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by:
797468_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures with an emphasis on transactions at attractive prices.
797468_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within its core areas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	In December 2010, Occidental executed an agreement with a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) to sell its Argentine oil and gas operations for after-tax proceeds of approximately $2.6 billion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The sale closed in February 2011.
797468_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	In January 2011, Occidental completed the acquisition of gas producing properties in South Texas for approximately $1.8 billion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	In December 2010, Occidental acquired approximately 174,000 net contiguous acres of oil producing and prospective properties in North Dakota, which also offer significant further development opportunity, for approximately $1.4 billion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	In 2010, Occidental also acquired various domestic oil and gas interests that complement its existing portfolio of assets for approximately $2.8 billion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	These assets are in operated, producing and non-producing properties in the Permian Basin, mid-continent region and California.
797468_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	The acquisitions mentioned above collectively are expected to offset the Argentine production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	In addition, Occidental continues to deploy significant capital to its core operations in the Permian Basin, California and mid-continent region to increase production from these assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Internationally, Occidental announced in January 2011 that it had reached an agreement-in-principle for a 40-percent participating interest in the Shah Field development project in Abu Dhabi, partnering with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.
797468_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	In January of 2010, Occidental and its partners signed a technical service contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field in Iraq.
797468_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Agreement (DPSA) with the National Oil and Gas Authority of Bahrain for further development of the Bahrain Field.
797468_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The DPSA became effective in December 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	In addition, Occidental has continued to make capital expenditures and investments in existing projects in the Middle East/North Africa and expects continued production growth in the Mukhaizna project in Oman.
797468_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	OxyChem s strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, both of which are marketed to third parties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
797468_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls permits it to maximize the benefits of integration and allows it to take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The midstream and marketing segment is managed to generate returns on capital invested in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	In order to generate these returns, the segment provides low cost services to other segments as well as to third parties and operates gas plants, oil, gas and CO 2 pipeline systems and storage facilities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	In addition, the marketing and trading group markets Occidental's and third-party oil and gas, trades around the midstream and marketing segment assets and engages in commodities and commodity-related securities trading.
797468_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	In December 2010, Occidental purchased additional interests in the General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains Pipeline), and now owns approximately 35 percent of the General Partner.
797468_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In December 2010, Occidental also completed its acquisition of the remaining 50-percent joint venture interest in Elk Hills Power, LLC (EHP), a limited liability company that operates a gas-fired power-generation plant in California, bringing Occidental s total ownership to 100 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below-average debt levels, delivering returns in excess of its cost of capital and achieving top-quartile performance compared to its peers in:
797468_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Other segment-specific measures such as per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development cost, reserves replacement percentage and others.
797468_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Over the years, Occidental has delivered high levels of return.
797468_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Occidental increased stockholder's equity by 11 percent for 2010 and 42 percent for the three-year period from 2008 to 2010 while continuing to deliver above cost of capital returns.
797468_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	During the three-year period from 2008 to 2010, Occidental increased its dividend rate by 52 percent while its stock price increased by 27 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The ROE and ROCE for 2010 were calculated by dividing Occidental's 2010 net income attributable to common stock (taking into account cost of capital for ROCE) by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, during 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The three-year average ROE and ROCE were calculated by dividing Occidental's average net income attributable to common stock (taking into account cost of capital for ROCE) over the three-year period 2008-2010 by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, over the same period.
797468_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Occidental s year-end 2010 total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 14 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Occidental issued $2.6 billion of senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Occidental s long-term senior unsecured debt was rated A by Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poor s Ratings and DBRS.
797468_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Occidental s long-term unsecured debt was rated A2 by Moody s Investors Service.
797468_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
797468_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short and intermediate term financial performance.
797468_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Average oil prices were higher in 2010 than 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was $91.38 and $79.36 per barrel as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	The average daily WTI market price for 2010 was $79.53 per barrel compared with $61.80 per barrel in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	Occidental s realized price for crude oil for its continuing operations as a percentage of average WTI prices was approximately 95 percent and 93 percent for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The average daily New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) domestic natural gas price in 2010 increased approximately 7 percent from 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	For 2010, the price averaged $4.49 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) compared with $4.20 per Mcf for 2009, and was $4.41 per Mcf as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	All sales, production and reserves volumes are net to Occidental and include amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, where applicable, unless otherwise specified.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Occidental conducts its operations in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Yemen and Qatar, including Dolphin, under PSCs or similar contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental receives a share of production and reserves to recover its costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	In addition, Occidental's share of production and reserves from operations in Long Beach, California and certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases wh en prices decline.
797468_11_ITEM7_P39_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Occidental's Permian production is diversified across a large number of producing areas in the Permian Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of the total United States crude oil production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Occidental is the largest producer of crude oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 16-percent net share of the total production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Starting in 2010, Permian Basin non-associated gas assets were included as part of the Midcontinent Gas operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	As a result of this change, the Permian business unit's production shifted from 84 percent liquids and 16 percent gas, to 89 percent liquids and 11 percent, mostly associated, gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	In the past several years, including 2010, Occidental increased its Permian interests through various acquisitions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Occidental s interests in Permian offer additional development and exploitation potential.
797468_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	During 2010, Occidental drilled approximately 190 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on third-party-operated properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Occidental conducted development activity on 11 CO 2 projects during 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Occidental had an average of 80 well service units working in Permian during 2010 performing well maintenance and workovers.
797468_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Approximately 66 percent of Occidental s Permian oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of CO 2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique.
797468_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	This technique involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	These CO 2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.
797468_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Occidental s policy regarding tertiary recovery is to capitalize costs when they support development of proved reserves and otherwise generally expense these costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	In 2009, Occidental capitalized approximately 50 percent of the costs of CO 2 injected in Permian.
797468_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Over the years, as the CO 2 program matured, a smaller portion of the injected CO 2 resulted in the development of proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Beginning in 2010, Occidental expensed 100 percent of the CO 2 injected, in order to better reflect the current nature of the CO 2 program.
797468_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Occidental's total share of Permian Basin oil and gas production was approximately 197,000 BOE per day in 2010, which included approximately 183,000 BOE per day from the Permian business unit.
797468_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	At the end of 2010, Occidental's Permian properties had approximately 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Occidental's California operations consist of holdings in the Elk Hills area, the Wilmington Field in the Los Angeles basin and other interests in the Ventura, San Joaquin, Los Angeles and Sacramento basins.
797468_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Occidental's interests in the Elk Hills area include the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of California s San Joaquin Valley, which it operates with an approximate 78-percent interest, along with other adjacent properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Elk Hills Field is the largest producer of gas and NGLs in California.
797468_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	During 2010, Occidental continued to perform infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques, resulting in approximately 240 new wells being drilled and approximately 190 wells being worked over.
797468_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	During 2010, Occidental continued to produce from the Kern County discovery area announced last year and continued to develop the multi-pay zones.
797468_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Based on currently available data, Occidental believes that its estimates of gross reserves ranges for the area remain reasonable for the combined conventional and unconventional pay zones.
797468_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Occidental began construction of a new gas processing plant in the Elk Hills area in 2010, and plans to commence building a second such plant in the next two years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Occidental also owns interests in California properties in the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento basins, other than Elk Hills.
797468_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The combined properties produce oil and gas from more than 50 fields.
797468_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Occidental holds approximately 1.6 million acres in California, the vast majority of which are net fee mineral interests.
797468_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	A large portion of such interests has been acquired in the last few years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	As a result, Occidental has a large inventory of properties available for future development.
797468_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Occidental's share of production and reserves from its operations in the Wilmington Field is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Occidental's total share of oil and gas production in California was approximately 139,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	At the end of 2010, Occidental's properties in California had approximately 768 million BOE in proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2010, Occidental combined most of its gas production in the mid-continent region of the United States into a single business unit called Midcontinent Gas, in order to take advantage of common development methods and production optimization opportunities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	This business unit includes the Hugoton Field, the Piceance Basin and the bulk of the Permian Basin non-associated gas assets, which were included as part of the Permian business unit in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	As a result, Midcontinent Gas production is approximately 70 percent gas and 30 percent liquids.
797468_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Midcontinent Gas properties are principally located in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Kansas and Oklahoma.
797468_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Occidental owns over 2.8 million net acres in the mid-continent region, which includes 1.4 million acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the Hugoton area located in Kansas and Oklahoma and approximately 1.4 million acres, mainly in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.
797468_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	In January 2011, Occidental completed the acquisition of gas producing properties in South Texas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Occidental also owns approximately 200,000 net acres of oil producing and prospective properties in North Dakota s Williston Basin, including acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	A substantial portion of this acreage was purchased in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Beginning in 2011, the new properties acquired during 2010 and 2011 located in South Texas and North Dakota will be grouped as part of Midcontinent and Other Interests.
797468_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	In 2010, Midcontinent and Other Interests produced approximately 62,000 BOE per day, which included non-associated gas from the Permian Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of December 31, 2010, proved reserves for these operations totaled approximately 266 million BOE.
797468_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The recent acquisitions provide Occidental with a large inventory of development projects.
797468_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Management conducted a review of Occidental s portfolio of oil and gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and concluded that certain projects had become uneconomical considering the natural gas price environment and that it would not pursue them.
797468_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $275 million, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	In December 2009, Occidental and its partners began operating the Bahrain Field.
797468_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Occidental has a 48-percent interest in the joint venture.
797468_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Occidental expects gross gas production capacity to grow more than 35 percent from a current level of 1.6 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.1 billion cubic feet per day within five years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	Gross oil production from the Bahrain Field is expected to more than double to approximately 75,000 barrels per day within five years and grow to a peak level of more than 100,000 barrels per day thereafter.
797468_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	Occidental's share of production from Bahrain during 2010 was approximately 169 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas and 3,000 barrels of oil per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	In January 2010, Occidental and its partners signed a technical service contract (TSC) with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field.
797468_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Occidental has a 23.44-percent interest in the TSC.
797468_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Under this TSC, Occidental is entitled to receive oil for cost recovery and remuneration fee, subject to achieving an initial gross production threshold.
797468_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	Occidental and its partners plan to increase production from the initial gross oil production level of approximately 180,000 BOE per day to a contractually targeted production level of 1.2 million BOE per day by 2016 or earlier and maintain this level of production for seven years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2010, Occidental and its partners achieved the initial gross production threshold.
797468_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of year-end 2010, Occidental's share of production was approximately 12,000 BOE per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Occidental, under agreements with the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC), participates in exploration and production operations in the Sirte Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	In June 2008, Occidental and its partner signed new agreements with NOC to upgrade its existing contracts for up to 30 years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Occidental's share of production from the Libya properties was approximately 13,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each, Block 53, with a 45-percent working interest, and Block 62, with a 48-percent working interest.
797468_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Occidental and its partners signed a 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) with the Government of Oman in 2005.
797468_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	In September 2005, Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna Field.
797468_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	By the end of 2010, Occidental had drilled over 1,020 new wells and continued implementation of a major pattern steam flood project.
797468_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	As of year-end 2010, the exit rate of gross daily production was over 15 times higher than the production rate in September 2005, reaching nearly 120,000 BOE per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	Occidental plans to steadily increase production through continued expansion of the steam flood project.
797468_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The term for Block 9 is through December 2015, with a potential 10-year extension.
797468_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The term for Block 27 is through September 2035.
797468_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Occidental has operations in Block 62 where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources.
797468_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Occidental's share of production from the Oman properties was approximately 69,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Occidental operates three offshore projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest.
797468_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2008, Occidental received approval from the Government of Qatar for the third phase of field development of the ISND Field focusing on continued development of mature reservoirs, while further delineating and developing less mature reservoirs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Drilling under this phase was completed during 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Occidental has proposed a fourth phase of development in ISND and field development plans for ISSD and Al Rayyan, which would include additional drilling through 2012.
797468_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Occidental's share of production from all of its operations in Qatar was approximately 139,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Occidental announced in January 2011 that it had reached an agreement-in-principle for a 40-percent interest in the Shah Field high sulfur content gas development project in Abu Dhabi, partnering with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.
797468_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	The project is anticipated to produce approximately 500 MMcf per day of natural gas, of which Occidental's net share will be approximately 200 MMcf per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	In addition, the project is expected to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day of liquids, of which Occidental's net share will be approximately 20,000 barrels per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	Production from this field is expected to begin no earlier than 2014.
797468_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	Capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $10 billion for the project with Oxy's share proportional to its ownership.
797468_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in the United Arab Emirates, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Occidental owns contractual interests in three producing blocks in Yemen, including a 38-percent working interest in the Masila Field, which expires in December 2011, a 40.4-percent interest, including an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, in the East Shabwa Field, and a 75-percent working interest in Block S-1, which Occidental operates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Occidental's share of production from the Yemen properties was approximately 30,000 BOE per day in 2010, which included nearly 14,000 BOE per day from the Masila Field.
797468_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	In December 2010, Occidental executed an agreement to sell its Argentine operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The sale closed in February 2011.
797468_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Argentine operations consist of 23 concessions located in the San Jorge Basin in southern Argentina and the Cuyo and Neuqu n Basins in western Argentina.
797468_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	Occidental operated 19 of the concessions with a 100-percent working interest.
797468_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	In 2010, Occidental obtained a ten-year extension for its hydrocarbon concessions in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina, which extended the concessions through a range of dates from 2025 to 2027.
797468_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	During 2010, Occidental drilled approximately 120 new development wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Occidental s share of production from the Argentine properties was approximately 43,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Occidental holds working interests in four blocks located in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia.
797468_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Occidental is the operator under four contracts within the Llanos Norte Basin: the Cravo Norte, Rond n, Cosecha, and Chipir n Association Contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Occidental s working interests under these four contracts are 39 percent, 44 percent, 53 percent and 61 percent, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	Occidental also holds a 48-percent working interest in the La Cira-Infantas Field, which is located in the Middle-Magdalena Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	Occidental's share of 2010 production from its Colombia operations was approximately 32,000 BOE per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2010 of 3,363 million BOE, as compared with the year-end 2009 amount of 3,230 million BOE.
797468_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Proved reserves at year-end 2010 consisted of 74 percent oil and liquids and 26 percent natural gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 75 percent of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2010 compared to 77 percent at year-end 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 409 million BOE in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	The total additions were as follows:
797468_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depend on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements, oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Many of these factors are outside of management s control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels.
797468_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	In 2010, revisions of previous estimates provided a net 1 million BOE reduction to reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Revisions included a net positive price-related increase for domestic oil and gas reserves, offset by a negative effect from PSCs mostly in the Middle East/North Africa as well as technical revisions, which were not material.
797468_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	For example, when oil prices increase, less oil volume is required to recover costs under PSCs, which results in a reduction of Occidental s share of proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	Conversely, when oil prices drop, Occidental s share of proved reserves increases for these PSCs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P89_S3	Oil and natural gas price changes also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves, primarily in domestic properties, in a manner offsetting the PSC reserve volume changes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P89_S4	Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical data regarding proved oil and gas reserves makes it more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative.
797468_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	In 2010, Occidental added proved reserves of 259 million BOE from improved recovery through its EOR activities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Generally, the improved recovery additions in 2010 were associated with the continued development of mature properties in California, Permian, Argentina and Oman.
797468_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	These properties are generally characterized by the deployment of secondary and tertiary development projects, largely employing application of waterflood (secondary), steamflood (tertiary) or CO 2 (secondary or tertiary) injection.
797468_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	These development projects are often applied through existing wells, though additional drilling may be required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	Steamflooding is the technique of injecting steam into the formation to lower oil viscosity so that it flows more freely into producing wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	This process is applied in areas where the oil is too viscous to be effectively moved with water.
797468_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	CO 2 flooding involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Occidental also obtained reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	In 2010, extensions and discoveries added 7 million BOE.
797468_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	In 2010, Occidental added 144 million BOE through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in the Permian and Williston Basins and the Zubair Field in Iraq.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	In 2010, Occidental had proved undeveloped reserves additions of 287 million BOE from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Of the total additions, 202 million BOE represented additions from improved recovery, primarily in California, Permian, Argentina, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Occidental added 81 million BOE through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in the Permian and Williston Basins and the Zubair Field in Iraq.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserves transfers of 135 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2010 development programs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S4	Occidental incurred approximately $1.4 billion in 2010 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S5	California, Permian, Argentina, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar accounted for approximately 86 percent of the reserves transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P96_S6	Proved undeveloped reserve additions will require incurrence of additional future development costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2010 were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	The current Senior Director of Worldwide Reserves and Reservoir Engineering is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.

797468_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) consisting of senior corporate officers, to monitor, review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In 2010, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of Occidental s methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2010, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory standards.
797468_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	In 2010, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific ap plication of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 74 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
797468_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	WTI generally increased throughout 2010, settling at $91.38 per barrel as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Oil prices will continue to be affected by global demand, which is generally a function of global economic conditions, as well as the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	These factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil prices reliably.
797468_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Occidental continues to adjust to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	While local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas, are decisive factors affecting domestic natural gas prices and local differentials over the long term, futures prices can be volatile, making it impossible to forecast prices reliably.
797468_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	The chemical segment earnings increased in 2010 as the world economies began recovering from the global economic downturn.
797468_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Expanding U.S. and international economies resulted in increased demand for chlorine, caustic soda, PVC and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).
797468_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	Margins in the U.S. were pressured by higher feedstock costs, but the feedstock costs in North America were favorable compared to Europe and Asia, resulting in strong demand for U.S.-produced products in export markets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	Occidental's vinyls exports in 2010 were 125 percent higher compared to 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	During 2010, demand and pricing for basic chemical products improved as U.S. and international manufacturing sectors recovered from the global economic downturn.
797468_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Despite the continued weakness within the U.S. housing sector, industry chlorine demand improved by 12 percent compared to 2009, as downstream chlorine derivatives remained competitive in the export markets as a result of feedstock cost advantages in natural gas and ethylene.
797468_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Improvements in the pulp, alumina and general manufacturing sectors aided caustic soda demand, which increased by 14 percent compared to 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	Chlorine prices were strong at the beginning of 2010 and remained fairly steady throughout the year.
797468_11_ITEM7_P110_S4	Caustic soda pricing increased throughout the year as the global supply and demand balance t ightened due to caustic soda demand rising at a faster rate than chlorine, various plant operating problems occurring in the U.S. and Europe, and the Chinese government s enforcement of controls on electricity consumption.
797468_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Year-over-year domestic demand fell 10 percent due to the continuation of low demand from the housing and commercial construction markets, offset by an 85-percent increase in industry export volumes compared with 2009 due to the continued cost advantage of U.S.-based feedstocks.
797468_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Overall, 2010 operating rates reflect an 11-percent increase over 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	Margins for PVC increased compared to 2009 as price increases outpaced increases in both ethylene and chlorine costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Future performance will depend on the recovery of domestic housing and construction markets, continued global economic recovery, and the cost competitiveness of U.S. feedstock and energy pricing compared to global markets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Higher domestic demand and margins for basic chemicals products in 2011 are expected to correlate with overall economic improvement in the U.S. as the housing, automotive and durable goods sectors further rebound from 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Margins are anticipated to continue to improve as pricing for chlorine and caustic soda is expected to remain strong and U.S. feedstock pricing to remain favorable compared to other global markets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Operating rates in 2011 are expected to increase from 2010 levels as export volumes remain strong throughout the year and domestic demand increases modestly.
797468_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	The U.S.-based feedstock cost advantage over other vinyls-producing regions is expected to continue.
797468_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the volumes of oil and gas it processes as well as the margins it obtains on throughput at its processing plants and transportation pipelines.
797468_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	The marketing and trading businesses earn margins from trading oil, gas and other commodities, marketing the oil and gas segment s products and storage activity.
797468_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	Generally, the midstream and marketing segment earns higher margins in high or increasing price environments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The midstream and marketing segment earnings increase in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading and gas processing businesses and increased earnings in the pipeline business.
797468_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The marketing and trading group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil and gas production, trades around the midstream and marketing segment assets and engages in commodities and commodity-related securities trading.
797468_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing crude oil and natural gas for resale from partners, producers and third parties whose oil and gas supply is located near midstream and marketing assets, such as pipelines, processing plants and storage facilities, that are owned or leased by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to maximize prices received for Occidental s production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, Occidental s Phibro trading unit uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futur es, swaps and options, some of which may be for physical delivery, in its strategy to profit from market price changes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Marketing and trading earnings are affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	In 2010, the marketing and trading group earnings improved due to higher trading income.
797468_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas by-products, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Margins result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	In 2008, Occidental signed an agreement for a third party to construct a gas processing plant that will provide CO 2 for Occidental s EOR projects in the Permian Basin.
797468_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	Occidental will own and operate the new facility, of which a portion became operational in 2010 with the remaining portions expected to be completed in 2012.
797468_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Occidental has secured transportation agreements to move CO 2 extracted at the facility to its Permian Basin production areas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Occidental s 2010 earnings from these operations improved due to higher gas processing margins.
797468_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE.
797468_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Through its 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy, the Dolphin Pipeline investment contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results.
797468_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Production of natural gas and NGLs under the DPSA from Qatar's North Field began during mid-2007 and, since mid-2008, production has been at full capacity of the Dolphin plant.
797468_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline has a capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman has grown and Dolphin Energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies.
797468_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar.
797468_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Occidental owns an oil-gathering, common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,700 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 365,000 barrels per day and 5.8 million barrels of active storage capability as well as 69 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	In 2010, Occidental purchased additional interests in Plains Pipeline.
797468_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	Occidental s 2010 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to volume and pricing increases from the Dolphin Pipeline investment and increased transportation revenue from domestic pipeline operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Earnings from power generation facilities are derived from the sales of steam and power to affiliates and third parties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	Occidental s 2010 earnings from these facilities increased due to higher margins between the selling prices of steam and the cost of gas used in their production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	On December 31, 2010, Occidental completed its acquisition of the remaining 50-percent joint-venture interest in EHP, a limited liability company that operates a gas-fired, power-generation plant in California, bringing Occidental's total ownership to 100 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The gas processing plant operations, which generate most of their income by separating and marketing liquids from wet gas, could have volatile results depending on NGL prices, which cannot be predicted.
797468_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	Generally, higher NGL prices result in higher profitability.
797468_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The trading and marketing business is inherently volatile.
797468_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Based on its framework of controls and risk management systems, Occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole.
797468_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Net income and income from continuing operations represent amounts attributable to common stock.
797468_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Segment earnings generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximately equal to those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings, income from continuing operations and net income represent amounts attributable to common stock after deducting noncontrolling interest amounts of $72 million, $51 million and $116 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	The 2010 amount includes a $275 million fourth quarter pre-tax charge for asset impairments, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The 2009 amount includes an $8 million pre-tax charge for the termination of rig contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The 2008 amount includes a $123 million pre-tax charge for asset impairments and a $46 million pre-tax charge for the termination of rig contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	The 2008 amount includes a pre-tax charge of $90 million for plant closure and impairments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	The 2010 amount includes an $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	The 2009 and 2008 amounts include tax benefits of $87 million and $148 million resulting from relinquishment of exploration properties, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The 2009 amount includes a $40 million pre-tax charge related to severance and a $15 million pre-tax charge for railcar leases.
797468_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The 2009 amount includes an after-tax charge of $111 million for asset impairments of certain Argentine producing properties and the 2008 amount includes an after-tax charge of $309 million for asset impairments of undeveloped acreage in Argentina.
797468_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	The following tables set forth the sales volumes and production of oil and liquids and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The differences between the sales volumes and production per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Includes sales volumes per day of 4 mbbl, 6 mbbl and 6 mbbl for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary.
797468_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	Includes production volumes per day of 5 mbbl, 6 mbbl and 6 mbbl for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the noncontrolling interest in a Colombia subsidiary.
797468_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Occidental has classified its Argentine operations as held for sale.
797468_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	Includes dry hole write-offs and lease impairments of $139 million in 2010, $200 million in 2009 and $230 million in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2010 were $7.2 billion compared to $5.1 billion in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The increase reflected higher average worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gas prices and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO 2 , higher field support and workover expenses and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	Daily oil and gas production volumes, including Argentina, were 753,000 BOE for 2010, compared with 718,000 BOE for the 2009 period.
797468_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	The 5 percent volume increase was mainly due to the new production in Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman, and gas production from domestic assets, which were partially offset by a decline in Colombia.
797468_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia resulting from higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting PSCs by 16,000 BOE per day.
797468_11_ITEM7_P148_S3	Daily sales volumes from continuing operations, were 705,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2010, compared with 678,000 BOE for 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2009 were $5.1 billion compared to $11.2 billion in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	The decrease in segment earnings reflected lower average crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased oil and gas production, lower operating costs and lower production and ad valorem taxes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Daily oil and gas production volumes, including Argentina, were 718,000 BOE for 2009, compared with 683,000 BOE for the 2008 period.
797468_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	The 5 percent volume increase reflected increases from California, Midcontinent Gas and the Mukhaizna field in Oman as well as higher volumes resulting from lower year-over-year average oil prices affecting PSCs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	Daily sales volumes from continuing operations, were 678,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2009, compared with 645,000 BOE for 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2010 included a pre-tax charge of $275 million for asset impairments, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.

797468_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2008 included a pre-tax charge of $123 million for asset impairments and a pre-tax charge of $46 million for termination of rig contracts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	Average production costs for 2010 on continuing operations, excluding taxes other than on income, were $10.19 per BOE, compared to $8.95 for 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P152_S1	The increase resulted from higher field support operations, workover and maintenance costs, as well as higher CO 2 costs, due to the change to expensing 100 percent of injected CO 2 beginning in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $438 million in 2010, compared to $389 million in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	The increase in 2010 reflected improved market conditions, particularly for exports, driven by favorable feedstock costs in North America compared to Europe and Asia.
797468_11_ITEM7_P153_S2	Vinyls exports in 2010 were 125 percent higher compared to 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $389 million in 2009 compared to $669 million in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	The decrease in 2009 results reflected lower volumes and prices for chlorine, caustic soda, PVC and VCM due to the economic slowdown, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	The 2008 earnings were also affected by a $90 million charge for plant closure and impairments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2010 were $472 million, compared to $235 million in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	The 2010 results reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading and gas processing businesses and increased earnings in the pipeline business.
797468_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2009 were $235 million, compared to $520 million in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	The 2009 results reflected lower marketing income and lower margins in gas processing.
797468_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
797468_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	The 2009 amount includes an after-tax charge of $111 million for asset impairments of certain Argentine producing properties and the 2008 amount includes an after-tax charge of $309 million for asset impairments of undeveloped acreage in Argentina.
797468_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.8 billion, were $3.1 billion at December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $330 million is included in prepaid expenses and other.
797468_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	Occidental s 2010 worldwide tax rate was 40 percent, which was comparable to 2009 and 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	The 2010 deferred income tax expense included an $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	The 2009 and 2008 income tax expense included tax benefits of $87 million and $148 million, respectively, resulting from relinquishments of exploration properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	Changes in the following components of Occidental's results of operations are discussed below:
797468_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	The increase in net sales in 2010, compared to 2009, was primarily due to higher oil, gas and chemical product prices and volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	Price and volume increases in the oil and gas segment represented approximately 71 percent of the overall increase, chemical volume and price increases represented 19 percent and midstream and marketing represented the remaining increase.
797468_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	The decrease in net sales in 2009, compared to 2008, was due to lower oil and gas and chemical product prices, partially offset by higher volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	Of the price-related decrease in sales, approximately 90 percent was associated with oil and gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	The decrease in interest, dividends and other income in 2009, compared to 2008, reflected lower interest income due to lower cash balances and interest rates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher oil and gas production costs, partly resulting from the effects of fully expensing CO 2 costs in 2010, as well as higher field operating, workover and maintenance costs and volumes; and higher chemical volumes, energy and feedstock costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	Cost of sales decreased in 2009, compared to 2008, mainly due to lower chemicals volumes and lower feedstock and energy costs, which collectively represented approximately 73 percent of the decrease.
797468_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	The remaining portion of the decrease was due to lower oil and gas and midstream and marketing operating costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher compensation costs, in particular, equity compensation expense due to higher stock prices in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2009, compared to 2008, due to lower foreign exchange gains, increased severance expense and idling fees for rigs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	DD A increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher DD A rates and volumes, including a full year of operations in Bahrain.
797468_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	DD A increased in 2009, compared to 2008, due to higher DD A rates and higher volumes from Oman and the U.S.
797468_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	The 2008 amount also included a charge of $42 million for domestic asset impairments.

797468_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	The increase in trade receivables, net was due to higher oil prices and higher oil and gas volumes in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P186_S1	The decrease in marketing and trading assets and other was mainly due to a decrease in trading securities and marketing activity.

797468_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	Investments in unconsolidated entities increased mainly due to the purchase of additional interests in Plains Pipeline, partially offset by Occidental s acquisition of the remaining 50-percent joint-venture interest in EHP, bringing Occidental's total ownership in EHP to 100 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P187_S1	EHP was consolidated in Occidental's balance sheet as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	The increase in PP E, net was due to capital expenditures and the acquisitions of oil and gas properties, partially offset by DD A and asset impairments.

797468_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	At December 31, 2010, Occidental had approximately $2.6 billion in cash on hand.
797468_11_ITEM7_P192_S1	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and sales volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P192_S2	Occidental believes that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and cash from pending divestitures will be sufficient to fund its planned acquisitions, as well as operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.

797468_11_ITEM7_P199_S0	As of December 31, 2010, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_11_ITEM7_P200_S0	The most important sources of the increase in operating cash flow in 2010, compared to 2009, were higher worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gas prices and volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P200_S1	In 2010, compared to 2009, Occidental s global realized crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices for continuing operations each increased by 31 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P200_S2	In 2010, Occidental's U.S. gas production represented approximately 59 percent of its worldwide natural gas production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P200_S3	Occidental s 2010 oil and gas sales volumes from continuing operations increased, compared to 2009, mainly due to the new production from Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman and higher domestic gas production, partially offset by a decline in Colombia.
797468_11_ITEM7_P200_S4	Increases in field support and energy costs in 201 0, compared to 2009, partially offset the increases in prices and volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P201_S0	Other cost elements, such as certain labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_11_ITEM7_P201_S1	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than oil and gas prices and volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P202_S0	The increase in operating cash flows in 2010, compared to 2009, also reflected higher chemical product prices for PVC, VCM, ethylene dichloride (EDC) and chlorine, which resulted in higher margins.
797468_11_ITEM7_P202_S1	In addition, all chemical product volumes increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to improved market conditions, particularly for exports.
797468_11_ITEM7_P202_S2	The 2010 operating cash flows also reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading and gas processing businesses and increased earnings in the pipeline business.
797468_11_ITEM7_P203_S0	The most important sources of the decrease in operating cash flow in 2009, compared to 2008, were lower average oil and natural gas prices, which were partially offset by increased oil and gas production volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P203_S1	In 2009, compared to 2008, Occidental s global realized crude oil prices for continuing operations decreased by 38 percent and realized natural gas prices for continuing operations decreased by 57 percent in the U.S., where approximately 67 percent of Occidental s natural gas was produced.
797468_11_ITEM7_P203_S2	Oil accounted for approximately 77 percent of Occidental's 2009 production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P203_S3	Occidental s oil and gas sales volumes increased by 6 percent in 2009, compared to 2008, due to increased production in California, Midcontinent Gas, Latin America and Oman.
797468_11_ITEM7_P203_S4	Decrease s in oil and gas production costs, purchased goods and services, energy costs and production and ad valorem taxes in 2009, compared to 2008, partially offset the effect of decreases in realized oil and natural gas prices in 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P204_S0	The lower operating cash flows in 2009, compared to 2008, also reflected lower chemical product volumes as well as lower product prices, especially for caustic soda, PVC and VCM, which resulted in lower margins.
797468_11_ITEM7_P204_S1	The 2009 operating cash flows also reflected lower marketing income and lower margins in the gas processing business of the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_11_ITEM7_P205_S0	In general, the overall impact of the chemical and midstream and marketing segments margins was less significant than the changes in oil and gas prices because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments' earnings and cash flows are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment.
797468_11_ITEM7_P206_S0	Other non-cash charges to income from continuing operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008 included stock incentive plan amortization, deferred compensation and asset retirement obligation accruals.
797468_11_ITEM7_P206_S1	The 2010 amount included a $275 million charge for asset impairments, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_11_ITEM7_P206_S2	The 2009 amount included an $8 million charge for the termination of rig contracts.

797468_11_ITEM7_P207_S0	Operating cash flows for discontinued operations included after-tax charges of $111 million for asset impairments of certain Argentine producing properties in 2009 and $309 million for asset impairments of unproved acreage in Argentina in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM7_P208_S0	Occidental s capital spending for 2011 is expected to be about $6.1 billion excluding the Shah Field development project, and will be focused on increasing oil and gas production and ensuring Occidental's returns remain well above its cost of capital given current oil and gas prices and the cost environment.
797468_11_ITEM7_P209_S0	The estimated increase in capital expenditures in 2011 from $3.9 billion in 2010 will be allocated to the oil and gas segment.
797468_11_ITEM7_P209_S1	Of the $6.1 billion of estimated 2011 capital spending, the Middle East/North Africa will receive approximately 27 percent, California will receive 20 percent, Permian will receive 14 percent and Midcontinent and Other Interests will receive 14 percent.

797468_11_ITEM7_P233_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_11_ITEM7_P233_S3	The ultimate amount of losses and the timing of any such losses that Occidental may incur resulting from currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be determined reliably at this time.

797468_11_ITEM7_P238_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_11_ITEM7_P238_S2	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.

797468_11_ITEM7_P239_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and could continue to rise in the future.
797468_11_ITEM7_P239_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_11_ITEM7_P240_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P240_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P240_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_11_ITEM7_P240_S3	The environmental proceedings s eek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P241_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 170 sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P242_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P243_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 13 of the 170 sites described above, and 122 of the sites had reserves from zero to $1 million each.
797468_11_ITEM7_P244_S0	As of December 31, 2010, two landfills in western New York owned by Occidental accounted for 71 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P244_S1	Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 15 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P245_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 17 of the 83 third-party sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P245_S1	Two of the remaining 66 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner and operator for certain remedial activities accounted for 50 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P246_S0	Five sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and two groups of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 74 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P246_S1	Four other sites former chemical plants in Delaware, Tennessee and Washington and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 67 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_11_ITEM7_P247_S0	The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_11_ITEM7_P248_S0	Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves over the next four years and the balance over the subsequent ten or more years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P248_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at the sites described above could be up to $385 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P248_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_11_ITEM7_P249_S0	Occidental s environmental costs for continuing operations, some of which include estimates, are shown below for each segment for the years ended December 31:
797468_11_ITEM7_P250_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_11_ITEM7_P251_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P251_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P252_S0	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $125 million for 2011.
797468_11_ITEM7_P253_S0	Many of Occidental s assets are located outside of North America.
797468_11_ITEM7_P253_S1	At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $12.1 billion, or approximately 23 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_11_ITEM7_P253_S2	Of such assets, approximately $7.5 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately $4.6 billion are located in Latin America, including $2.9 billion held for sale.
797468_11_ITEM7_P253_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010, net sales outside North America totaled $6.8 billion, or approximately 36 percent of total net sales.
797468_11_ITEM7_P254_S0	The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P254_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P254_S2	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_11_ITEM7_P254_S3	There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years.
797468_11_ITEM7_P254_S4	The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_11_ITEM7_P255_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire the PP E, including any capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_11_ITEM7_P255_S1	For business acquisitions, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_11_ITEM7_P256_S0	Interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P257_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P257_S1	Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized.
797468_11_ITEM7_P257_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_11_ITEM7_P257_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_11_ITEM7_P257_S4	Otherwise, the costs of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense.
797468_11_ITEM7_P258_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_11_ITEM7_P258_S1	Occidental's practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determinatio n of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_11_ITEM7_P259_S0	Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.
797468_11_ITEM7_P260_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_11_ITEM7_P260_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital exp enditures.
797468_11_ITEM7_P260_S2	Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S5	In such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S6	Estimation of future production and deve lopment costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S7	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S8	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_11_ITEM7_P261_S9	In 2010, revisions of previous estimates provided a net 1 million BOE reduction to proved reserves, which amounted to less than 1 percent of Occidental's total reserves as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P262_S0	The most significant financial statement impact of a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves would be on the DD A rate, which is determined using the unit-of-production method.
797468_11_ITEM7_P262_S1	Leasehold acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves, while capitalized development and successful exploration costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P262_S2	For example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.50 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by $128 million annually at current production rates.
797468_11_ITEM7_P262_S3	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S1	At December 31, 2010, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $3.7 billion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed in the period in which the determination was made.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_11_ITEM7_P263_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S0	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S1	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S2	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S3	Fluctuations in commodities prices and production and development costs could cause management's plans t o change with respect to unproved properties and could cause the carrying values of proved properties to be unrealizable.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S4	Such circumstances could result in impairments in the carrying values of proved or unproved properties or both.
797468_11_ITEM7_P264_S5	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM7_P265_S0	The recent acquisitions provide Occidental with a large inventory of projects.
797468_11_ITEM7_P266_S0	review of Occidental's portfolio of oil and gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and concluded that certain projects had become uneconomical considering the natural gas price environment and that it would not pursue them.
797468_11_ITEM7_P266_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $275 million, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P267_S0	Occidental's chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P267_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_11_ITEM7_P267_S2	The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_11_ITEM7_P267_S3	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could decrease significantly.
797468_11_ITEM7_P267_S4	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particular ly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P268_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P268_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM7_P269_S0	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately $300 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P269_S1	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_11_ITEM7_P269_S2	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $35 million per year.
797468_11_ITEM7_P270_S0	Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_11_ITEM7_P270_S1	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for such treatment and management elects to do so.
797468_11_ITEM7_P271_S0	If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated and documented as a cash-flow hedge, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_11_ITEM7_P271_S1	For cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_11_ITEM7_P271_S2	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffectiveness, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_11_ITEM7_P272_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions.
797468_11_ITEM7_P273_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_11_ITEM7_P273_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P274_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 to 125 percent.
797468_11_ITEM7_P275_S0	In the case of hedging a forecasted transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_11_ITEM7_P275_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; when the hedged item matures or is sold or re paid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_11_ITEM7_P276_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_11_ITEM7_P277_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_11_ITEM7_P277_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM7_P278_S0	Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques, in a three-level fair value hierarchy: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P278_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_11_ITEM7_P279_S0	Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P280_S0	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_11_ITEM7_P280_S1	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_11_ITEM7_P280_S2	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_11_ITEM7_P281_S0	Trading securities Quoted prices in active markets exist and are used to provide fair values for these instruments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P281_S1	These securities are classified as Level 1.
797468_11_ITEM7_P282_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_11_ITEM7_P282_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_11_ITEM7_P283_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial commodity contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_11_ITEM7_P283_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable dat a or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_11_ITEM7_P283_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_11_ITEM7_P284_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_11_ITEM7_P284_S1	This approach utilizes management's best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S0	Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achiev e the remedial objective.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_11_ITEM7_P285_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis only when the aggregate amount and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_11_ITEM7_P286_S0	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it has been established.
797468_11_ITEM7_P287_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_11_ITEM7_P287_S1	As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_11_ITEM7_P288_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional loss.
797468_11_ITEM7_P288_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) the regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; and (5) laws and regulations may impose more or less stringent remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability.
797468_11_ITEM7_P289_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_11_ITEM7_P289_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the con sequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_11_ITEM7_P289_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_11_ITEM7_P290_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of ten years at NPL sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_11_ITEM7_P290_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_11_ITEM7_P291_S0	If Occidental adjusts the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_11_ITEM7_P291_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $37 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P291_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $37 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P292_S0	Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P292_S1	Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
797468_11_ITEM7_P292_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_11_ITEM7_P292_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_11_ITEM7_P293_S0	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P293_S1	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions and the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors.
797468_11_ITEM7_P293_S2	See "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" for additional information.
797468_11_ITEM7_P294_S0	Listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P295_S0	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, Occidental enhanced its fair value measurement disclosures as a result of adopting new disclosure requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in January 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P295_S1	The new rules require interim and year-end disclosures of: (i) fair value measurements by classes of assets and liabilities; (ii) valuation techniques and inputs used for Level 2 or 3 fair value measurements; and (iii) significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements and the reasons for the transfers.
797468_11_ITEM7_P296_S0	Beginning January 1, 2010, Occidental modified its method of assessing the consolidation of variable interest entities as a result of adopting new accounting requirements issued by the FASB in June 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P296_S1	This new rule had no impact on Occidental s financial statements upon adoption.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S0	Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S1	Based on current market prices and levels of production, if oil prices vary by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $164 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S2	If domestic natural gas prices vary by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $144 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S3	As production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to oil and gas prices also will change.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S4	The trading and marketing results are also sensitive to price changes of oil, gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P297_S5	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on the trading and marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_11_ITEM7_P298_S0	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_11_ITEM7_P298_S1	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM7_P298_S2	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P298_S3	A variation in ethylene dichloride (EDC) prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $5 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P299_S0	Historically, product price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock product price changes; therefore, the margin effect of price changes is generally mitigated over time.
797468_11_ITEM7_P299_S1	According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2010 average contract prices were: chlorine $335 per ton, caustic soda $470 per ton, PVC $0.69 per lb and EDC $410 per ton.
797468_11_ITEM7_P300_S0	Through its marketing and trading activities and within its established policy controls and procedures, Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to improve realized prices for its oil and gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P300_S1	Additionally, Occidental, through its Phibro trading unit, engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P300_S2	Occidental has also used derivatives to reduce its exposure to price volatility on a small portion of its oil and gas production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S0	Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by certain members of management embedded in the marketing and trading operations who provide an independent and separate evaluation and check on marketing and trading activities in order to manage risk.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S2	These members of management report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S3	The President and Chief Operating Officer and risk committees comprising members of Occidental's senior corporate management also oversee these controls.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S4	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_11_ITEM7_P301_S5	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_11_ITEM7_P302_S0	The following tables show the changes in the net fair value of Occidental s marketing and trading derivative contracts during 2010 and 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P303_S0	Primarily relates to price changes on existing cash-flow hedges.
797468_11_ITEM7_P304_S0	The following table shows the fair value of derivatives, segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_11_ITEM7_P305_S0	As part of its third-party marketing and trading activities, Occidental enters into purchase and sale contracts for oil and gas.
797468_11_ITEM7_P305_S1	Occidental manages these contracts so that the aggregate terms and volumes of the purchases and sales generally approximate each other.
797468_11_ITEM7_P306_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental held a series of collar agreements that qualify as cash-flow hedges for the sale of approximately 2 percent of its crude oil production.
797468_11_ITEM7_P306_S1	These agreements are for existing domestic production and continue to the end of 2011.
797468_11_ITEM7_P306_S2	The following table presents the daily quantities and weighted-average strike prices of Occidental s collar positions as of December 31, 2010:
797468_11_ITEM7_P307_S0	In 2009, Occidental entered into financial swap agreements for the sale of a portion of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_11_ITEM7_P308_S0	The following table presents the daily quantities and weighted-average prices that will be received by Occidental as of December 31, 2010:
797468_11_ITEM7_P309_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental's North American leased storage facilities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P310_S0	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P310_S1	These derivative agreements continue through March 2011.
797468_11_ITEM7_P311_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental had approximately 28 Bcf of natural gas held in storage.
797468_11_ITEM7_P311_S1	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 24 Bcf of this natural gas held in storage.
797468_11_ITEM7_P312_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the total fair value of cash-flow hedges, which was a liability of $149 million, was included in the total fair value (a liability of $142 million) in the tables in "Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts" above.
797468_11_ITEM7_P313_S0	Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_11_ITEM7_P313_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95-percent level of confidence.
797468_11_ITEM7_P313_S2	The marketing and trading value at risk determined with this method was immaterial during 2010.
797468_11_ITEM7_P314_S0	The year ended December 31, 2010 included operations of the Phibro trading unit, which Occidental acquired on December 31, 2009.
797468_11_ITEM7_P314_S1	Occidental determined that operations of the unit are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
797468_11_ITEM7_P314_S2	This conclusion is based primarily on the trading limits Occidental placed on the unit, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, value at risk and credit, as well as the highly liquid positions the operations maintains, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_11_ITEM7_P315_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not expected to be material.
797468_11_ITEM7_P315_S1	As of December 31, 2010, variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_11_ITEM7_P316_S0	The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_11_ITEM7_P316_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_11_ITEM7_P317_S0	Excludes unamortized net discounts of $11 million.
797468_11_ITEM7_P318_S0	Occidental s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P318_S1	Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis and master netting agreements are used when appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P318_S2	Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits.
797468_11_ITEM7_P318_S3	Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure.
797468_11_ITEM7_P319_S0	A majority of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
797468_11_ITEM7_P320_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_11_ITEM7_P320_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM7_P320_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_11_ITEM7_P321_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties.
797468_11_ITEM7_P321_S1	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2010 was not material.
797468_11_ITEM7_P321_S2	Losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented.
797468_11_ITEM7_P322_S0	Occidental s foreign operations have currency risk.
797468_11_ITEM7_P322_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_11_ITEM7_P323_S0	Most international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
797468_11_ITEM7_P323_S1	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency.
797468_11_ITEM7_P323_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_11_ITEM7_P324_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_11_ITEM7_P325_S0	Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 and the information appearing under the captions "Business and Properties Competition and Sales and Marketing" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub captions "Strategy," "Oil and Gas Segment Proved Reserves" and " Industry Outlook," "Chemical Segment Industry Outlook," "Midstream, Marketing and Other Segment Industry Outlook," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Lawsuits, Claims, Contingencies and Related Matters," "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," and "Derivative Activities and Market Risk" contain forward-looking statements a nd involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.

797468_11_ITEM7_P326_S0	Material risks that may affect Occidental s results of operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," and elsewhere.
797468_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transaction s are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2010 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule.
797468_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_11_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
797468_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
797468_11_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_11_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_11_ITEM8_P10_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_11_ITEM8_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance w ith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

797468_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	On December 31, 2010, Occidental restructured its Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	In this report, "Occidental" or "the Company" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (OPC), and/or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries).
797468_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Occidental is a multinational organization whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the oil and gas, chemical and midstream, marketing and other segments.
797468_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops, produces and markets crude oil, including natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate (together with NGLs, "liquids"), as well as natural gas.
797468_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls and other chemicals.
797468_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, treats, processes, transports, stores, pu rchases and markets crude oil, liquids, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	It also trades around its assets, including pipelines and storage capacity, and trades oil and gas, other commodities and commodity-related securities.
797468_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Unless otherwise indicated hereafter, discussion of oil or oil and liquids refers to crude oil, NGLs and condensate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	In addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.
797468_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Occidental's proportionate share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, is accounted for by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Investments in unconsolidated entities represent equity-method investments, including advances.
797468_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Amounts representing Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates (excluding undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures) in which it does not have a majority voting interest, but as to which it exercises significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms, and for physical deliveries upon title transfer.
797468_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value in net sales.
797468_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances.
797468_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Management believes that these estimates and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial position and results of operations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets originate and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $12.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, and net sales of approximately $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions that prevent continued operations, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Since Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations for any particular year.
797468_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Cash equivalents totaled approximately $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or market and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Oil and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	For the chemical segment, Occidental's inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire the PP E, including any capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	For business acquisitions, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized.
797468_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_11_ITEM8_P45_S4	Otherwise, the costs of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense.
797468_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	f proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.
797468_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expend itures.
797468_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit-of-production method.
797468_11_ITEM8_P48_S3	Leasehold acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves, while capitalized development and successful exploration costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	At December 31, 2010, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $3.7 billion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties wou ld be expensed in the period in which the determination was made.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_11_ITEM8_P49_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	Fluctuations in commodities prices and production and development costs could cause management's plans to change with r espect to unproved properties and could cause the carrying values of proved properties to be unrealizable.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S4	Such circumstances could result in impairments in the carrying values of proved or unproved properties or both.
797468_11_ITEM8_P50_S5	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_11_ITEM8_P51_S3	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could decrease significantly.
797468_11_ITEM8_P51_S4	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particu larly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques, in a three-level fair value hierarchy: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Trading securities Quoted prices in active markets exist and are used to provide fair values for these instruments.
797468_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	These securities are classified as Level 1.
797468_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial commodity contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observ able data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	This approach utilizes management's best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $470 million and $635 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve t he remedial objective.
797468_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis only when the aggregate amount and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it has been established.
797468_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional loss.
797468_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) the regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; and (5) laws and regulations may impose more or less stringent remediation requirements or affect cost sha ring or allocation of liability.
797468_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the conseq uences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of ten years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	In the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life, and the cost of the obligation becomes reasonably estimable, Occidental recognizes the fair value of such asset retirement obligation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the adjusted risk-free rate of interest.
797468_11_ITEM8_P70_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_11_ITEM8_P70_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset re tirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the initial capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_11_ITEM8_P70_S4	No market risk premium has been included in Occidental s liability since no reliable estimate can be made at this time.
797468_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	Occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated.
797468_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_11_ITEM8_P71_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $762 million and $619 million is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for such treatment and management elects to do so.
797468_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated and documented as a cash-flow hedge, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	For cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffectiveness, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	There were no fair value hedges as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
797468_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 to 125 percent.
797468_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	In the case of hedging a forecasted transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	Occidental has established several shareholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy under each type of award issued under the Plans follows below.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	For stock options (Options), stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), performance stock awards (PSAs) and total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using potential exercise values or estimated payout levels using a Monte Carlo or other valuation models.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Compensation expense for all awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	Compensation expense for PSAs and TSRIs is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the number of shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria using valuation models.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S4	In addition, every quarter, compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of RSUs, SARs, PSAs and TSRIs is adjusted for changes in the value of the underlying stock.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S5	The stock-settled portion of all these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P81_S6	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in share-based payment transactions are considered participating securities prior to vesting, and, therefore, have been included in the earnings allocations in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	The computation of diluted EPS further reflected the dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in its financial statements and uses a measurement date of December 31.
797468_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	Occidental s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are determined based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	Occidental uses the fair value of assets to determine expected return on plan assets in calculating pension expense.
797468_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	Pension and postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S2	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S3	Common and collective trusts are valued at the net asset value (NAV) of the units provided by the fund issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S4	Collateral received for securities loaned includes investments in short-term investment funds.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S5	The short-term investment funds are valued at the NAV of the units provided by the fund issuer.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S6	Partnerships and joint ventures are valued using the liquidation value, which approximates fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P87_S7	The guaranteed deposit account is valued using a composite market value factor, which approximates fair value.
797468_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Occidental paid U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $2.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $4.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes for continuing operations, mostly in the U.S., of approximately $510 million, $484 million and $562 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	Additionally, net payments for income taxes related to discontinued operations were $42 million, $4 million and $11 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P88_S3	Production, property and other taxes paid related to discontinued operations were $197 million, $100 million and $28 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respe ctively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P88_S4	Interest paid totaled approximately $161 million, $164 million and $84 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the U.S. dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in U.S. dollars.
797468_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-U.S. dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.

797468_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	Five sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and two groups of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 74 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_11_ITEM8_P161_S1	Four other sites former chemical plants in Delaware, Tennessee and Washington and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 67 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves over the next four years and the balance over the subsequent ten or more years.
797468_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at the sites described above could be up to $385 million.
797468_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	Occidental s environmental costs for continuing operations, some of which include estimates, are shown below for each segment for the years ended December 31:
797468_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_11_ITEM8_P166_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are named, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs wit h other financially sound companies.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S3	The ultimate amount of losses and the timing of any such losses that Occidental may incur resulting from currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be determined reliably at this time.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S4	Occidental accrues reserves for all of these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S5	The amount of reserve balances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_11_ITEM8_P167_S6	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible additional losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible additional losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	While the audits of corporate tax returns for taxable years through 2008 have concluded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the 2009 and 2010 taxable years are currently under review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program.
797468_11_ITEM8_P169_S2	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P169_S3	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_11_ITEM8_P171_S2	At December 31, 2010, commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2011 and thereafter were approximately $1.2 billion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_11_ITEM8_P172_S2	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes and net of noncontrolling interest amounts were as follows:
797468_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	The following is a reconciliation, stated as a percentage of pre-tax income, of the United States statutory federal income tax rate to Occidental s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations:
797468_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:
797468_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	Included in total deferred tax assets was a current portion aggregating $330 million and $280 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that was reported in prepaid expenses and other.
797468_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_11_ITEM8_P177_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	Occidental has, as of December 31, 2010, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $718 million, which expire in varying amounts through 2020, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	Substantially all of Occidental's valuation allowance is provided for foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	In 2010, Occidental recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $80 million related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $6.0 billion at December 31, 2010, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $88 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	The discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $26 million in 2010, $147 million in 2009 and $218 million in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	Additional paid-in capital was credited $22 million in 2010, $24 million in 2009 and $77 million in 2008 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $38 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
797468_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	It is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next twelve months by a material amount.
797468_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	The following is an analysis of common stock issuances:
797468_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	Occidental has had a 95 million share authorization in place since 2008 for its share repurchase program; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	In 2008, Occidental purchased 19.8 million shares under the program at an average cost of $76.33 per share.
797468_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
797468_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, treasury stock shares numbered 72.5 million, 71.7 million and 71.2 million, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.
797468_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.
797468_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax gains (losses):
797468_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	See Note 13 for further information.
797468_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	Occidental has established several Plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards in the form of RSUs, Options, SARs, PSAs and TSRIs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and as of December 31, 2010, approximately 53 million shares were available for future issuance.
797468_11_ITEM8_P195_S2	During 2010, non-employee directors were granted awards for 69,114 shares of restricted stock that fully vested on the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P195_S3	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	The table below summarizes certain stock-based incentive amounts for the past three years:
797468_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	Includes cash paid under the cash-settled SARs and the cash-settled portion of the PSAs and RSUs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the RSUs and PSAs.
797468_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there was $163 million of pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense, based on year-end valuation, related to all unvested stock-based incentive award grants.
797468_11_ITEM8_P199_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
797468_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	Certain employees are awarded the right to receive cash-settled RSUs, which are equivalent in value to actual shares of Occidental common stock but are paid in cash at the time of vesting.
797468_11_ITEM8_P200_S1	These awards vest either in total over two years or ratably over three years after the grant date and can be forfeited or accelerated under certain conditions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P200_S2	For those awards which vest in total over two years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting period and are paid when they vest.
797468_11_ITEM8_P200_S3	For those awards which vest ratably, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P200_S4	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of these awards granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $77.14, $66.43 and $76.23 per share, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	Certain employees are awarded the right to receive stock-settled RSUs that vest at the end of, or ratably over, three years from the grant date and can be forfeited or accelerated under certain conditions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	Dividends or dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	The weighted-average, grant-date fair value of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2010 was $84.29.
797468_11_ITEM8_P201_S3	There were no such awards granted in 2009 and the 2008 grants were immaterial.
797468_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented below:
797468_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	Certain employees have been granted Options that are settled in stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	No Options or SARs have been granted since 2006 and all outstanding awards are vested.
797468_11_ITEM8_P203_S2	Exercise prices of the Options and SARs were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P203_S3	Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years from the grant date with a maximum term of ten years.
797468_11_ITEM8_P203_S4	These Options and SARs may be forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.
797468_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	The fair value of each Option, stock-settled SAR or cash-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted-average life of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life.
797468_11_ITEM8_P205_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P205_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2010:
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	Certain executives are awarded PSAs and TSRIs that vest at the end of the three- or four-year period following the grant date if performance targets are certified as being met.
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S1	TSRIs granted in October 2010 had payouts that ranged from 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award that would settle, once certified, 50 percent in stock and 50 percent in cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S2	TSRIs granted in July 2009 had payouts that ranged from 0 to 200 percent of the target award that would settle, once certified, 60 percent in stock and 40 percent in cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S3	TSRIs granted in July 2008 and 2007 had payouts that ranged from 0 to 150 percent of the target award that would settle, once certified, equally in stock and cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S4	PSAs granted prior to July 2007 had payouts that ranged from 0 to 200 percent of the target award and provided that, once certified, the first 100 percent payout would settle only in stock and any payout in excess of 100 percent would settle in cash.
797468_11_ITEM8_P207_S5	Dividend equivalents for PSA and TSRI target shares are paid during the performance period regardless of the payout range or settlement provision, except for the TSRIs issued in 2010, for which cumulative dividends will be paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	The fair values of PSAs and TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer companies.
797468_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_11_ITEM8_P210_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of PSAs and TSRIs were as follows:
797468_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	A summary of Occidental s unvested PSAs and TSRIs as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented below:
797468_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	Unvested awards and award grants are presented at the target or mid-point payouts.
797468_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	The weighted-average payout at vesting was 200 percent of the target.
797468_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, age level and employee contributions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that provides restoration of benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $109 million and $95 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and Occidental expensed $101 million in 2010, $97 million in 2009 and $93 million in 2008 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement pl ans.
797468_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 1,100 domestic and 1,600 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	The benefits are generally funded by Occidental as the benefits are paid during the year.
797468_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	The total benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $180 million in 2010, $158 million in 2009 and $142 million in 2008.
797468_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following table shows the funding status of Occidental's plans:
797468_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were $259 million, $234 million and $82 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, and $175 million, $158 million and $35 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with plan assets in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation were $365 million, $360 million and $413 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, and $398 million, $390 million and $447 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	Occidental has 401(h) accounts established within certain defined benefit pension plans.
797468_11_ITEM8_P222_S1	These plans allow Occidental to fund postretirement medical benefits for employees at two of its operations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P222_S2	Contributions to these 401(h) accounts are made at Occidental's discretion.
797468_11_ITEM8_P222_S3	All of Occidental's other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded.
797468_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:
797468_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, AOCI included the following after-tax balances:
797468_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2011.
797468_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $14 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $31 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Hewitt Bond Universe yield curve in 2010 and 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P228_S1	The weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental s past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation.
797468_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	Occidental considers historical returns and correlation of equities and fixed income securities and current market factors such as inflation and interest rates.
797468_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 12.0 percent at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P230_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from a low of 1.5 percent to a high of 12.0 percent in 2010, depending on local economic conditions.
797468_11_ITEM8_P230_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 6.8 percent and 6.9 percent in excess of local inflation in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates projected at an assumed Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 2.54 percent and 2.55 percent as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_11_ITEM8_P231_S1	Beginning in 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.

797468_11_ITEM8_P288_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_11_ITEM8_P289_S0	In 2010, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of Occidental s methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2010, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory standards.
797468_11_ITEM8_P289_S1	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_11_ITEM8_P290_S0	In 2010, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P290_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 74 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P290_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_11_ITEM8_P291_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM8_P291_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
797468_11_ITEM8_P292_S0	Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_11_ITEM8_P293_S0	Effective beginning the year ended December 31, 2009, the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board modified certain disclosure requirements for oil and gas properties.
797468_11_ITEM8_P293_S1	Occidental adopted these requirements as of December 31, 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P293_S2	As a result, proved oil and gas reserves are now calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year instead of the year-end market price.
797468_11_ITEM8_P293_S3	For the 2010, 2009 and 2008 disclosures, the West Texas Intermediate oil prices used were $79.43 per barrel, $61.18 per barrel and $44.60 per barrel, respectively.

797468_11_ITEM8_P294_S1	The adoption of the new requirements did not have a material effect on Occidental's proved reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S0	Historically, Occidental s production volumes and reserves had been reported as a mix of pre-tax and after-tax volumes while its revenues reflected pre-tax sales.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S1	This difference is caused by Occidental s PSCs in the Middle East/North Africa where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S2	Occidental has historically reported these volumes as additional revenues and income taxes but not additional production and reserves.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S3	To simplify Occidental s reporting and to conform with industry practice, Occidental included these volumes in its reserves as of December 31, 2009.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S4	Beginning in 2010, Occidental s production volumes match revenues reported.
797468_11_ITEM8_P295_S5	For ease of comparison, prior year data for daily production vol umes and for results per unit of production computations are shown using pre-tax amounts.
797468_11_ITEM8_P296_S0	Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated DD A were as follows:

797468_11_ITEM8_P310_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_11_ITEM8_P310_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past.
797468_11_ITEM8_P311_S0	Revenues from net production exclude royalty payments and other adjustments.
797468_11_ITEM8_P312_S0	United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.

797468_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 10, 2011 and present ed herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes , preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2010 .
797468_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of California and Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in certain production sharing and similar contracts for certain properties located in the United States in the state of California and in the Middle East in the countries of Qatar and Yemen.
797468_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold or saleable basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on an equivalent barrel (BOE) basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.
797468_11_ITEM15_P105_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past.
797468_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that c losely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, and (4) the classificati on of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_11_ITEM15_P111_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_11_ITEM15_P111_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_11_ITEM15_P111_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, eit her proved or unproved.
797468_11_ITEM15_P111_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_11_ITEM15_P113_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2010 ; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2010 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_11_ITEM15_P117_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination somethin g came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_11_ITEM15_P119_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy and modeling .
797468_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	Approximately 75 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	e the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced oil recovery response to CO 2 injection.
797468_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	All of the proved undeveloped reserves and approximately 85 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves for the properties reviewed were estimated by one of the two performance methods noted above and supported by analogs.
797468_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	The remaining 15 percent of the proved non-producing reserves were estimated by modeling of the surface network of oil and gas-lift lines to estimate the incremental reserves associated with debottlenecking certain fields.
797468_11_ITEM15_P122_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available.
797468_11_ITEM15_P123_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows , Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves revie wed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2010 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average and differentials as previously described.
797468_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_11_ITEM15_P129_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	T he operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_11_ITEM15_P132_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_11_ITEM15_P132_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_11_ITEM15_P135_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_11_ITEM15_P135_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P135_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_11_ITEM15_P136_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_11_ITEM15_P137_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P137_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_11_ITEM15_P137_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the United States in the state of California and in the countries of Qatar and Yemen and reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S1	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S2	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S3	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in Qatar and Yemen include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S4	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_11_ITEM15_P140_S5	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volum es of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently is expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves, forecasts of future productio n and income , we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, p roduction and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recom pletion and development costs, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_11_ITEM15_P145_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2010.
797468_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

797468_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects Occidental s results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Occidental s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and gas.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Changes in consumption patterns, global and local economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, technological developments, weather, geophysical and technical limitations and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas, which, along with the effect of changes in market perceptions, contribute to price unpredictability and volatility.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Demand and, consequently, the price obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Occidental s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire, develop or find additional reserves.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which are: (i) larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	During periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Occidental bears the risks of development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for drilling and other permits, equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Exploration is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	refusal or delay in the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Occidental may experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Occidental faces risks associated with its acquisitions and divestitures.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Occidental s acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as product prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Calculations of oil and gas reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates and operating performance, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If Occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Concerns about climate change may affect Occidental s operations.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There is an ongoing effort to assess and quantify the effects of climate change and the potential human influences on climate.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The U.S. federal government and the states of California and New Mexico have adopted, and other jurisdictions are considering, legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	California s cap-and-trade program is moving into the implementation phase.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate certain GHG emissions from both stationary and mobile sources.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international, national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	However, Occidental could face risks of delays in development projects, increases in costs and taxes and reductions in the demand for and restrictions on the use of its products as a result of ongoing GHG reduction efforts.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The occurrence of events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, industrial accidents, physical or cyber attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed, may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Occidental has no unresolved SEC staff comments that have been outstanding more than 180 days at December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	The current term of employment of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 4, 2012, organizational meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by 33,819 stockholders of record at December 31, 2011, and by approximately 475,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The quarterly financial data, which are included in this report after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The quarterly dividends declared on the common stock were $0.46 for all quarters of 2011 ($1.84 for the year).
797468_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	On February 9, 2012, a quarterly dividend of $0.54 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2012 to stockholders of record on March 9, 2012.
797468_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	All of Occidental's equity compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans was approximately 66 million as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	The following is a summary of the securities reserved for issuance under such plans:
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	Of these shares, depending on the type of award granted, approximately 8.8 million to 26.3 million shares were available at December 31, 2011 for grants of future awards.
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The number available is less than 52 million shares because a plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to be counted as three shares against the number of shares available for future awards.
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	Applying this provision to the remaining 52 million shares, approximately 26 million shares have been reserved for currently outstanding but unvested awards and for previously vested and issued shares.
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	The available share number varies because options and stock appreciation rights reduce the shares remaining for future awards only by the number of shares issuable under the award (rather than three times that number).
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S4	Failure of currently outstanding awards to vest would increase the shares available for future awards by three times the number of shares covered by such awards.
797468_12_ITEM5_P4_S5	For example, if all awards that are currently outstanding failed to vest, approximately 39 million shares would be available for grants of future awards.
797468_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, were as follows:
797468_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	Includes shares purchased from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Occidental has had a 95 million share repurchase program authorized since 2008; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s peer groups over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM5_P8_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) in the stock of the companies in the S P 500 and (iii) in each of the current and prior peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the respective peer groups and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	In 2011, Occidental revised its current peer group due to a significant decrease in market capitalization and restructuring of a previously included entity.
797468_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	Prior to the revision, Occidental's peer group consisted of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM5_P9_S2	Occidental's current peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Total S.A. and Occidental.

797468_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments operated by OPC's subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The midstream, marketing and other segment gathers, treats, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO 2 and power.
797468_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including pipelines and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet.
797468_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Occidental prefers to seek growth of oil and gas production by holding large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Capital is employed to operate segment assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital.
797468_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Management currently believes its growth will be most strongly affected by the success of the development plans for its California prospects, the Permian development program, Oman and the Shah Gas Field development project in Abu Dhabi.
797468_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The primary objective of the chemical business is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Capital is employed to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound manner, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The midstream and marketing segment is also managed to generate returns on capital employed in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	In marketing its own production and third-party purchases, Occidental attempts to maximize realized prices and margins and limit credit risk exposure.
797468_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	In commodities trading, Occidental seeks to generate gains using net-long positions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Capital is employed to operate segment assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner, to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Occidental maintains financial discipline by prioritizing the uses of its cash flows in the following order:
797468_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The oil and gas business seeks to increase its oil and gas production profitably and add new reserves at a pace ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development of such reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by:
797468_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures with an emphasis on transactions at attractive prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within its core areas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the first quarter of 2011, Occidental sold its Argentine oil and gas operations for after-tax proceeds of approximately $2.6 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	In 2011, Occidental also completed the acquisition of producing properties in South Texas for approximately $1.8 billion and acquired other domestic oil and gas assets, which included properties in California, as well as the Permian and Williston Basins for approximately $2.6 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Internationally, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the Shah Gas Field development project in Abu Dhabi, which is operated by Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company Limited (Al Hosn Gas Project), in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Occidental partnered with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in a 30-year joint venture agreement for the $10 billion project, of which Occidental s portion is approximately $4 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	In May 2011, Occidental paid approximately $500 million for its share of pre-acquisition development expenditures.
797468_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	Approximately $460 million of this amount related to expenditures recorded in the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	In addition, Occidental continues to deploy significant capital to its core operations in the Permian Basin and California, as well as in Iraq, Oman and Qatar, to increase production from these assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	OxyChem s strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, both of which are marketed to third parties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC.
797468_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The midstream and marketing segment is managed to generate returns on capital invested in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	In order to generate these returns, the segment provides low-cost services to other segments and operates and invests in gas plants and oil, gas, NGLs and CO 2 pipeline systems and storage facilities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	It also provides similar services to third parties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	In addition, the marketing and trading group markets Occidental's and third-party oil and gas, trades around the midstream and marketing segment assets and engages in commodities trading.
797468_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in its key performance metrics, which ultimately drives total stockholder return.
797468_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Occidental believes the following are the most significant metrics that maximize total stockholder return:
797468_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE).
797468_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In addition, Occidental monitors other segment-specific measures such as per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development cost and others.
797468_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Occidental's oil and gas production has grown a cumulative 15 percent for the three-year period from 2008 through 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Based on the $2.16 per share annual dividend rate announced in February 2012, Occidental s dividend rate has increased by 332 percent in 10 years.
797468_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	While Occidental's stockholders' equity increased by 16 percent for 2011 and 29 percent for the three-year period from 2009 through 2011, it continued to deliver above-cost-of-capital returns as follows:
797468_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The ROE and ROCE for 2011 were calculated by dividing Occidental's 2011 net income attributable to common stock (taking into account after-tax cost of capital for ROCE) by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, during 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The three-year average ROE and ROCE were calculated by dividing Occidental's average net income attributable to common stock (taking into account after-tax cost of capital for ROCE) over the three-year period 2009-2011 by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, over the same period.
797468_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	As a result, through December 31, 2011, Occidental s total stockholder return has been 110 percent over the past five years and 769 percent over the past 10 years.
797468_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Occidental s year-end 2011 total debt-to-capitalization (debt and equity) ratio was 13 percent.
797468_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	In the first quarter of 2011, Occidental redeemed $1.4 billion of senior notes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Occidental issued $2.15 billion of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Occidental has a $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2011 Credit Facility).
797468_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The interest rate on any borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility is based in part on Occidental s senior debt ratings.
797468_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Occidental s long-term senior unsecured debt was rated A by Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poor s Ratings and DBRS.
797468_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Occidental s long-term unsecured debt was rated A2 by Moody s Investors Service.
797468_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
797468_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short- and intermediate-term financial performance.
797468_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Average oil prices were higher in 2011 than 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The average daily per barrel WTI and Brent market prices, respectively, for 2011 were $95.12 and $110.90, compared with $79.53 and $79.61 in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Approximately 60 percent of Occidental s oil production tracks world oil prices, such as Brent, and 40 percent is indexed to WTI.
797468_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Occidental s average realized price for oil as a percentage of average WTI and Brent prices was approximately 103 percent and 88 percent for 2011, and 95 percent and 94 percent for 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Occidental's average realized price for NGLs as a percentage of average WTI price was approximately 56 percent and 57 percent for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The average daily New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) domestic natural gas price in 2011 decreased approximately 8 percent from 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	For 2011, the price averaged $4.11 per Mcf compared with $4.49 per Mcf for 2010, and was $2.99 per Mcf as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which are extended through the end of production once production commences.
797468_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Of the total 7.4 million net acres domestically where Occidental conducts its operations, 73 percent is leased, 26 percent represents owned subsurface mineral rights and for 1 percent it owns both land and the mineral rights.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Occidental has interests in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Yemen and Qatar, including Dolphin, that are operated under PSCs or similar contracts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental receives a share of production and reserves to recover its costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	In addition, Occidental's share of production and reserves from operations in Long Beach, California, and certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following chart shows Occidental s total volumes for the last five years:
797468_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Occidental's Permian production is diversified across a large number of producing areas in the Permian Basin.
797468_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Occidental is the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 15-percent net share of the total production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin.
797468_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In the past several years, including 2011, Occidental increased its Permian interests through various acquisitions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Occidental s interests in Permian offer additional development and exploitation potential.
797468_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	During 2011, Occidental drilled approximately 409 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on third-party-operated properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Approximately 64 percent of Occidental s Permian oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of CO 2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique.
797468_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	This technique involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	These CO 2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.
797468_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	During 2011, Occidental s non-CO 2 operations increased their development program, which accounted for more than half of the wells drilled in Permian.
797468_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Occidental's total share of production in Permian was approximately 198,000 BOE per day in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Occidental's California operations consist of holdings in the Elk Hills area, the Wilmington and other fields in the Los Angeles basin and interests in the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento basins.
797468_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Occidental's properties in California consist of more than 90 fields.
797468_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Occidental's interests in the Elk Hills area include the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of California s San Joaquin Valley, which it operates with an approximate 78-percent interest, along with other adjacent properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Elk Hills Field is the largest producer of gas and NGLs in California.
797468_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	During 2011, Occidental continued to invest in the Elk Hills area, performing infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques, resulting in approximately 330 new wells being drilled.
797468_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Occidental began construction of a new gas processing plant in the Elk Hills area in 2010, which is expected to be completed in 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Occidental holds approximately 1.7 million acres in California, the vast majority of which are net fee mineral interests.
797468_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	As a result, Occidental has a substantial inventory of properties available for future development and exploitation in conventional areas, as well as unconventional prospects, such as shale.
797468_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	In all of California during 2011, Occidental drilled approximately 675 wells and performed approximately 500 workovers.

797468_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Occidental's total share of production in California was approximately 138,000 BOE per day in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Midcontinent properties, which include interests in the Hugoton Field and the Piceance Basin, are located in Colorado, Utah, Kansas and Oklahoma.
797468_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Occidental holds over 2.4 million net acres in the midcontinent region, which includes 1.4 million acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the Hugoton area located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and approximately 1.0 million acres in Colorado and Utah.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other interests are located in North Dakota, Montana, South Texas and West Virginia.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	In January 2011, Occidental completed the acquisition of producing properties in South Texas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Occidental holds approximately 138,000 net acres in South Texas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	Occidental also holds approximately 277,000 net acres of oil producing and prospective unconventional properties in North Dakota s Williston Basin, including acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	A substantial portion of this acreage was purchased in 2011 and 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P53_S5	In addition, Occidental holds 229,000 net acres in West Virginia.
797468_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	In Midcontinent and Other, Occidental drilled approximately 270 wells and produced approximately 92,000 BOE per day in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Occidental expects to reduce drilling activity for gas wells in 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2009, Occidental and its partners began operating the Bahrain Field under a 20-year development and production sharing agreement (DPSA).
797468_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Occidental has a 48-percent working interest in the joint venture.
797468_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Since handover of operations, Occidental and its partners have increased gross gas production capacity more than 40 percent from an initial level of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.1 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production by 60 percent from 26,000 barrels per day to 42,000 barrels per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Occidental plans to continue growing gross gas production capacity to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day and gross oil production to over 75,000 barrels.
797468_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	Occidental's share of production from Bahrain during 2011 was approximately 173 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas and 4,000 barrels of oil per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	In 2010, Occidental and its partners signed a 20-year contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field.
797468_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Occidental has a 23.44-percent interest in this contract, which entitles Occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee, as a result of having achieved an initial gross production threshold of approximately 180,000 BOE per day in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Occidental and its partners plan to increase production to a contractually targeted production level of 1.2 million BOE per day by 2016 and maintain this level of production for seven years.
797468_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	Occidental's share of production in Iraq was approximately 7,000 BOE per day in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occidental, under agreements with the Libyan National Oil Corporation, participates in Sirte Basin producing operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	In early 2011, Occidental ceased exploration activities and its participation in production operations in Libya due to civil unrest in the country and United States sanctions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The United States government lifted its sanctions in September 2011 and Occidental resumed its participation in the producing operations at that time.
797468_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Occidental Libya s 2011 and 2010 production volumes were approximately 4,000 and 13,000 BOE per day, representing less than 1 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of Occidental s worldwide volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each block; Block 53, with a 45-percent working interest; and Block 62, with a 48-percent working interest.
797468_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Occidental and its partners signed a 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) with the Government of Oman in 2005, pursuant to which Occidental assumed operations of the field.

797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	The project is anticipated to produce over 500 MMcf per day of natural gas, of which Occidental s net share would be over 200 MMcf per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	In addition, the project is expected to produce over 50,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensates, of which Occidental s net share would be over 20,000 barrels per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	Occidental s 2011 capital expenditures for this project were approximately $460 million, with an additional $500 million paid for Occidental's share of pre-acquisition development expenditures.
797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S5	A substantial portion of the total expenditures to date have been incurred in connection with plants and facilities, which are included in the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S6	As the development project progresses, higher portions of the capital will be spent to drill wells, which will be reflected in the oil and gas segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P68_S7	Occidental believes that its share of remaining capital until production from the field begins (expected to be in 2014), will be approximately $3 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Occidental owns contractual interests in two producing blocks in Yemen, Block 10 East Shabwa Field with a 40.4-percent interest that includes an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, and Block S-1 An Nagyah Field, which is an Occidental-operated block with a 75-percent working interest.
797468_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Occidental s working interests in the Block 14 Masila Field expired in December 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Occidental's share of production from the Yemen properties was approximately 27,000 BOE per day in 2011, which included nearly 11,000 BOE per day from the Masila Field.
797468_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Occidental holds working interests in four blocks located in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia.
797468_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Occidental is the operator under four contracts within the Llanos Norte Basin: the Cravo Norte, Rond n, Cosecha and Chipir n association contracts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Occidental s working interests under these four contracts are 39 percent, 44 percent, 53 percent and 61 percent, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Occidental also holds a 48-percent working interest in the La Cira-Infantas Field, which is located in the Middle-Magdalena Basin.
797468_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Occidental's share of 2011 production from its Colombian operations was approximately 29,000 BOE per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2011 of 3,176 million BOE, as compared with the year-end 2010 amount of 3,167 million BOE.
797468_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Proved reserves at year-end 2011 and 2010 consisted of, respectively, 63 percent and 64 percent oil, 9 percent and 9 percent NGLs and 28 percent and 27 percent natural gas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 76 percent of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2011 and 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 276 million BOE in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	The total additions were as follows:
797468_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements, oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	Many of these factors are outside of management s control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels.
797468_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserves estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation of existing or new geologic, production decline or operating performance data, or changes in prices and costs that are used in reserves estimations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	In 2011, revisions of previous estimates provided a net 214 million BOE reduction to reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	For example, when oil prices increase, less oil volume is required to recover costs under PSCs, which results in a reduction of Occidental s share of proved reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Conversely, when oil prices drop, Occidental s share of proved reserves increases for these PSCs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Oil and natural gas price changes also affect the economic lives of proved reserves, primarily in domestic properties, in a manner offsetting these PSC effects, because higher prices result in longer reservoir lives and more reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	In 2011, Occidental s domestic reserves had a positive price-related revision as a result of higher oil prices, net of negative revisions in certain properties resulting from lower gas prices during the year.
797468_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	International reserves had negative price adjustments due to high oil prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	Price adjustments for the company as a whole were negative.
797468_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	If the currently prevailing natural gas prices stay at depressed levels for an extended period, domestic gas reserves could experience a further negative price revision at the end of 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Other revisions outside the United States were largely in Libya and Iraq.
797468_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	In Libya, the revision was the result of the current situation in the country where development plans for proved undeveloped reserves have not yet been put into effect.
797468_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	expected pace of the development resulted in a revision to the proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	In both countries, Occidental expects that these reserves will be reinstated as the development plans progress.
797468_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	Other revisions internationally were caused by the performance of previously drilled wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	In the United States, other revisions were caused by performance issues related to wells drilled in prior periods.
797468_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The revisions involved several properties where wells experienced higher than expected decline rates.
797468_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Sizable portions of these revisions were transferred from the proved category to probable, possible and contingent categories.
797468_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical data regarding proved oil and gas reserves makes it more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative.
797468_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2011, Occidental added proved reserves of 264 million BOE from improved recovery through its EOR and infill drilling activities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Generally, the improved recovery additions in 2011 were associated with the continued development of properties in California, Permian, Williston, Oman, Colombia and Bahrain.
797468_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	These properties are generally characterized by the deployment of secondary and tertiary development projects, largely employing application of waterflood (secondary), steamflood (tertiary) or CO 2 (secondary or tertiary) injection.
797468_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	These development projects are often applied through existing wells, though additional drilling may be required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	Steamflooding is the technique of injecting steam into the formation to lower oil viscosity so that it flows more freely into producing wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	This process is applied in areas where the oil is too viscous to be effectively moved with water.
797468_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	CO 2 flooding involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Occidental also obtained reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	In 2011, extensions and discoveries added 25 million BOE.
797468_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	In 2011, Occidental added 201 million BOE through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in South Texas, the Permian Basin and California.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	In 2011, Occidental had proved undeveloped reserves additions of 307 million BOE from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	Of the total additions, 186 million BOE represented additions from improved recovery, primarily in California, Permian, Williston, Oman, Colombia, Bahrain and Qatar.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	Occidental added 106 million BOE through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in South Texas, the Permian Basin and California.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserves transfers of 178 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2011 development programs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S4	Occidental incurred approximately $2.7 billion in 2011 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S5	Permian, California, Midcontinent, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain accounted for approximately 89 percent of the reserves transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P90_S6	Costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves have increased over time and costs of transfers to proved developed reserves may continue to increase.
797468_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2011, were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental toward the development of reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserves volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The current Senior Director of Worldwide Reserves and Reservoir Engineering is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.
797468_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe.
797468_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.
797468_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation.
797468_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Classification.
797468_12_ITEM7_P97_S4	He is also an active member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training (JCORET).
797468_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Senior Director has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) consisting of senior corporate officers to monitor, review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	In 2011, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of Occidental s methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2011, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory standards.
797468_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2011 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	In 2011, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 76 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
797468_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes generally increased throughout 2011, settling at $98.83 per barrel and $107.38 per barrel as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Oil prices will continue to be affected by (i) global supply and demand, which is generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, currency exchange rates, and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments, and (ii) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	These factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil prices reliably.
797468_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Occidental continues to adjust to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	The volatility in all of these markets makes it impossible to predict NGL prices reliably.
797468_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	These and other factors can cause prices to be volatile, making it impossible to forecast gas prices reliably.
797468_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	Chemical segment earnings increased in 2011 as certain economies continued to recover from the global economic downturn.
797468_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	Higher margins across most product lines were achieved as prices more than offset higher feedstock costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	During 2011, United States and international manufacturing sectors continued to recover from the global economic downturn resulting in strong demand and pricing for basic chemical products.
797468_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	Industry chlorine production increased by 2 percent, compared to 2010, as chlorine demand in emerging economies continued to outpace United States demand.
797468_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives remained competitive in offshore markets as a result of the North America feedstock cost advantages, which are driven mostly by natural gas prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P111_S3	Pricing for liquid caustic soda improved each quarter of 2011 partly as a result of major global events, including the devastating tsunami in Japan, which led to an increase in exports of 7 percent over 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P111_S4	Chlorine prices remained steady throughout the year, and began to decrease during the fourth quarter due to seasonal slowdowns, which negatively impacted overall chlorine demand.
797468_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Year-over-year domestic vinyls demand fell 3.6 percent due to the persistent low demand from the housing and commercial construction markets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Consequently, domestic operating rates in 2011 were down 1 percent compared to 2010, and margins also decreased in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	However, North American-produced ethylene continues to cost significantly less compared to costs in Europe and Asia, giving North American vinyl products an advantage in global markets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	As a result, Occidental's vinyl exports in 2011 were 19 percent higher compared to 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Future performance will depend on the recovery of domestic housing and construction markets, positive global economic activity, and the cost competitiveness of United States feedstock and energy pricing compared to global markets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Occidental expects that if the United States housing, automotive and durable goods sectors continue to improve, it should experience higher domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	With the stronger demand, chlorine and caustic soda margins would be expected to generally remain at 2011 levels.
797468_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	The continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on United States feedstock costs remaining favorable compared to other global markets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	If the United States economy continues to improve, domestic demand for vinyls and operating rates would also be expected to improve in 2012, which should result in better domestic margins.
797468_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	Occidental expects export demand to remain firm, but for margins to be challenged as North American ethylene producers operate near capacity reducing the United States cost advantages compared to other vinyl producing regions of the world.
797468_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing and transportation assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The marketing and trading businesses earn margins from trading oil, gas and other commodities, marketing the oil and gas segment's products and storage activity.
797468_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	Earnings related to processing and transportation are affected by the volumes that are processed at, and transported through, the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	The midstream and marketing segment earnings were modestly lower in 2011, compared to 2010, reflecting lower marketing and trading income, partially offset by higher pipeline income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The marketing and trading group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, trades around the midstream and marketing segment assets and engages in commodities trading.
797468_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from partners, producers and third parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its midstream and marketing assets, such as pipelines, processing plants and storage facilities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to maximize prices received for Occidental s production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	In addition, Occidental s Phibro trading unit's strategy is to profit from market price changes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	Marketing and trading earnings are affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	In 2011, the marketing and trading group earnings decreased due to lower trading results.
797468_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas by-products, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	Occidental s 2011 earnings from these operations improved compared to 2010, due to higher gas processing volumes and higher NGL prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE.
797468_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Through its 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy, the Dolphin Pipeline investment contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results.
797468_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has a capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 Bcf per day.
797468_12_ITEM7_P124_S3	Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman has grown and Dolphin Energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies.
797468_12_ITEM7_P124_S4	To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar.
797468_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Occidental owns an oil-gathering, common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,700 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 365,000 barrels per day, 5.8 million barrels of active storage capability as well as 64 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Occidental owns approximately 35 percent of the General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains Pipeline), an oil and gas pipeline transportation, storage, terminalling and marketing entity.
797468_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Occidental s 2011 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to better revenues and margins from all of these assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Earnings from power generation facilities are derived from the sales of steam and power to affiliates and third parties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	Occidental s 2011 earnings from these facilities were flat compared to 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	On December 31, 2010, Occidental completed its acquisition of the remaining 50-percent joint-venture interest in Elk Hills Power, LLC (EHP), a limited liability company that operates a gas-fired power-generation plant in California, bringing Occidental's total ownership to 100 percent.
797468_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGL prices, which cannot be predicted.
797468_12_ITEM7_P130_S2	Generally, higher NGL prices result in higher profitability.
797468_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	The trading and marketing business is inherently volatile.
797468_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Based on its framework of controls and risk management systems, Occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole.
797468_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.

797468_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	The increase reflected higher oil and NGL prices and volumes, partially offset by higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rates and higher operating costs, including higher field support, workover and well maintenance expenses driven by Occidental s program to increase production at current high oil prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	Daily oil and gas production volumes were 733,000 BOE for 2011, compared with 711,000 BOE for 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	The increase was mainly due to acquisitions in South Texas, California and the Williston Basin, including the effect of post-acquisition capital investment, and higher production in Oman s Mukhaizna Field and Iraq, which were partially offset by lower production in Libya.
797468_12_ITEM7_P148_S2	Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Colombia and Long Beach by higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting PSCs by 18,000 BOE per day.

797468_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	The increase reflected higher average worldwide oil, NGL and domestic natural gas prices and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses partly resulting from fully expensing CO 2 , higher field support and workover expenses and higher DD A rates.
797468_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	Daily oil and gas production volumes were 711,000 BOE for 2010, compared with 677,000 BOE for 2009.
797468_12_ITEM7_P150_S1	The increase was mainly due to the new production in Bahrain, higher production in the Mukhaizna Field in Oman, and gas production from domestic assets, which were partially offset by a decline in Colombia.
797468_12_ITEM7_P150_S2	Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia by higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting PSCs by 16,000 BOE per day.

797468_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2011 were $448 million, compared to $472 million in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	The 2011 results reflected lower marketing and trading income, partially offset by higher pipeline income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2010 were $472 million, compared to $235 million in 2009.
797468_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The 2010 results reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading and gas processing businesses and increased earnings in the pipeline business.

797468_12_ITEM7_P160_S2	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	Occidental s 2011 worldwide tax rate was 39 percent, slightly lower than 2010 and 2009 due to higher proportionate domestic pre-tax income in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	The 2011 income tax expense included a net $21 million charge for out-of-period state income taxes.

797468_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	Changes in components of Occidental's results of operations are discussed below:
797468_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	The increase in net sales in 2011, compared to 2010, was due to higher oil and NGL prices, higher oil and gas segment volumes and higher sales, including higher export sales, across most chemical products.
797468_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	Price and volume increases in the oil and gas segment represented approximately 84 percent of the overall increase while chemical segment price and volume increases represented 16 percent of the increase.
797468_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	The increase in net sales in 2010, compared to 2009, was primarily due to higher oil, NGLs, gas and chemical product prices and volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	Price and volume increases in the oil and gas segment represented approximately 71 percent of the overall increase, chemical volume and price increases represented 19 percent and midstream and marketing represented the remaining increase.
797468_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to higher oil and gas volumes, higher oil and gas operating costs, mostly resulting from higher workover and well maintenance activity and higher feedstock costs in the chemical segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher oil and gas production costs, partly resulting from the effects of fully expensing CO 2 costs in 2010, as well as higher field operating, workover and well maintenance costs, and higher volumes; and higher chemical volumes, energy and feedstock costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2011 due to higher headcount and environmental remediation expense and the Colombia net worth tax.
797468_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher compensation costs, in particular, equity compensation expense due to higher stock prices in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	DD A increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to higher DD A rates and volumes in the oil and gas segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	The DD A rate is expected to further increase in 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	DD A increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher DD A rates and volumes, including a full year of operations in Bahrain.
797468_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Taxes other than on income increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to higher realized domestic oil prices and volumes and higher domestic ad valorem taxes resulting from increased property values.
797468_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	Taxes other than on income increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher production taxes for Permian and Midcontinent resulting from higher realized domestic oil and natural gas prices and higher ad valorem taxes in Permian resulting from increased property values.
797468_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	Exploration expense was comparable for 2011, 2010 and 2009.
797468_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	Charges for impairments in 2010 predominately related to gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	Interest and debt expense, net, increased in 2011, compared to 2010, mainly due to the $163 million early debt extinguishment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	Interest and debt expense, net, decreased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to lower average interest rates during 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	Provision for domestic and foreign income taxes increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	The lower tax rate is due to higher proportionate domestic pre-tax income in 2011, compared to 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	Provision for domestic and foreign income taxes increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to higher income before taxes in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	The worldwide effective tax rate in 2010 was comparable to 2009.
797468_12_ITEM7_P179_S2	The 2010 income tax expense included an $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	Income from equity investments increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to an additional investment in the Plains Pipeline in late 2010 and its higher earnings.
797468_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	Discontinued operations, net, in 2011 primarily reflected the $144 million after-tax gain recorded from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	Discontinued operations, net, in 2010 primarily reflected the after-tax losses in the Argentine operations held for sale.
797468_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	The 2009 amount included after-tax impairment charges of $111 million for producing properties in Argentina.
797468_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	There was no noncontrolling interest in 2011 due to the restructuring of Occidental s Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets as of December 31, 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	The changes in the following components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents.
797468_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	The increase in trade receivables, net, was due to higher oil and NGL prices and volumes in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	The decrease in assets of discontinued operations was due to the sale of Occidental s Argentine operations, which closed in February 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	The decrease in prepaid expenses and other reflected the closing of the South Texas acquisition in January 2011, for which a deposit was made in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	The increase in PP E, net, was due to capital expenditures and the acquisitions of oil and gas properties, partially offset by DD A.
797468_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	The increase in the accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances reflected higher capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	The decrease in liabilities of discontinued operations was due to the sale of Occidental s Argentine operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	The increase in long-term debt, net, was due to the issuance of $2.15 billion of senior unsecured notes in August 2011, partially offset by the redemption of $1.4 billion of senior notes in March 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes was due to higher capital expenditures in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P190_S1	The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities other reflected the long-term portion of liabilities related to the higher asset retirement obligations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P190_S2	The increase in stockholders equity reflected net income for 2011, partially offset by dividend payments and treasury stock purchases.
797468_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	At December 31, 2011, Occidental had approximately $3.8 billion in cash on hand, a substantial majority of which is held domestically.
797468_12_ITEM7_P191_S1	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and sales volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P191_S2	Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.
797468_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	Occidental's available but unused committed bank credit was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P192_S1	In October 2011, Occidental entered into a new five-year $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2011 Credit Facility), which replaced its previous $1.4 billion bank credit facility (2006 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to expire in September 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P192_S2	The 2011 Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if Occidental files for bankruptcy.
797468_12_ITEM7_P192_S3	Up to $1.0 billion of the 2011 Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_12_ITEM7_P192_S4	Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2011 Credit Facility or the 2006 Credit Facility during 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	The 2011 Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or permit the lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_12_ITEM7_P193_S1	Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_12_ITEM7_P193_S2	Additionally, Occidental paid prorated annual facility fees of 0.10 percent and 0.05 percent, respectively, in 2011 on the total commitment amounts of the 2011 Credit Facility and the 2006 Credit Facility based on Occidental s senior debt ratings.
797468_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	Occidental has a shelf registration statement that facilitates issuing senior debt securities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P194_S1	In August 2011, Occidental issued $2.15 billion of debt under this shelf, which comprised $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $900 million of 3.125-percent senior unsecured notes due 2022.
797468_12_ITEM7_P194_S2	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P194_S3	Interest on the notes will be payable semiannually in arrears in February and August of each year for both series of notes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	In March 2011, Occidental redeemed all $1.0 billion of its outstanding 7-percent senior notes due 2013 and all $368 million of its outstanding 6.75-percent senior notes due 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P195_S1	Occidental recorded a $163 million pre-tax charge related to this redemption in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	Occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for long-term and short-term funding for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	At this time, Occidental does not anticipate any needs for such funding.
797468_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	As of December 31, 2011, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	The most important sources of the increase in operating cash flow in 2011, compared to 2010, were higher worldwide oil and NGLs prices and volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	In 2011, compared to 2010, Occidental s global realized oil and NGL prices increased 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P199_S1	In 2011, Occidental s oil and NGL production accounted for 71 percent of its total net sales.
797468_12_ITEM7_P199_S2	In 2011, oil volumes increased, compared to 2010, mainly due to acquisitions in California and the Williston Basin, including the effect of post-acquisition capital investment, and higher production in Oman s Mukhaizna Field and Iraq, which were partially offset by lower production in Libya.
797468_12_ITEM7_P199_S3	Increases in field support, workover and well maintenance costs in 2011, compared to 2010, partially offset the increases in prices and volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P200_S0	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_12_ITEM7_P200_S1	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than oil and NGL prices and volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P201_S0	The increase in operating cash flows in 2011, compared to 2010, also reflected high chemical product prices and margins for most products .
797468_12_ITEM7_P202_S0	In 2010, compared to 2009, Occidental s global realized oil and United States natural gas prices for continuing operations each increased by 31 percent.
797468_12_ITEM7_P202_S1	In 2010, Occidental's United States gas production represented approximately 59 percent of its worldwide natural gas production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P202_S2	Occidental s 2010 oil and gas sales volumes increased, compared to 2009, mainly due to the new production from Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna Field in Oman and higher domestic gas production, partially offset by a decline in Colombia.
797468_12_ITEM7_P202_S3	Increases in field support, workover and well maintenance costs in 2010, compared to 2009, partially offset the increases in prices and volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P203_S0	The increase in operating cash flows in 2010, compared to 2009, also reflected higher chemical product prices for PVC, VCM, ethylene dichloride (EDC) and chlorine, which resulted in higher margins.
797468_12_ITEM7_P203_S1	In addition, all chemical product volumes increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to improved market conditions, particularly for exports.
797468_12_ITEM7_P203_S2	The 2010 operating cash flows also reflected higher margins in the marketing and trading and gas processing businesses and increased earnings in the pipeline business.
797468_12_ITEM7_P204_S0	In general, the overall impact of the chemical and midstream and marketing segments margins was less significant than the changes in oil and gas segment prices because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments' earnings and cash flows are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P205_S0	Other non-cash charges to income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 included charges for stock-based compensation plans and asset retirement obligation accruals.
797468_12_ITEM7_P205_S1	The 2010 amount included a $275 million charge for asset impairments, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_12_ITEM7_P206_S0	Operating cash flows for discontinued operations include the Argentine operations through the date they were sold in February 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P206_S1	The 2009 amounts included after-tax charges of $111 million for asset impairments of certain Argentine producing properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P207_S0	The increase in capital expenditures of $3.6 billion from 2010 to 2011 was mainly due to the $3.0 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures, which reflected Occidental s share of development costs in Oman and Bahrain, and higher spending in domestic properties in California, the Permian Basin, South Texas and the Williston Basin.
797468_12_ITEM7_P207_S1	Occidental s United States operated rig activity increased 89 percent from 38 rigs at year-end 2010 to 72 rigs at year-end 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P208_S0	Occidental s capital spending for 2012 is expected to be approximately $8.3 billion and will be focused on increasing oil and gas production and ensuring Occidental's returns remain well above its cost of capital given current oil and gas prices and the cost environment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P209_S0	The increase in capital expenditures in 2012 from $7.5 billion in 2011 will be allocated to the oil and gas segment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P209_S1	Of the $8.3 billion 2012 capital spending, the oil and gas, midstream and marketing, and chemical segments will receive 84 percent, 11 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P210_S0	The 2011 other investing activities, net amount included $4.9 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, including various interests in domestic oil and gas properties, in operated, producing and non-producing properties in California and the Permian and Williston Basins for approximately $2.4 billion, properties in South Texas for $1.8 billion and $0.5 billion for Occidental s share of pre-acquisition development expenditures incurred by the Al Hosn Gas Project .

797468_12_ITEM7_P212_S0	The 2009 other investing activities, net amount included $1.7 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, including acquisitions of various oil and gas properties in California and the Permian Basin for approximately $610 million, interests in Phibro for approximately $370 million, additional interests in Plains Pipeline for approximately $330 million and various other acquisitions totaling approximately $320 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P212_S1	The 2009 amount also included foreign signing bonuses of approximately $190 million, the bulk of which was scheduled under the 2008 Libya agreements.
797468_12_ITEM7_P213_S0	Investing cash flow from discontinued operations included $2.6 billion of cash received from the sale of the Argentine operations in 2011, and capital expenditures of $310 million and $336 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P214_S0	Commitments at December 31, 2011, for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2012 and thereafter were approximately $2.0 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P214_S1	Occidental expects to fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P215_S0	The 2011 amount included net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the August 2011 issuance of senior unsecured notes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P215_S1	The 2011 amount also included financing cash flow use of $1.5 billion to retire other long-term debt, purchases of treasury stock of $274 million and $121 million of distributions to a noncontrolling interest partner.
797468_12_ITEM7_P216_S0	The 2010 amount included net proceeds of approximately $2.6 billion from the December 2010 issuance of senior unsecured notes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P216_S1	The 2010 amount also included financing cash flow use of $311 million to retire other long-term debt.
797468_12_ITEM7_P217_S0	The 2009 amount included net proceeds of $740 million from the issuance of 4.125-percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 and Occidental s payment of $600 million of debt associated with Dolphin Energy.
797468_12_ITEM7_P218_S0	Occidental also paid common stock dividends of $1.4 billion in 2011, $1.2 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in 2009.
797468_12_ITEM7_P219_S0	In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives.
797468_12_ITEM7_P219_S1	Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P219_S2	Some of these projects, transactions and commitments (off-balance-sheet arrangements) are not reflected on Occidental s balance sheets, as a result of the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to their specific terms.
797468_12_ITEM7_P219_S3	The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these off-balance-sheet arrangements.
797468_12_ITEM7_P220_S0	Occidental has guaranteed certain equity investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_12_ITEM7_P220_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on $300 million of Dolphin s debt, for which the fair value was immaterial.
797468_12_ITEM7_P221_S0	See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Qatar" and Segment Results of Operations for further information about Dolphin.
797468_12_ITEM7_P222_S0	Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_12_ITEM7_P222_S1	Occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility.
797468_12_ITEM7_P222_S2	Lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales.
797468_12_ITEM7_P223_S0	The table below summarizes and cross-references Occidental s contractual obligations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P223_S1	This summary indicates those obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011, as well as those that are not.
797468_12_ITEM7_P224_S0	Excludes unamortized debt discount and interest on the debt.
797468_12_ITEM7_P224_S1	As of December 31, 2011, interest on long-term debt totaling $1.5 billion is payable in the following years (in millions): 2012 - $189, 2013 and 2014 - $369, 2015 and 2016 - $326, 2017 and thereafter - $597.
797468_12_ITEM7_P225_S0	Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, as well as certain accrued liabilities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P226_S0	Amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P227_S0	Amounts represent payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business.
797468_12_ITEM7_P227_S1	Some of these arrangements involve take-or-pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P228_S0	Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.2-percent discount rate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P229_S0	Amounts exclude certain oil purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum amounts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P230_S0	Amounts represent agreements Occidental has entered into providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_12_ITEM7_P231_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are named, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_12_ITEM7_P231_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_12_ITEM7_P231_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief; however, Occidental or such subsidiaries are usually among many companies in these proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_12_ITEM7_P232_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM7_P233_S0	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P233_S1	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible additional losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_12_ITEM7_P234_S0	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_12_ITEM7_P234_S1	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P234_S2	Environmental matters are further discussed under the caption "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" below.
797468_12_ITEM7_P235_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P235_S1	While the audits of corporate tax returns for taxable years through 2009 have concluded for United States federal income tax purposes, the 2010 and 2011 taxable years are currently under review by the United States Internal Revenue Service pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program.
797468_12_ITEM7_P235_S2	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P235_S3	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental's income taxes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P236_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_12_ITEM7_P236_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P237_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM7_P237_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_12_ITEM7_P237_S2	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P238_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_12_ITEM7_P238_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.
797468_12_ITEM7_P238_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_12_ITEM7_P239_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P239_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P239_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_12_ITEM7_P240_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P241_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 160 sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P241_S1	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites, as follows:
797468_12_ITEM7_P242_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 10 of the 160 sites described above, and 107 of the sites had reserves from zero to $1 million each.
797468_12_ITEM7_P243_S0	As of December 31, 2011, two landfills in western New York owned by Occidental accounted for 64 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P243_S1	Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 13 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P244_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 9 of the 73 third-party sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P244_S1	Two of the remaining 64 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee and a containment and removal project in Tennessee accounted for 44 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P245_S0	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 61 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P245_S1	Two other sites a former chemical plant in Tennessee and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 42 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_12_ITEM7_P246_S0	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_12_ITEM7_P247_S0	Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves over the next four years and the balance over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_12_ITEM7_P247_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at the sites described above could be up to $375 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P247_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_12_ITEM7_P248_S0	Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for the years ended December 31:
797468_12_ITEM7_P249_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_12_ITEM7_P250_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P250_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P251_S0	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $160 million for 2012.
797468_12_ITEM7_P252_S0	Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_12_ITEM7_P252_S1	At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $11 billion, or approximately 18 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_12_ITEM7_P252_S2	Of such assets, approximately $9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately $1.4 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_12_ITEM7_P252_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, net sales outside North America totaled $8.7 billion, or approximately 36 percent of total net sales.
797468_12_ITEM7_P253_S0	The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P253_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates.
797468_12_ITEM7_P253_S2	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_12_ITEM7_P253_S3	There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years.
797468_12_ITEM7_P253_S4	The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_12_ITEM7_P254_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_12_ITEM7_P254_S1	For business acquisitions, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_12_ITEM7_P255_S0	Interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P256_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P256_S1	Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized.
797468_12_ITEM7_P256_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_12_ITEM7_P256_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_12_ITEM7_P256_S4	Otherwise, the costs of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense.
797468_12_ITEM7_P257_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_12_ITEM7_P257_S1	Occidental's practice is generally to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_12_ITEM7_P258_S0	Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.
797468_12_ITEM7_P259_S0	Occidental s policy is to expense the costs of injectants for secondary and tertiary recovery.
797468_12_ITEM7_P260_S0	Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties are determined by the unit-of-production method.
797468_12_ITEM7_P260_S1	Leasehold acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves, while capitalized development and successful exploration costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P261_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_12_ITEM7_P261_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_12_ITEM7_P262_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S0	share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S1	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S2	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S3	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S4	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S5	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S6	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S7	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_12_ITEM7_P263_S8	In 2011, revisions of previous estimates provided a net 214 million BOE reduction to proved reserves, which amounted to less than 7 percent of Occidental's total reserves as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P264_S0	The most significant financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves would be to the DD A rate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P264_S1	For example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.75 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by $200 million annually at current production rates.
797468_12_ITEM7_P264_S2	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S1	At December 31, 2011, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $4.9 billion.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will become subject to DD A.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_12_ITEM7_P265_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S0	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S1	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S2	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S3	Fluctuations in commodity prices and production and development costs could cause management's plans to change with respect to unproved properties and could cause the carrying values of proved properties to be unrealizable.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S4	Such circumstances could result in impairments in the carrying values of proved or unproved properties or both.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S5	For example, if natural gas prices in the United States remain depressed for an extended period, management s plans for certain domestic gas assets may change and some of its investments may become impaired.
797468_12_ITEM7_P266_S6	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S0	Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_12_ITEM7_P267_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P268_S0	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_12_ITEM7_P268_S1	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P269_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P269_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM7_P270_S0	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.5 billion and its depreciation expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $300 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P270_S1	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_12_ITEM7_P271_S0	year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $40 million per year.
797468_12_ITEM7_P272_S0	Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_12_ITEM7_P272_S1	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for such treatment and management elects to do so.
797468_12_ITEM7_P273_S0	If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated and documented as a cash-flow hedge, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_12_ITEM7_P273_S1	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_12_ITEM7_P273_S2	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P274_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions.
797468_12_ITEM7_P275_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P275_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the year ended December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P276_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_12_ITEM7_P277_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_12_ITEM7_P277_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_12_ITEM7_P278_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_12_ITEM7_P279_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_12_ITEM7_P279_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM7_P280_S0	Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques, in a three-level fair value hierarchy: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P280_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_12_ITEM7_P281_S0	Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P282_S0	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_12_ITEM7_P282_S1	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_12_ITEM7_P282_S2	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_12_ITEM7_P283_S0	Trading securities Quoted prices in active markets exist and are used to provide fair values for these instruments.
797468_12_ITEM7_P283_S1	These securities are classified as Level 1.
797468_12_ITEM7_P284_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_12_ITEM7_P284_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_12_ITEM7_P285_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial commodity contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_12_ITEM7_P285_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_12_ITEM7_P285_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_12_ITEM7_P286_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_12_ITEM7_P286_S1	This approach utilizes management's best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a risk-adjusted risk-free discount rate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P287_S0	Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P287_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM7_P287_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_12_ITEM7_P287_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_12_ITEM7_P287_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_12_ITEM7_P288_S0	payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_12_ITEM7_P289_S0	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_12_ITEM7_P290_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_12_ITEM7_P291_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_12_ITEM7_P291_S1	As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_12_ITEM7_P292_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional loss.
797468_12_ITEM7_P292_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) the regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; and (5) laws and regulations may impose more or less stringent remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability.
797468_12_ITEM7_P293_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P293_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_12_ITEM7_P293_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_12_ITEM7_P294_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_12_ITEM7_P294_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_12_ITEM7_P295_S0	If Occidental adjusts the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_12_ITEM7_P295_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $36 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P295_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $36 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P296_S0	Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P296_S1	Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM7_P296_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_12_ITEM7_P296_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_12_ITEM7_P297_S0	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P297_S1	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions and the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors.
797468_12_ITEM7_P297_S2	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Other Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_12_ITEM7_P298_S0	Pursuant to a new rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Occidental moved the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income to consecutively follow the Consolidated Statements of Income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P298_S1	Occidental early-adopted the rule, as permitted, in the fourth quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S0	Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax income by approximately $150 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S2	If domestic natural gas prices vary by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $125 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S3	As production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to oil and gas prices also will change.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S4	The trading and marketing results are also sensitive to price changes of oil, gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P299_S5	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on trading and marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_12_ITEM7_P300_S0	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_12_ITEM7_P300_S1	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P300_S2	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $25 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P300_S3	A variation in ethylene dichloride (EDC) prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $5 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P301_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the margin effect of price changes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P301_S1	According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2011 average contract prices were: chlorine $288 per ton, caustic soda $615 per ton, PVC $0.75 per lb.
797468_12_ITEM7_P302_S0	Through its marketing and trading activities and within its established policy controls and procedures, Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to improve realized prices for its oil and gas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P302_S1	Additionally, Occidental s Phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P302_S2	In the past, Occidental has also used derivatives to reduce its exposure to price volatility on a small portion of its oil and gas production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S0	Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by certain members of management embedded in the marketing and trading operations in order to manage risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S2	These members of management report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S3	The President and Chief Executive Officer and risk committees comprising members of Occidental's senior corporate management also oversee these controls.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S4	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_12_ITEM7_P303_S5	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_12_ITEM7_P304_S0	As part of its third-party marketing and trading activities, Occidental enters into purchase and sale contracts for oil and gas.
797468_12_ITEM7_P304_S1	Occidental manages these contracts so that the aggregate terms and volumes of the purchases and sales generally approximate each other.
797468_12_ITEM7_P304_S2	The following table shows the changes in the net fair value of Occidental s marketing and trading derivative contracts during 2011 and 2010:
797468_12_ITEM7_P305_S0	The following table shows the fair value of derivatives, segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_12_ITEM7_P306_S0	Throughout 2011, Occidental held a series of collar agreements that qualified as cash-flow hedges for the sale of approximately 3 percent of its oil production.
797468_12_ITEM7_P306_S1	These agreements were for existing domestic production and terminated as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P306_S2	The collar agreements hedged the sale of 12,000 barrels per day at a weighted-average strike price that ranged from $32.92 to $46.27.
797468_12_ITEM7_P307_S0	In 2009, Occidental entered into financial swap agreements for the sale of a portion of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_12_ITEM7_P308_S0	The following table presents the daily quantities and weighted-average prices that will be received by Occidental as of December 31, 2011:
797468_12_ITEM7_P309_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental's North American leased storage facilities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P310_S0	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P310_S1	These derivative agreements continue through January 2013.
797468_12_ITEM7_P311_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental had approximately 25 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage.
797468_12_ITEM7_P311_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 35 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage.
797468_12_ITEM7_P312_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the total fair value of cash-flow hedges, which was a net asset of $39 million, was included in the total fair value (a net liability of $13 million) in the tables in "Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts" above.
797468_12_ITEM7_P313_S0	Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P313_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95-percent level of confidence.
797468_12_ITEM7_P313_S2	The marketing and trading value at risk determined with this method was immaterial during 2011.
797468_12_ITEM7_P314_S0	On December 31, 2009, Occidental acquired Phibro, which trades oil, gas and other commodities.
797468_12_ITEM7_P314_S1	Occidental determined that operations of Phibro are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
797468_12_ITEM7_P314_S2	This conclusion is based primarily on the trading limits Occidental placed on the unit, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, value at risk and credit, as well as the highly liquid positions the operation maintains, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_12_ITEM7_P315_S0	Occidental sells a portion of its oil, NGLs and natural gas from its operations, as well as volumes from third parties, under a variety of contractual obligations that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity.
797468_12_ITEM7_P316_S0	United States, is approximately 107 million barrels of oil, 358 billion cubic feet of gas and immaterial amounts of NGLs.
797468_12_ITEM7_P316_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental had purchase contracts to fulfill a substantial portion of these obligations and believes that it has sufficient production and existing volumes in storage, as well as the ability to fulfill the remaining obligations with contractual purchases, and that, to the extent it has any shortfall in sourcing the required quantities, it believes it has the ability to secure such volumes in the spot market.
797468_12_ITEM7_P317_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not expected to be material.
797468_12_ITEM7_P317_S1	As of December 31, 2011, variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_12_ITEM7_P318_S0	The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_12_ITEM7_P318_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_12_ITEM7_P319_S0	Excludes unamortized net discounts of $33 million.
797468_12_ITEM7_P320_S0	Occidental s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P320_S1	Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis, and master netting agreements are used when appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P320_S2	Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits.
797468_12_ITEM7_P320_S3	Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure.
797468_12_ITEM7_P321_S0	A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
797468_12_ITEM7_P321_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_12_ITEM7_P322_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_12_ITEM7_P322_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM7_P322_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_12_ITEM7_P323_S0	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_12_ITEM7_P323_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Occidental had a net liability of $58 million and $234 million, respectively, for which the amount of collateral posted was $27 million and $10 million, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM7_P323_S2	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
797468_12_ITEM7_P324_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties.
797468_12_ITEM7_P324_S1	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2011 was not material.
797468_12_ITEM7_P324_S2	Losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented.
797468_12_ITEM7_P325_S0	Occidental s foreign operations have currency risk.
797468_12_ITEM7_P325_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_12_ITEM7_P325_S2	Most international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_12_ITEM7_P325_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_12_ITEM7_P325_S4	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_12_ITEM7_P326_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_12_ITEM7_P327_S0	Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 (including the information appearing under the captions "Business and Properties Competition and Sales and Marketing") and Items 7 and 7A (including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub captions "Strategy," "Oil and Gas Segment Proved Reserves" and " Industry Outlook," "Chemical Segment Industry Outlook," "Midstream, Marketing and Other Segment Industry Outlook," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Lawsuits, Claims and Other Contingencies," "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," and "Derivative Activities and Market Risk"), contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.

797468_12_ITEM7_P328_S2	Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
797468_12_ITEM7_P329_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include items noted in Item 1A "Risk Factors," and elsewhere.
797468_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2011 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule.
797468_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
797468_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
797468_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_12_ITEM8_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	On December 31, 2010, Occidental restructured its Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	In this report, "Occidental" or "the Company" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Occidental is a multinational organization whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the oil and gas, chemical and midstream, marketing and other segments.
797468_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, treats, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	It also trades around its assets, including pipelines and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation.
797468_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a majority voting interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms, and for physical deliveries upon title transfer.
797468_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances.
797468_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_12_ITEM8_P34_S3	Management believes that these estimates and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial position and results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets originate and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $11 billion as of December 31, 2011, and net sales of approximately $8.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Since Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or market and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	For the chemical segment, Occidental's inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	For business acquisitions, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized.
797468_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_12_ITEM8_P46_S4	Otherwise, the costs of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense.
797468_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	Occidental's practice is generally to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.
797468_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Occidental s policy is to expense the costs of injectants for secondary and tertiary recovery.
797468_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties are determined by the unit-of-production method.
797468_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	Leasehold acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves, while capitalized development and successful exploration costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
797468_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	At December 31, 2011, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $4.9 billion.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will become subject to DD A.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_12_ITEM8_P53_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	Fluctuations in commodity prices and production and development costs could cause management's plans to change with respect to unproved properties and could cause the carrying values of proved properties to be unrealizable.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	Such circumstances could result in impairments in the carrying values of proved or unproved properties or both.
797468_12_ITEM8_P54_S5	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA) .
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_12_ITEM8_P55_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques, in a three-level fair value hierarchy: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Trading securities Quoted prices in active markets exist and are used to provide fair values for these instruments.
797468_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	These securities are classified as Level 1.
797468_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial commodity contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	This approach utilizes management's best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a risk-adjusted risk-free discount rate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $462 million and $470 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_12_ITEM8_P68_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional loss.
797468_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) the regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; and (5) laws and regulations may impose more or less stringent remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability.
797468_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted risk-free rate of interest.
797468_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the initial capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_12_ITEM8_P74_S4	Occidental has recorded no market risk premium in its liability since no reliable estimate can be made at this time.
797468_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	Occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated.
797468_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1,030 million and $762 million is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for such treatment and management elects to do so.
797468_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	If a derivative does not qualify or is not designated and documented as a cash-flow hedge, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions.
797468_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
797468_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy under each type of award issued under the Plans follows below.
797468_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock.
797468_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	For stock options (Options), stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), performance stock awards (PSAs) and total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using potential exercise values or estimated payout levels using Monte Carlo or other valuation models.
797468_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	Compensation expense for all awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_12_ITEM8_P86_S1	Compensation expense for PSAs and TSRIs is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the number of shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria using valuation models.
797468_12_ITEM8_P86_S2	In addition, every quarter, compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of RSUs, SARs, PSAs and TSRIs is adjusted for changes in the value of the underlying stock.
797468_12_ITEM8_P86_S3	The stock-settled portion of all these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P86_S4	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based payment transactions are considered participating securities prior to vesting, and, therefore, have been included in the earnings allocations in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	Occidental uses the fair value of assets to determine expected return on plan assets in calculating pension expense.
797468_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	Pension and postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S2	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S3	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S4	Some of the collateral Occidental receives for securities loaned includes investments in short-term investment funds.
797468_12_ITEM8_P92_S5	The short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $2.9 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately $635 million, $510 million and $484 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States.
797468_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	Additionally, net payments for income taxes related to discontinued operations were zero, $42 million and $4 million for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P93_S3	Production, property and other taxes paid related to discontinued operations were zero, $197 million and $100 million for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

797468_12_ITEM8_P93_S5	The 2011 interest paid included $154 million of debt extinguishment premiums.
797468_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.

797468_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	In early 2011, Occidental ceased exploration activity and its participation in production operations in Libya due to civil unrest in the country and United States sanctions.
797468_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	As a result, Occidental wrote off the entire amount of the capitalized and suspended exploration costs incurred to date, including lease acquisition costs, of approximately $35 million in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P100_S2	The United States government lifted its sanctions in September 2011 and Occidental resumed its participation in the producing operations at that time.

797468_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	Pursuant to a new rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Occidental moved the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income to consecutively follow the Consolidated Statements of Income.
797468_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	Occidental early adopted the rule, as permitted, in the fourth quarter of 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $176 million and $177 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

797468_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	In October 2011, Occidental entered into a new five-year, $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2011 Credit Facility) which replaced its previous $1.4 billion bank credit facility (2006 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to expire in September 2012.
797468_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	The 2011 Credit Facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if Occidental files for bankruptcy.
797468_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the 2011 Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_12_ITEM8_P113_S3	Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2011 Credit Facility or the 2006 Credit Facility during 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	The 2011 Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or permit the lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	Additionally, Occidental paid prorated annual facility fees of 0.10 percent and 0.05 percent, respectively, in 2011 on the total commitment amounts of the 2011 Credit Facility and the 2006 Credit Facility based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	In August 2011, Occidental issued $2.15 billion of debt, which comprised $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $900 million of 3.125-percent senior unsecured notes due 2022.
797468_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion.
797468_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August of each year for both series of notes.
797468_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	In March 2011, Occidental redeemed all $1.0 billion of its outstanding 7-percent senior notes due 2013 and all $368 million of its outstanding 6.75-percent senior notes due 2012.

797468_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	Occidental provided guarantees limited to certain political and other events.
797468_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on $300 million of Dolphin s debt, of which the fair value was immaterial.
797468_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	At December 31, 2011, minimum principal payments on long-term debt subsequent to December 31, 2011 aggregated $5.9 billion, of which zero is due in 2012, $0.6 billion in 2013, zero in 2014, zero in 2015, $1.5 billion in 2016 and $3.8 billion in 2017 and thereafter.
797468_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2011, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P122_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $6.4 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $5.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require it to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense.

797468_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	Through its marketing and trading activities and within its established policy controls and procedures, Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to improve realized prices for its oil and gas.
797468_12_ITEM8_P126_S1	Additionally, Occidental s Phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	In the past, Occidental has also used derivatives to reduce its exposure to price volatility on a small portion of its oil and gas production.
797468_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	Throughout 2011 and 2010, Occidental held a series of collar agreements that qualified as cash-flow hedges for the sale of approximately 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of its oil production.
797468_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	These agreements were for existing domestic production and terminated as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P128_S2	The collar agreements hedged the sale of 12,000 barrels per day at a weighted-average strike price that ranged from $32.92 to $46.35.
797468_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	In 2009, Occidental entered into financial swap agreements for the sale of a portion of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	The following table presents the daily quantities and weighted-average prices that will be received by Occidental as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
797468_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes.

797468_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from partners, producers and third parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its midstream and marketing assets, such as pipelines, processing plants and storage facilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P137_S1	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to maximize prices received for Occidental s production.
797468_12_ITEM8_P137_S2	The third-party marketing and trading purchase and sales contracts generally approximate each other with respect to aggregate volumes and terms.
797468_12_ITEM8_P137_S3	In addition, Occidental s Phibro trading unit's strategy is to profit from market price changes using derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.
797468_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following table presents gross volumes of Occidental s outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:

797468_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	Occidental has oil sales contracts representing a small portion of Occidental's domestic oil production.
797468_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	Additionally, for third-party marketing and trading activities, a substantial portion of the sales contracts that exist at the end of a reporting period are typically fulfilled by offsetting purchase contracts that have substantially identical terms entered into within a short time.
797468_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	For a substantial portion of the sales commitments not satisfied by such contracts as of December 31, 2011, Occidental entered into offsetting contracts after December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P140_S3	Occidental believes it has the ability to fulfill any remaining portion through its equity production or through additional third-party purchases.
797468_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	Approximately $1 million and $293 million of gains from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following tables present the gross fair value of Occidental s outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions):
797468_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the consolidated balance sheet.

797468_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
797468_12_ITEM8_P147_S1	Collateral of $173 million and $154 million deposited by Occidental for such contracts with clearing houses and brokers , which has not been reflected in the derivative fair value tables, is included in the marketing and trading assets and other balance as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_12_ITEM8_P149_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P149_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_12_ITEM8_P150_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Occidental had a net liability of $58 million and $234 million, respectively, for which the amount of collateral posted was $27 million and $10 million, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P150_S2	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
797468_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	Occidental s foreign operations have currency risk.
797468_12_ITEM8_P151_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_12_ITEM8_P151_S2	Most international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_12_ITEM8_P151_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.
797468_12_ITEM8_P152_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P153_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 160 sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($79 million in 2011, $79 million in 2010 and $84 million in 2009) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ($281 million in 2011, $287 million in 2010 and $319 million in 2009).
797468_12_ITEM8_P156_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA NPL (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites, as follows:
797468_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 10 of the 160 sites described above, and 107 of the sites had reserves from zero to $1 million each.
797468_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2011, two landfills in western New York owned by Occidental accounted for 64 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P158_S1	Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 13 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 9 of the 73 third-party sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	Two of the remaining 64 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee and a containment and removal project in Tennessee accounted for 44 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 61 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	Two other sites a former chemical plant in Tennessee and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 42 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years :
797468_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves over the next four years and the balance over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_12_ITEM8_P162_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at the sites described above could be up to $375 million.
797468_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for the years ended December 31:
797468_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_12_ITEM8_P165_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are named, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_12_ITEM8_P166_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_12_ITEM8_P166_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief; however, Occidental or such subsidiaries are usually among many companies in these proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_12_ITEM8_P167_S2	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_12_ITEM8_P168_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	While the audits of corporate tax returns for taxable years through 2009 have concluded for United States federal income tax purposes, the 2010 and 2011 taxable years are currently under review by the United States Internal Revenue Service pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program.
797468_12_ITEM8_P169_S2	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_12_ITEM8_P169_S3	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_12_ITEM8_P171_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P171_S2	At December 31, 2011, total purchase obligations were $7.9 billion, which included approximately $2.7 billion, $1.3 billion, $700 million, $450 million and $300 million that will be paid in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P171_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2012 and thereafter, which were approximately $2.0 billion.
797468_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM8_P172_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_12_ITEM8_P172_S2	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes and net of noncontrolling interest amounts were as follows:
797468_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	The provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States statutory federal income tax rate to Occidental s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:
797468_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	Included in total deferred tax assets was a current portion aggregating $200 million and $330 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that was reported in prepaid expenses and other.
797468_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_12_ITEM8_P177_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	Occidental has, as of December 31, 2011, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.2 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2021, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	Substantially all of Occidental's valuation allowance is provided for foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2011, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_12_ITEM8_P179_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $88 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $86 million in 2011, and income tax benefits of $26 million in 2010 and $147 million in 2009.
797468_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	Additional paid-in capital was credited $14 million in 2011, $22 million in 2010 and $24 million in 2009 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $67 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
797468_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next twelve months by a material amount.
797468_12_ITEM8_P186_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:
797468_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	Occidental has had a 95 million share repurchase program authorized since 2008; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.

797468_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	Occidental has established several Plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards in the form of RSUs, Options, SARs, PSAs and TSRIs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 14 million shares have been issued through December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P195_S2	Of the remaining shares, depending on the type of award granted, approximately 8.8 to 26.3 million shares are available for grants of future awards.
797468_12_ITEM8_P195_S3	During 2011, non-employee directors were granted awards for 64,800 shares of restricted stock that fully vested on the grant date.
797468_12_ITEM8_P195_S4	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following table summarizes certain stock-based incentive amounts for the past three years:
797468_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	Includes cash paid under the cash-settled SARs and the cash-settled portion of the PSAs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the PSAs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there was $193 million of pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense, based on year-end valuation, related to all unvested stock-based incentive award grants.
797468_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
797468_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	Certain employees are awarded the right to receive cash-settled RSUs, which are equivalent in value to actual shares of Occidental common stock but are paid in cash at the time of vesting.
797468_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	These awards vest either in total over two years or ratably over three years after the grant date and can be forfeited or accelerated under certain conditions.

797468_12_ITEM8_P227_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $19 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P227_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $34 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P228_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_12_ITEM8_P229_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2011 and the Hewitt Bond Universe yield curve in 2010.
797468_12_ITEM8_P229_S1	The weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental s past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation.
797468_12_ITEM8_P230_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_12_ITEM8_P230_S1	Occidental considers historical returns and correlation of equities and fixed income securities and current market factors such as inflation and interest rates.
797468_12_ITEM8_P231_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_12_ITEM8_P231_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 10.0 percent at both December 31, 2011 and 2010.
797468_12_ITEM8_P231_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from a low of 1.5 percent to a high of 10.0 percent in 2011, depending on local economic conditions.
797468_12_ITEM8_P231_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 5.8 percent and 6.8 percent in excess of local inflation in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P232_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates projected at an assumed Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 2.04 percent and 2.54 percent as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
797468_12_ITEM8_P232_S1	Beginning in 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_12_ITEM8_P232_S2	For those union employees, the health care cost trend rates were projected at annual rates ranging ratably from 9.0 percent in 2011 to 6.0 percent through the year 2017 and thereafter.
797468_12_ITEM8_P232_S3	A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of $40 million or a reduction of $36 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011, and a corresponding increase of $4 million or a reduction of $3 million in interest cost in 2011.
797468_12_ITEM8_P232_S4	The annual service costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_12_ITEM8_P233_S0	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan liabilities.

797468_12_ITEM8_P282_S1	This difference was caused by Occidental s PSCs in the Middle East/North Africa where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax.
797468_12_ITEM8_P282_S2	Occidental had historically reported these volumes as additional revenues and income taxes but not additional production and reserves.
797468_12_ITEM8_P282_S3	To simplify Occidental s reporting and to conform with industry practice, Occidental included these volumes in its reserves as of December 31, 2009.
797468_12_ITEM8_P282_S4	Beginning in 2010, Occidental s production volumes match revenues reported.
797468_12_ITEM8_P282_S5	For ease of comparison, prior year data for daily production volumes and for results per unit of production computations are shown using pre-tax amounts.

797468_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 24, 2012 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes , preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2011 .
797468_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Utah an d derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in certain production sharing and similar contracts for certain properties located in the Middle East in the countries of Bahrain, Libya and Oman.
797468_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold or saleable basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_12_ITEM15_P123_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on an equivalent barrel (BOE) basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.
797468_12_ITEM15_P123_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and over the recent past.
797468_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that c losely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, and (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_12_ITEM15_P127_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.

797468_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_12_ITEM15_P129_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_12_ITEM15_P131_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2011 ; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2011 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	Approximately 57 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	The remaining 43 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to a secondary or enhanced oil recovery response to water, CO 2 or steam injection.
797468_12_ITEM15_P138_S3	Th e data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	Approximately 53 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves are attributable to wells located in Libya where reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends prior to shut-in.
797468_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	The remaining 47 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the pr operties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Of the properties reviewed, approximately 49 percent of the proved producing reserves and 41 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of improved recovery techniques.
797468_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	These improved recovery techniques include water, CO 2 and steam injection and infill drilling.
797468_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows , Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2011 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The proved developed non- producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P152_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the countries of Bahrain, Libya and Oman reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S4	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in Libya and Oman include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S5	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_12_ITEM15_P156_S6	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_12_ITEM15_P158_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently is expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2011.
797468_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	Ryder Scott is an employee owned independent petroleum engineering consulting firm.
797468_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	We do not serve as officers or directors of any privately-owned or publicly-traded oil and gas company and are separate and independent from the operating and investment decision-making process of our clients.
797468_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	No single client or job represents a material portion of our annual revenue.
797468_12_ITEM15_P167_S3	These factors allow us to maintain our independence and objectivity in the performance of our services.
797468_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	Ryder Scott requires that staff engineers and geoscientists receive professional accreditation in the form of a registered or certified professional engineer s license or a registered or certified professional geoscientist s license, or the equivalent thereof, from an appropriate governmental authority or a recognized self-regulating professional organization.
797468_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	We are independent petroleum engineers with respect to Occidental.
797468_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	Neither we nor any of our employees have any interest in the subject properties and neither the employment to do this work nor the compensation is contingent on the results of our review.

797468_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and its chemical products.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Changes in consumption patterns, global and local economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, technological developments, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas, which, along with the effect of changes in market perceptions, contribute to price unpredictability and volatility.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Demand and, consequently, the price obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Occidental s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Results of operations, reserve replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire, develop or find additional reserves.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	During periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Occidental bears the risks of development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for drilling and other permits, equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Exploration is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Occidental may experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Occidental faces risks associated with its acquisitions and divestitures.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Occidental s acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices over the last few years; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on engineers' periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Concerns about climate change may affect Occidental s operations.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The U.S. federal government and the state of California have adopted, and other jurisdictions are considering, legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	For example, California s cap-and-trade program currently applies to Occidental's operations in the state.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate certain GHG emissions from both stationary and mobile sources.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international, national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	However, Occidental could face risks of project execution, higher costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions on the use of its products as a result of ongoing GHG reduction efforts.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The occurrence of events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed, may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Cyber attacks could significantly affect Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If, however, Occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed, the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In 2009 and 2010, Occidental experienced a cyber attack on its email system, which had no effect on its operations, financial systems or reputation.
797468_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_13_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Occidental has no unresolved SEC staff comments that have been outstanding more than 180 days at December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The New Mexico Environment Department asserted a penalty claim on April 6, 2012, against an OPC subsidiary for alleged notification, permitting and emissions violations of the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act at a facility in Lea County, New Mexico.
797468_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The subsidiary is evaluating this claim.
797468_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Although the matters described above are reportable events, their financial impact is expected to be insignificant.
797468_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	The current term of employment of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 3, 2013, organizational meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_13_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 32,200 stockholders of record at December 31, 2012 , and by approximately 494,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The quarterly financial data, which are included in this report after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	The quarterly dividends declared on the common stock were $0.54 for each quarter of 2012 ($2.16 for the year).
797468_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	On February 14, 2013 , a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2013 to stockholders of record on March 8, 2013 .
797468_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS All of Occidental's stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans is approximately 66 million , of which approximately 15 million had been issued through December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) Includes shares reserved to be issued pursuant to stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and performance-based awards.
797468_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	Shares for performance-based awards are included assuming maximum payout, but may be paid out at lesser amounts, or not at all, according to achievement of performance goals.
797468_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	(2) Price applies only to the Options and SARs included in column (a).
797468_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	Exercise price is not applicable to the other awards included in column (a).
797468_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	(3) A plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that otherwise would have been available for future awards.
797468_13_ITEM5_P4_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than the amount shown depending on the type of award granted.
797468_13_ITEM5_P4_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the amount shown may increase by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or cancelled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 , were as follows:
797468_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	(a) Includes shares purchased from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	(b) Occidental has had a 95 million share repurchase program authorized since 2008; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s peer group over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500 and (iii) each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the peer group, and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	Occidental's peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Total S.A. and Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	The information provided in this Performance Graph shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Exchange Act, other than as provided in Item 201 to Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act except to the extent Occidental specifically requests that it be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporates it by reference.
797468_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	_______________________ (1) The cumulative total return of the peer group companies' common stock includes the cumulative total return of Occidental's common stock.
797468_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	Note : Argentine operations were sold in February 2011 and have been reflected as discontinued operations for all applicable periods.
797468_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	A section of this report and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions and dispositions, discontinued operations and other items affecting comparability.
797468_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(c) Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end total shares of common stock outstanding, net of shares held as treasury stock, by the year-end closing stock price.
797468_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	(d) Includes $2.6 billion of cash received from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	(e) Includes the accelerated fourth quarter 2012 dividend payment, which normally would have been accrued as of year end but paid in the first quarter of the following year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments operated by OPC's subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	The segment also invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	STRATEGY General Occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet.
797468_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Occidental prioritizes the use of its cash flows in the following order:
797468_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Share repurchases Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Management aims to develop Occidental's assets in a manner that they would contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital.
797468_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The following describes the application of Occidental's overall strategy to each of its operating segments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Occidental prefers to hold large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective production.
797468_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Occidental also focuses a portion of its drilling activities on unconventional shale opportunities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development of such reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by:
797468_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures with an emphasis on transactions at attractive prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within its core areas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	In 2012, Occidental paid approximately $2.3 billion for domestic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin, the Williston Basin, California and South Texas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Management currently believes Occidental's growth will be most strongly affected by the success of the development plans for its Permian, California and Oman assets and the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi where it continues to deploy significant capital.
797468_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Occidental's oil and gas production has grown approximately five percent annually during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The primary objective of the chemical business is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The chemical segment's (OxyChem) strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC.
797468_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2012, OxyChem began construction of a chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee, which it expects to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The midstream and marketing segment is managed to generate returns on capital employed in excess of Occidental's cost of capital.
797468_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	In order to generate these returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other segments and third parties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	In marketing its own and third-party production, Occidental strives to maximize realized value using its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	In commodities trading, Occidental seeks to generate gains using net-long positions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The segment invests in and operates gas plants, co-generation facilities, pipeline systems and storage facilities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses and to limit credit risk exposure.
797468_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Occidental and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. are proceeding with the construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline which will transport crude oil between the Permian region and the Gulf Coast refinery markets and is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE).
797468_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Occidental also monitors other segment-specific indicators such as per-unit profit, production costs and finding and development costs, as well as health, environmental and safety measures, like the number of recordable injuries, and others.
797468_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Based on the $2.56 per share annual dividend rate announced in February 2013 , Occidental s dividend rate has increased by 412 percent since 2002.
797468_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	While its stockholders' equity increased by 6 percent for 2012 and 37 percent for the three-year period from 2010 through 2012 , Occidental continued to deliver above-cost-of-capital returns as follows:
797468_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The top figures for ROE and ROCE for 2012 were calculated by dividing Occidental's 2012 income after removing the effect of Significant Items Affecting Earnings described on page 24 (while adding back after-tax interest expense for the ROCE calculation) by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, during 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We provide this adjusted measure because we believe it would be useful to investors in evaluating and comparing Occidental's performance between periods, not as a substitute for the measure calculated using net income.
797468_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The bottom figure is the same calculation but using net income attributable to common stock in the numerator (while adding back after-tax interest expense for the ROCE calculation).
797468_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	(b) The three-year average ROE and ROCE were calculated by dividing Occidental's average net income attributable to common stock (while adding back after-tax interest expense for the ROCE calculation) over the three-year period 2010-2012 by its average equity and capital employed, respectively, over the same period.
797468_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Debt Structure Occidental issued $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2012 for general corporate purposes including ordinary course working capital increases, acquisitions, stock repurchases, retirement of debt and other business opportunities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a result of Occidental s commitment to financial discipline, its year-end 2012 total debt-to-capitalization (debt and equity) ratio was 16 percent.
797468_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short- and intermediate-term financial performance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2012 and 2011 :
797468_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2012 and 2011 :
797468_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Average realized oil prices were slightly higher in 2012 than 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Approximately 60 percent of Occidental s oil production tracks world oil prices, such as Brent, and 40 percent tracks WTI.
797468_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2012 decreased 35 percent from 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operations Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once production commences.
797468_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Of the total 8.1 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 74 percent is leased, 25 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Production-Sharing Contracts (PSC) Occidental has interests that are operated under PSCs or similar contracts in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar and Yemen.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition, Occidental's share of production and reserves from operations in Long Beach, California, and certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following chart shows Occidental s total volumes for the last five years:
797468_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Includes average production volumes per day of 5 thousand barrels (mbbl), 6 mbbl and 6 mbbl for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary.
797468_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Permian Occidental's Permian production is diversified across a large number of producing areas in the Permian Basin.
797468_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 15 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Occidental is the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 16 percent net share of the total oil production.
797468_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin.
797468_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	Occidental continued to increase its Permian interests in 2012 through various acquisitions, a significant portion of which related to its non-CO 2 operations which comprised approximately 1.5 million net acres at the end of 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Approximately 60 percent of Occidental s Permian oil production is from fields that actively employ CO 2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique.
797468_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	This technique involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	These CO 2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.
797468_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Occidental s interests in Permian offer significant additional development and exploitation potential.
797468_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	During 2012 , Occidental drilled approximately 550 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on third-party-operated properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Occidental's Permian non-CO 2 operations are among its fastest growing assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Since beginning significant delineation and development efforts in 2010, production from these operations has increased by more than 25 percent.
797468_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	The development program continued to increase in 2012 accounting for more than 300 of the wells drilled in Permian.
797468_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	Occidental's share of production in Permian was approximately 207,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	California Occidental's California operations include interests in the Elk Hills area, the Wilmington and other fields in the Los Angeles Basin and the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento Basins.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Occidental has properties in more than 125 fields in California, an increase from 2011 resulting from various property acquisitions in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Occidental's interests in the Elk Hills area include the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of California s San Joaquin Valley, which it operates with an approximate 78-percent interest, along with other adjacent properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Elk Hills Field is the largest producer of gas and NGLs in California.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	During 2012 , Occidental continued to invest in the Elk Hills area, performing infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques, resulting in approximately 320 new wells being drilled.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	Occidental began operating a new gas processing plant in Elk Hills in 2012 with capacity to handle 200 million cubic feet per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S6	Occidental's share of production in California was approximately 148,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S7	Occidental holds approximately 2.1 million net acres in California, the large majority of which are net fee mineral interests.
797468_13_ITEM7_P39_S8	As a result, Occidental has a substantial inventory of properties available for future development and exploitation in conventional areas, as well as unconventional prospects, such as shale.
797468_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Occidental drilled approximately 760 wells in California during 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Midcontinent and Other The Midcontinent and Other properties include interests in the Hugoton Field, the Piceance Basin, the Williston Basin, the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale and other areas in South Texas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	These properties are located in Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, West Virginia and Texas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Occidental holds over 2.3 million net acres in the Midcontinent region, which includes 1.4 million net acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the Hugoton area and approximately 0.4 million net acres in the Piceance area.
797468_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	Occidental also holds approximately 160,000 net acres in South Texas, including 4,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale, which was acquired in 2012.

797468_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	In Midcontinent and Other, Occidental drilled approximately 260 wells and produced approximately 110,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Other Developments Management conducted a review of Occidental s portfolio of oil and gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 and concluded that, given the current and anticipated natural gas pricing environment and the effect of reserve revisions from price changes and well performance, certain of its domestic natural gas producing properties had become impaired.
797468_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Occidental also concluded that certain projects had become uneconomical and that it would not pursue them.
797468_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a result, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.7 billion, almost all of which were for certain assets in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were more than $6 per Mcf.
797468_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Bahrain In 2009, Occidental and other consortium members began operating the Bahrain Field under a 20-year development and production sharing agreement (DPSA).
797468_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Occidental has a 48-percent working interest in the joint venture.
797468_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Since handover of operations, the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity more than 60 percent from an initial level of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26,000 barrels per day to 42,000 barrels per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	The consortium plans to continue growing gross gas production capacity to over 2.7 billion cubic feet per day and gross oil production to over 75,000 barrels per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Occidental's share of production from Bahrain during 2012 was approximately 232 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of gas and 4,000 barrels of oil per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Iraq In 2010, Occidental and other consortium members signed a 20-year contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field.
797468_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Occidental has a 23.44-percent interest in this contract, which entitles Occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee, as a result of having achieved an initial gross production threshold in 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The consortium plans to increase production to a contractually targeted production level of 1.2 million BOE per day by 2016 and maintain this level of production for seven years.
797468_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	Occidental's share of production from Iraq was approximately 11,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Libya Occidental participates with subsidiaries of the Libyan National Oil Company in Sirte Basin producing operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	The 2012 production volume was approximately 12,000 BOE per day.

797468_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	By the end of 2012 , Occidental had drilled almost 1,800 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	In 2012 , the average gross daily production was 120,000 BOE per day, which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in September 2005.
797468_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	The term for Block 9 continues through 2015, with a 10-year extension right for certain areas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P46_S5	The term for Block 27 expires in 2035.
797468_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	In 2008, Occidental was awarded a 20-year contract for Block 62, subject to declaration of commerciality, where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources.
797468_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Occidental's share of production from Oman was approximately 76,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Qatar In Qatar, Occidental is the operator at Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest.
797468_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The terms for ISND, ISSD and Block 12 expire in 2019, 2022 and 2017, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	In 2011, Occidental received approval from the Government of Qatar for the fourth phase of field development of the ISND Field, focusing on continued development of mature reservoirs while further delineating and developing less mature reservoirs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Occidental also received approval for field development plans for ISSD and Al Rayyan, which include additional drilling through 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Occidental's share of production from Qatar was approximately 114,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	United Arab Emirates In the first quarter of 2011, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the Al Hosn gas project, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The project is anticipated to produce over 500 MMcf per day of natural gas, of which Occidental s net share would be over 200 MMcf per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, the project is expected to produce over 50,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensates, of which Occidental s net share would be over 20,000 barrels per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Occidental s 2012 capital expenditures for this project were approximately $1.2 billion.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	A substantial portion of the total expenditures to date has been incurred in connection with plants and facilities and is included in the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	As the development progresses, higher portions of the capital expenditures will be spent to drill wells, which will be reflected in the oil and gas segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	Occidental believes that its share of total 2013 capital for the project will be approximately $1.1 billion.
797468_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Yemen In Yemen, Occidental owns interests in: Block 10 East Shabwa Field, which extends through 2015 with a 40.4-percent interest that includes an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, and Block S-1 An Nagyah Field, which is an Occidental-operated block with a 75-percent working interest that extends into 2023.
797468_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Occidental's share of production from the Yemen properties was approximately 14,000 BOE per day in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Bolivia Occidental holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Colombia Occidental has a working interest in the La Cira-Infantas area and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin.
797468_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Occidental's share of production was approximately 29,000 BOE per day in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGL and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	Oil, NGL and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	For the 2012 , 2011 and 2010 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $94.71, $96.19 and $79.43 per barrel, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 disclosures were $2.79, $4.04 and $4.39 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S4	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2012 of 3,296 million BOE, as compared with the year-end 2011 amount of 3,176 million BOE.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S5	Proved reserves at year-end 2012 and 2011 consisted of, respectively, 62 percent and 63 percent oil, 10 percent and 9 percent NGLs and 28 percent and 28 percent natural gas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P56_S6	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 73 percent and 76 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Proved Reserve Additions Occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 400 million BOE in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The total additions were as follows:
797468_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Many of these factors are outside of management s control, and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels.
797468_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2012 , Occidental added proved reserves of 257 million BOE from improved recovery through its EOR and infill drilling activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Generally, the improved recovery additions in 2012 were associated with the continued development of properties in California, Permian, South Texas and Oman.
797468_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of waterflood, steamflood or CO 2 injection, and unconventional projects.
797468_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	These types of conventional EOR development methods are often applied through existing wells, though additional drilling may be required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Steamflooding is the technique of injecting steam into the formation to lower oil viscosity so that it flows more freely into producing wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	This process is applied in areas where the oil is too viscous to be effectively moved with water.
797468_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	CO 2 flooding involves injecting CO 2 into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also obtained reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	recognition of initial proved undeveloped reserves from the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Purchases and Divestitures of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	In 2012 , Occidental added 94 million BOE through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in the Permian Basin, California, Williston Basin and South Texas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	For example, higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	Offsetting this effect, higher prices decrease Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because less oil is required to recover costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	Conversely, when prices drop, Occidental's share of proved reserves increases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P67_S5	In 2012 , revisions of previous estimates provided a net 183 million BOE reduction to proved reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	In 2012, revisions related to price for the company as a whole were negative.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	A substantial majority of such revisions related to Occidental's domestic gas reserves and resulted from lower domestic gas prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	These lower prices and the resulting changes in Occidental's plans for drilling on gas properties constituted a majority of its total revisions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	To the extent gas prices recover in the future, a portion of these reserves will be reinstated.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	If natural gas prices decrease further for an extended period, domestic gas reserves could experience additional negative price revisions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	Other negative revisions were mainly due to reservoir performances in Elk Hills and Midcontinent and Other.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S6	The revisions involved several properties where wells experienced higher-than-expected decline rates.
797468_13_ITEM7_P68_S7	Sizable portions of these revisions were transferred from the proved category to probable, possible and contingent categories.
797468_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	As a result, apart from the effect of product prices, it is generally more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive in aggregate over time rather than negative.
797468_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2012 , Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 443 million BOE from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases.
797468_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	improved recovery, primarily in California, Permian, South Texas and Oman.
797468_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Occidental added 46 million BOE through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in the Permian and Williston Basins and California.
797468_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Additionally, the proved undeveloped reserves increased due to extensions and discoveries mainly from the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 229 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2012 development programs and by revisions of 98 million BOE, which is included in total revisions discussed above.
797468_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	These revisions were in the same locations as those discussed above and factors that caused them were substantially the same as those that caused the changes to total proved reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Occidental incurred approximately $3.4 billion in 2012 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Permian, Bahrain, California, Oman and Williston accounted for approximately 86 percent of the reserves transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	Costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves have increased over time and may continue to increase.
797468_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Reserves Evaluation and Review Process Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2012 , were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserves volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.

797468_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	In 2012, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of Occidental s methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2012 , in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory standards.
797468_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2012 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	In 2012 , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 70 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes have fluctuated throughout 2012 , settling at $91.82 per barrel and $111.11 per barrel as of December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Oil prices will continue to be affected by (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments, (ii) currency exchange rates and (iii) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	These factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil prices reliably.
797468_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Occidental continues to adjust to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	The volatility in all of these markets makes it impossible to predict NGL prices reliably.
797468_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	These and other factors can cause prices to be volatile, making it impossible to predict domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment Chemical segment earnings decreased in 2012 , notably because margins were lower across most product lines as price and volume declines more than offset lower feedstock costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	While the overall United States economy experienced modest growth, the lower margins were primarily due to weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia, and increased competitive activity from these regions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2012 , United States manufacturing sectors experienced weak growth much of the year, resulting in soft domestic demand and pricing for basic chemical products.
797468_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Industry chlorine production decreased by approximately 2 percent, compared to 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	Chlorine prices decreased throughout the year due to lower chlorine demand caused by the slowdown of the Chinese economy and the European debt crisis.
797468_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain remained competitive in offshore markets as a result of the North America feedstock cost advantages, which are driven mostly by natural gas prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	soft because the markets anticipated increasing supply due to the improving United States economy.
797468_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Prices improved in the last two quarters of 2012 as a result of favorable global caustic soda supply and demand balances, resulting in prices finishing slightly above the prior year level.
797468_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Businesses such as calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide were also negatively impacted by a mild winter and drought conditions in the United States.
797468_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	During 2012, OxyChem began construction of a 182,500-ton-per-year membrane chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee, which it expects to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Vinyls Demand in the domestic housing and commercial construction markets increased, resulting in a year-over-year domestic vinyl demand increase of approximately 8 percent in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	The higher domestic demand combined with a modest growth in exports contributed to an approximately 4-percent industry-wide increase in domestic operating rates compared to 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Industry margins also increased in 2012 due to a combination of higher PVC selling prices and lower ethylene costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	Ethylene costs, which are a significant component of PVC feedstock costs, increased outside North America in 2012 due to the greater dependence on naphtha-based production versus ethane in the United States.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S4	North American-produced ethylene continues to be cost-competitive versus prices in Europe and Asia, giving North American vinyl products an advantage in global markets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P95_S5	Industry-wide North American exports of PVC accounted for greater than 35 percent of the total sales of North American producers.
797468_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Basic Chemicals Occidental expects that if the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve, domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	With improving demand, chlorine and caustic soda margins would be expected to remain at least at 2012 levels.
797468_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remaining favorable compared to other global markets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Vinyls North American demand and operating rates for vinyls should improve further in 2013 if growth of housing starts and commercial construction continues.
797468_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	Occidental expects export demand to remain firm and industry margins to improve as operating rates increase.
797468_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing, transportation and power generation assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market Occidental's and third-party volumes, trade oil, gas and other commodities and engage in storage activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	Earnings related to processing and transportation are affected by the volumes that are processed at, and transported through, the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012 were comparable to 2011 and reflected improved marketing and trading performance offset by lower gas processing margins.
797468_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Business Review Oil and Gas Marketing and Trading The marketing and trading group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and engages in commodities trading.
797468_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to improve marketing earnings.
797468_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	In addition, Occidental s Phibro trading unit's strategy is to profit from market price changes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	The marketing and trading group's earnings increased in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	Occidental s 2012 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2011 , which reflected lower NGL prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Occidental, together with ADNOC, is constructing a gas plant and facilities as part of the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi, which is expected to be operational in 2014.
797468_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Pipeline Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy.
797468_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 Bcf per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar.
797468_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,700 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 365,000 barrels per day, 5.8 million barrels of active storage capability and 85 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Occidental owns 35 percent of the general partner of Plains All-American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains Pipeline), a publicly traded oil and gas pipeline transportation, storage, terminalling and marketing entity in the western and southern United States and Canada.
797468_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	The Plains Pipeline contributed over 20 percent of the segment's earnings for 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Occidental and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. are proceeding with the construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline, which is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	The approximately 450-mile-long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil between the Permian region (Colorado City, TX) and the Gulf Coast refinery markets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	The BridgeTex Pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P111_S3	Occidental's 2012 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to higher volumes and pricing, and higher income from Plains Pipeline, partially offset by lower earnings from the Dolphin Pipeline.
797468_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and are generally not material.
797468_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGL prices, which cannot be predicted.
797468_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	Generally, higher NGL prices result in higher profitability.
797468_13_ITEM7_P113_S3	Based on its framework of controls and risk management systems, however, Occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole.
797468_13_ITEM7_P113_S4	Although the marketing and the trading businesses individually can cause volatility, the operations together tend to offset each other, significantly reducing the overall volatility of the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	(b) Oil and gas segment earnings, income from continuing operations and net income represent amounts attributable to common stock after deducting a noncontrolling interest amount of $72 million for 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	(c) The 2012 amount includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	The 2011 amount includes pre-tax charges of $35 million related to exploration write-offs in Libya and $29 million related to a Colombian net worth tax, and a pre-tax gain for the sale of an interest in a Colombian pipeline of $22 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S4	The 2010 amount includes a $275 million pre-tax charge for asset impairments, predominately of gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S5	(d) The 2011 amount includes a pre-tax charge of $163 million related to the premium on debt extinguishment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S6	(e) The 2011 amount includes a net $21 million charge for out-of-period state income taxes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S7	The 2010 amount includes an $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_13_ITEM7_P116_S8	(f) The 2011 amount includes a $144 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	(a) Includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	(a) For all periods presented, excludes volumes and amounts from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	(b) Includes production and sales volumes per day of 5 mbbl and 4 mbbl, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary.
797468_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	(c) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2012 were $7.1 billion compared to $10.2 billion in 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	The decrease reflected asset impairments and related items, lower NGL and natural gas prices, and higher depreciation depletion and amortization (DD A) rates, maintenance activity and field support costs and exploration expense, partially offset by higher oil prices and domestic volumes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	Average production costs for 2012, excluding taxes other than on income, were $14.99 per BOE, compared to $12.84 per BOE for 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S3	The increase reflected higher maintenance activities and field support costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S4	The fourth quarter of 2012 production costs were $14.95 per barrel, which was $1.04 per barrel lower than the third quarter of 2012 level.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S5	These reductions occurred during the course of the fourth quarter, and the 2012 year-end exit rate on a per barrel basis was lower than the fourth quarter 2011 average and well below the fourth quarter 2012 level.
797468_13_ITEM7_P120_S6	These reductions are expected to continue into 2013, reflecting planned improvements in operational efficiencies over many cost categories.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Average daily oil and gas production volumes were 766,000 BOE for 2012, compared to 733,000 BOE for 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	Occidental's domestic production increased by 9 percent, while total company production increased by 5 percent.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	Dolphin's full cost recovery of pre-startup capital, which reduced production, was the only operation where PSCs and similar contracts had an appreciable effect on 2012 production volumes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S3	Average daily sales volumes were 764,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2012, compared with 731,000 BOE for the same period in 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S4	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2011 were $10.2 billion compared to $7.2 billion in 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S5	The increase reflected higher oil and NGL prices and volumes, partially offset by higher DD A rates and higher operating costs, including higher field support, workover and well maintenance expenses driven by Occidental s program to increase production at current high oil prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S6	Average daily oil and gas production volumes were 733,000 BOE for 2011, compared with 711,000 BOE for 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S7	The increase was mainly due to acquisitions in South Texas, California and the Williston Basin and higher production in Oman s Mukhaizna Field and Iraq, which were partially offset by lower production in Libya.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S8	Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Colombia and Long Beach by higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting PSCs by 18,000 BOE per day.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S9	Average daily sales volumes were 731,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2011, compared with 705,000 BOE for 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P121_S10	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2012 included pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2011 included pre-tax charges of $35 million related to exploration write-offs in Libya and $29 million related to Colombia net worth tax, as well as a pre-tax gain for sale of an interest in a Colombian pipeline of $22 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $720 million in 2012, compared to $861 million in 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	The reduction was primarily the result of lower margins due to weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia and increased competitive activity from these regions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P123_S2	The calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide businesses were also negatively impacted by a mild winter and drought conditions in the United States.
797468_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $861 million in 2011, compared to $438 million in 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	The 2011 results reflected strong export sales and higher margins resulting from higher demand across most products.
797468_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	The increase in the chemical capital expenditures was mostly due to the new chlor-alkali plant.
797468_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012 were $439 million , compared to $448 million in 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The 2012 results reflected lower gas processing earnings and improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2011 were $448 million , compared to $472 million in 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P125_S3	The 2011 results reflected lower gas processing margins, partially offset by improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P125_S4	The increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
797468_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	(a) The 2011 amount includes a $144 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $2.0 billion, were $5.8 billion at December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $250 million is included in other current assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	Occidental s 2012 worldwide tax rate was 40 percent, slightly higher than 2011 and comparable to 2010 due to higher proportionate foreign pre-tax income in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	The 2011 income tax expense included a net $21 million charge for out-of-period state income taxes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P130_S2	The 2010 income tax expense included an $80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
797468_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, the additional deferred tax liability required would be immaterial, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of operations are discussed below:
797468_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	The increase in net sales in 2012 , compared to 2011 , was due to higher oil volumes and prices, partially offset by lower gas and NGL prices and lower prices and volumes across most chemical products.
797468_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	The increase in net sales in 2011 , compared to 2010 , was due to higher oil and NGL prices, higher oil and gas segment volumes and higher sales, including higher export sales, across most chemical products.
797468_13_ITEM7_P133_S2	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2012 , compared to 2011 , due to higher oil and gas volumes and operating costs, mostly resulting from higher maintenance activity and field support costs, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs in the chemical segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	Cost of sales increased in 2011 , compared to 2010 , due to higher oil and gas volumes, higher oil and gas operating costs, mostly resulting from higher workover and well maintenance activity and higher feedstock costs in the chemical segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2012 due to higher headcount, partially offset by lower equity compensation expense and the Colombia net worth tax which increased the 2011 costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2011 due to higher headcount and environmental remediation expense and the Colombia net worth tax.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S4	DD A increased in each year from 2010 to 2012 , generally due to higher DD A rates and volumes in the oil and gas segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P134_S5	The DD A rate is expected to further increase in 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Taxes other than on income increased in each year from 2010 to 2012 , due to higher domestic oil volumes and prices and higher domestic ad valorem taxes resulting from higher property values.
797468_13_ITEM7_P135_S1	Asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were over $6 per Mcf.
797468_13_ITEM7_P135_S2	Asset impairments and related items in 2010 predominately related to gas properties in the Rocky Mountain region.
797468_13_ITEM7_P135_S3	Interest and debt expense, net, in 2011 , included the $163 million early debt extinguishment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	Provision for income taxes decreased in 2012 , compared to 2011 , due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	The higher tax rate was due to higher proportional foreign pre-tax income in 2012, compared to 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	Provision for income taxes increased in 2011 , compared to 2010 , due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S3	The lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pre-tax income in 2011 , compared to 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S4	Income from equity investment in 2012 was comparable to 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S5	Income from equity investments increased in 2011 , compared to 2010 , due to an additional investment in the Plains Pipeline in late 2010 and its higher earnings.
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S6	Discontinued operations, net, in 2011 , included the $144 million after-tax gain recorded from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P136_S7	There was no net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2012 and 2011 due to the restructuring of Occidental s Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets as of December 31, 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents.
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	The decrease in trade receivables, net, was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2012, compared to the end of 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	The increase in inventories was primarily due to higher volumes of oil in storage and materials and supplies held at the end of 2012, compared to the end of 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S3	The increase in other current assets in 2012 resulted from an increase in tax receivables.
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S4	The decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was mostly due to higher distributions received in the current year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P138_S5	The increase in PP E, net, was due to capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, partially offset by DD A and asset impairments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity The increase in current maturities of long-term debt was due to debt maturing in 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	The decrease in accounts payable reflected lower oil and gas prices in the marketing and trading operations during the fourth quarter of 2012 and lower oil and gas spending levels at the end of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	The decrease in accrued liabilities was mostly due to the acceleration of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend payment, which normally would have been accrued as of year end but paid in the first quarter of the following year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	The increase in long-term debt, net, was due to the June 2012 issuance of $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes, partially offset by debt maturities that became current at the end of 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S4	The increase in deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes was mainly due to accelerated tax depreciation of the capital expenditures in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P139_S5	The increase in stockholders' equity reflected net income for 2012, partially offset by dividends and treasury stock purchases.
797468_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2012 , Occidental had approximately $1.6 billion in cash on hand, a substantial majority of which is held domestically.
797468_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices and sales volumes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P140_S2	Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2016.
797468_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_13_ITEM7_P141_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2012 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	Occidental has a shelf registration statement that facilitates future issuances of securities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	In June 2012, Occidental issued $1.75 billion of debt which comprised $1.25 billion of 2.70 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500 million of 1.50 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2018.
797468_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.74 billion .
797468_13_ITEM7_P146_S2	Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August for each series of notes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	Occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	Although net income decreased by $2.2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period of 2011, net cash provided by operating activities only decreased by $1.0 billion for this period.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	Compared to 2011, net income in 2012 included much larger non-cash charges, which reduced net income but not cash provided by operating activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	These non-cash charges mainly comprised asset impairments and higher DD A. Working capital changes in 2012 further reduced cash flow from operations by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S3	Additionally, operating cash flows in 2012, compared to 2011, reflected lower domestic gas and worldwide NGL prices, by 35 percent and 19 percent, respectively, and higher maintenance activity and field support costs, partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and 2-percent higher worldwide oil prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S4	The positive cash-flow impact of the oil price change was more than offset by the negative effect of significant declines in gas and NGL prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S5	The decrease in operating cash flows in 2012, compared to 2011, also reflected lower chemical margins, primarily due to weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S6	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_13_ITEM7_P148_S7	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the changes in oil prices and volumes and gas and NGL prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	The most important sources of the increase in operating cash flow in 2011, compared to 2010, were higher worldwide oil and NGL prices and volumes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	compared to 2010, Occidental s global realized oil and NGL prices increased 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	In 2011, Occidental s oil and NGL production accounted for 71 percent of its total net sales.
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S2	Increases in field support, workover and well maintenance costs in 2011, compared to 2010, partially offset the increases in prices and volumes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S3	The increase in operating cash flows in 2011, compared to 2010, also reflected high chemical product prices and margins for most products .
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S4	The impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments are significantly smaller.
797468_13_ITEM7_P150_S5	Other non-cash charges to income in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included charges for stock-based compensation plans and asset retirement obligation accruals.
797468_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Operating cash flows for discontinued operations include the Argentine operations through the date they were sold in February 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	The increase in capital expenditures of $2.7 billion from 2011 to 2012 was mainly due to the $2.1 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures, a majority of which was in domestic properties, such as Permian and California, as well as increases throughout the Middle East.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	Occidental s United States average operated-rig activity increased 25 percent from 51 rigs in 2011 to 64 rigs in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S2	The rig count was 41 at the end of 2012.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S3	The increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S4	Occidental s capital spending is expected to decrease in 2013 to approximately $9.6 billion and will be focused on increasing oil production and ensuring Occidental's returns remain well above its costs of capital given current prices and the cost environment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S5	The reduction in capital will come entirely from the oil and gas segment, almost all of which will be in Occidental's domestic operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P152_S6	Occidental expects that a meaningful portion of the capital reduction will come from efficiencies in its drilling program.
797468_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, Occidental embarked on an efficiency program that, among other things, targeted a 15-percent reduction in its drilling costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	Through the end of 2012 and early 2013, Occidental believes that it has already achieved about half of the targeted savings with further improvements expected during the remainder of 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	production while reducing capital expenditures because it expects much of the capital reduction to come from efficiencies and not reduced activity.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	It expects only a modest impact on natural gas and NGL production from reduced gas drilling.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	The midstream and marketing segment capital spending will increase mainly for the BridgeTex pipeline.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S3	The 2013 capital program is expected to be approximately 75 percent in oil and gas, 11 percent in the Al Hosn gas project, 9 percent in domestic midstream and marketing and the remainder in the chemical segment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S4	Occidental expects to spend about 25 percent of its total capital expenditures on projects that will begin contributing to its earnings and cash flow over the next several years.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S5	These projects include the Al Hosn gas project, the BridgeTex pipeline, expansion of gas and CO 2 processing plants and a new chlor-alkali plant in the chemical business.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S6	As of December 31, 2012, the accumulated balance of such project costs that will contribute to earnings in future years, excluding costs of undeveloped acreage, was approximately $3.1 billion.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S7	Occidental expects this balance to grow by the end of 2013 before these investments start generating returns in 2014.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S8	The 2012 other investing activities, net amount included $2.5 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin, the Williston Basin, California and South Texas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S9	Also included in 2012 investing activities was approximately $190 million of cash dividends received as investment returns.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S10	The increase in capital expenditures of $3.6 billion from 2010 to 2011 was mainly due to the $3.0 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures, which reflected Occidental s share of development costs in Oman and Bahrain, and higher spending in domestic properties in California, the Permian Basin, South Texas and the Williston Basin.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S11	Occidental s United States operated rig activity increased 89 percent from 38 rigs at year-end 2010 to 72 rigs at year-end 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S12	The 2011 other investing activities, net amount included $4.9 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, including various interests in domestic oil and gas properties, in operated, producing and non-producing properties in California and the Permian and Williston Basins for approximately $2.4 billion, properties in South Texas for $1.8 billion and $0.5 billion for Occidental s share of pre-acquisition development expenditures incurred by the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_13_ITEM7_P154_S13	The 2010 other investing activities, net amount included $4.9 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, including acquisitions of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties, in operated, producing and non-producing properties in the Permian Basin, Midcontinent region and California, for approximately $2.5 billion, properties in North Dakota for approximately $1.4 billion, additional interests in Plains Pipeline for approximately $430 million and the remaining 50-percent interest in EHP for approximately $175 million, as well as foreign contract payments of approximately $225 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	Investing cash flow from discontinued operations included $2.6 billion of cash received from the sale of the Argentine operations in 2011, and capital expenditures of $310 million in 2010.
797468_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	Commitments at December 31, 2012 , for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion , which will be due in 2013 and beyond.
797468_13_ITEM7_P155_S2	Occidental expects to fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	The 2012 net cash used by financing activities included net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the June 2012 issuance of senior unsecured notes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	Common stock dividends paid increased by $0.7 billion to $2.1 billion in 2012, which included the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend.
797468_13_ITEM7_P156_S2	In addition, purchases of treasury stock increased from $274 million in 2011 to $583 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P156_S3	The 2011 amount included net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the August 2011 issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing cash flow use of $1.5 billion to retire other long-term debt.
797468_13_ITEM7_P156_S4	Common stock dividends paid increased from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $1.4 billion in 2011.

797468_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Guarantees Occidental has guaranteed certain equity investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $370 million of Dolphin s debt, for which the fair value was immaterial.
797468_13_ITEM7_P158_S2	See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Qatar" and Segment Results of Operations for further information about Dolphin.
797468_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.

797468_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	Delivery Commitments Occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production.
797468_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	The total amount contracted to be delivered, a substantial majority of which is in the United States, is approximately 65 million barrels of oil through 2019, 73 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 3 million barrels of NGLs through 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
797468_13_ITEM7_P163_S3	Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and none of the commitments in any given year are material.
797468_13_ITEM7_P163_S4	In addition, Occidental has the ability to secure additional volumes in the case of a shortfall.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.

797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired assets with respect to which third parties retain liability or indemnify Occidental for conditions that existed prior to purchase.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S5	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S6	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_13_ITEM7_P164_S7	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.

797468_13_ITEM7_P165_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_13_ITEM7_P165_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P165_S3	Environmental matters are further discussed under the caption "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" below.
797468_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	On October 5, 2012, an Arbitral Tribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an agency of the World Bank, found that Ecuador violated the United States - Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2006 when it terminated Occidental s Block 15 concession.
797468_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to pay $1.77 billion, plus interest, in damages.
797468_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	Ecuador has filed an application asking ICSID to annul the damage award; it could take over a year for ICSID to rule on Ecuador s application for annulment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P166_S3	Pursuant to a 2000 Farmout Agreement, Andes Petroleum is entitled to 40% of any net amount which Occidental recovers from Ecuador in this ICSID proceeding.
797468_13_ITEM7_P166_S4	The effect, if any, on the financial statements will be recognized upon final resolution of this matter.
797468_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental's income taxes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_13_ITEM7_P171_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.
797468_13_ITEM7_P172_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P173_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 161 sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $ 10 million each at 12 of the 161 sites described above, and 112 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $ 1 million each.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , two landfills in western New York owned by Occidental accounted for 73 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , Maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 8 of the 75 third-party sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S4	Two of the remaining 67 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee and a containment and removal project in Tennessee accounted for 43 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S5	Five sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 70 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P176_S6	Three other sites former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 55 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $ 375 million .
797468_13_ITEM7_P178_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_13_ITEM7_P178_S3	Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P180_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $ 130 million for 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	At December 31, 2012 , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $12.3 billion , or approximately 19 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_13_ITEM7_P181_S2	Of such assets, approximately $10.6 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately $1.6 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_13_ITEM7_P181_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , net sales outside North America totaled $8.8 billion , or approximately 36 percent of total net sales.
797468_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P182_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_13_ITEM7_P182_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_13_ITEM7_P182_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_13_ITEM7_P182_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_13_ITEM7_P183_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_13_ITEM7_P185_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_13_ITEM7_P185_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_13_ITEM7_P186_S2	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_13_ITEM7_P186_S3	Occidental expenses the costs of injectants used in production.
797468_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_13_ITEM7_P189_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline.
797468_13_ITEM7_P189_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S3	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S4	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_13_ITEM7_P190_S5	In 2012 , revisions of previous estimates provided a net 183 million BOE reduction to proved reserves, which amounted to less than 6 percent of Occidental's total reserves as of December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	In 2012, revisions related to price for the company as a whole were negative.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	A substantial majority of such revisions related to Occidental's domestic gas reserves and resulted from lower domestic gas prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	These lower prices and the resulting changes in Occidental's plans for drilling on gas properties constituted a majority of its total revisions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S3	To the extent gas prices recover in the future, a portion of these reserves will be reinstated.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S4	If natural gas prices decrease further for an extended period, domestic gas reserves could experience additional negative price revisions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S5	The most significant financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves would be to the DD A rate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S6	For example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.80 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $225 million annually at current production rates.
797468_13_ITEM7_P191_S7	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	At December 31, 2012 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $4.8 billion.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_13_ITEM7_P192_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_13_ITEM7_P193_S2	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, when applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, impairment charges totaling $1.7 billion pre-tax were taken on certain proved and unproved properties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	Almost all of the charges were for certain properties in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were more than $6 per Mcf.
797468_13_ITEM7_P194_S2	These properties were impacted by persistently low natural gas prices in the United States changing management's development plans and negative reserve revisions due to recent well performance.
797468_13_ITEM7_P194_S3	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM7_P194_S4	Any further sustained declines in gas prices as well as significant sustained reductions in the prices of other products may result in additional impairments in the future.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	Chemical Assets Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_13_ITEM7_P195_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2013 is expected to be approximately $300 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P196_S3	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_13_ITEM7_P196_S4	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $45 million per year.
797468_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_13_ITEM7_P199_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions.
797468_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_13_ITEM7_P201_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_13_ITEM7_P203_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P205_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM7_P206_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P206_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_13_ITEM7_P207_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P207_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_13_ITEM7_P207_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_13_ITEM7_P207_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_13_ITEM7_P208_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_13_ITEM7_P208_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_13_ITEM7_P209_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_13_ITEM7_P209_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_13_ITEM7_P209_S2	Occidental generally classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_13_ITEM7_P210_S0	Embedded commodity derivatives Occidental values embedded commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_13_ITEM7_P210_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are observable and unobservable in the marketplace, and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_13_ITEM7_P211_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_13_ITEM7_P211_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S0	Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_13_ITEM7_P212_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_13_ITEM7_P213_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_13_ITEM7_P214_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_13_ITEM7_P214_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_13_ITEM7_P215_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_13_ITEM7_P215_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM7_P216_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_13_ITEM7_P216_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_13_ITEM7_P216_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_13_ITEM7_P216_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_13_ITEM7_P216_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_13_ITEM7_P217_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_13_ITEM7_P217_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $34 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P217_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $34 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S1	Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S4	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S5	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.
797468_13_ITEM7_P218_S6	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Other Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_13_ITEM7_P219_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES Listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P220_S0	Fair Value Measurements Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Occidental enhanced its fair value measurement application and disclosures as a result of adopting new requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in May 2011.
797468_13_ITEM7_P220_S1	The new rules include revisions to the standards for the use of fair value measurements and additional disclosures for: (i) all transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (ii) Level 3 measurements; and (iii) hierarchy classifications used for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the footnotes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P221_S0	The new rules did not have a material impact on Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S0	DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $150 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $115 million .
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to oil and gas prices also will change.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S5	The marketing and trading results are also sensitive to price changes of oil, gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S7	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S8	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P222_S9	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $25 million .
797468_13_ITEM7_P223_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_13_ITEM7_P224_S0	According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2012 average contract prices were: chlorine $255 per ton; caustic soda $635 per ton; and PVC $0.56 per lb.
797468_13_ITEM7_P225_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to establish, as of the date of production, the price it receives and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_13_ITEM7_P225_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_13_ITEM7_P226_S0	purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S0	Risk Manage me nt Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by certain members of management embedded in the marketing and trading operations in order to manage risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S2	These members of management report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S3	The President and Chief Executive Officer and risk committees comprising members of Occidental's senior corporate management also oversee these controls.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S4	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_13_ITEM7_P227_S5	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_13_ITEM7_P228_S0	Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts Occidental's marketing and trading derivative contracts are carried at fair value and result from third-party marketing and trading activities, sales of its production and activities to generate profits mainly from price changes in the commodities markets.
797468_13_ITEM7_P228_S1	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_13_ITEM7_P229_S0	Note : Includes cash-flow hedges further discussed below.
797468_13_ITEM7_P230_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental entered into financial swap agreements in November 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in California.
797468_13_ITEM7_P230_S1	These swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in January 2013 through March 2014 and qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_13_ITEM7_P230_S2	The weighted-average strike price of these swaps is $4.30.
797468_13_ITEM7_P231_S0	Through March 31, 2012, Occidental held financial swap agreements related to the sale of 50 million cubic feet per day of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualified as cash-flow hedges at a weighted-average strike price of $6.07 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P232_S0	weighted-average strike price that ranged from $32.92 to $46.35 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P233_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P233_S1	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 31, 2013.
797468_13_ITEM7_P234_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had approximately 20 billion cubic feet and 25 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P234_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 20 billion cubic feet and 35 billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P234_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , the total fair value of cash-flow hedges, which was a net asset of $9 million , was included in the total fair value table in "Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts" above.
797468_13_ITEM7_P235_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_13_ITEM7_P235_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95-percent level of confidence.
797468_13_ITEM7_P235_S2	Additionally, Occidental uses trading limits, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_13_ITEM7_P235_S3	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on it.
797468_13_ITEM7_P236_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P236_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_13_ITEM7_P237_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_13_ITEM7_P237_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_13_ITEM7_P238_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $31 million.
797468_13_ITEM7_P239_S0	Credit Risk Occidental's credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
797468_13_ITEM7_P240_S0	Occidental s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P240_S1	Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis, and master netting arrangements are used when appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P240_S2	Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure.
797468_13_ITEM7_P241_S0	A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_13_ITEM7_P241_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S4	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had a net liability of $34 million and $58 million , respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $64 million and $27 million , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S6	As of December 31, 2012 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties.
797468_13_ITEM7_P242_S7	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2012 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_13_ITEM7_P243_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_13_ITEM7_P243_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_13_ITEM7_P243_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_13_ITEM7_P243_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_13_ITEM7_P243_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_13_ITEM7_P244_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.

797468_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

797468_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of the oil and gas, chemical and midstream, marketing and other (midstream and marketing) segments.
797468_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	The segment also invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation.
797468_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	Management believes that these estimates and judgments provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 , and net sales of approximately $8.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability, nationalizations, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $1.0 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Inventories Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Oil, NGL and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_13_ITEM8_P31_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges.
797468_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_13_ITEM8_P34_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Occidental expenses the costs of injectants used in production.
797468_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)) are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	At December 31, 2012 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $4.8 billion .
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S4	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S5	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S6	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management's plans changed with respect to these properties, as a result of economic, operating or contractual conditions, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S7	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S8	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S9	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S10	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S11	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, when applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S12	Fluctuations in commodity prices and production and development costs could cause management's plans to change with respect to unproved properties and could cause the carrying values of proved properties to be unrealizable.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S13	Such circumstances could result in impairments in the carrying values of proved or unproved properties or both.
797468_13_ITEM8_P38_S14	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_13_ITEM8_P39_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_13_ITEM8_P43_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Embedded commodity derivatives Occidental values embedded commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are observable and unobservable in the marketplace, and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $385 million and $462 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_13_ITEM8_P49_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated.
797468_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P56_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1,212 million and $1,030 million is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality or grade of the physical commodity underlying the hedging instrument.
797468_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans follows.
797468_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock.
797468_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Compensation expense for RSUs and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of TSRIs and related dividends is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the number of shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria using the Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	In addition, every quarter, compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of RSUs and TSRIs is adjusted for changes in the value of the underlying stock.
797468_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	The stock-settled portion of all these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based payment transactions are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been included in the earnings allocations in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Pension and postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P75_S3	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.

797468_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	The 2011 interest paid included $154 million of debt extinguishment premiums.
797468_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign currency denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income.
797468_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.

797468_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	In November 2012, Occidental and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) formed BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC (BridgeTex) and are proceeding with the construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline, which is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The approximately 450 - mile-long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil between the Permian region (Colorado City, TX) and the Gulf Coast refinery markets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	The BridgeTex Pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Occidental owns a 50% interest in BridgeTex and the remaining 50% interest is owned by Magellan, which also serves as the operator.
797468_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	BridgeTex was determined to be a variable interest entity because of the difference between Occidental's economic interests and its decision-making rights.
797468_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	Occidental is the primary beneficiary and consequently consolidates BridgeTex.
797468_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	At December 31, 2012, BridgeTex held approximately $50 million of money market mutual funds, classified as cash equivalents, which approximates fair value using Level 1 inputs.

797468_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	In early 2011, Occidental ceased exploration activity and its participation in production operations in Libya due to civil unrest in the country and United States sanctions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	As a result, Occidental wrote off the entire amount of the capitalized and suspended exploration costs incurred to date, including lease acquisition costs, of approximately $35 million in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	The United States government lifted its sanctions in September 2011 and Occidental resumed its participation in the producing operations at that time.

797468_13_ITEM8_P87_S6	EHP is now consolidated in Occidental's balance sheet.
797468_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	In January 2010, Occidental and other consortium members signed a 20 -year contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field in Iraq.
797468_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Fair Value Measurements Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Occidental enhanced its fair value measurement application and disclosures as a result of adopting new requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in May 2011.
797468_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	The new rules include revisions to the standards for the use of fair value measurements and additional disclosures for: (i) all transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (ii) Level 3 measurements; and (iii) hierarchy classifications used for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the footnotes.
797468_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The new rules did not have a material impact on Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $185 million and $176 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.

797468_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2016.
797468_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_13_ITEM8_P93_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_13_ITEM8_P93_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2012 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.

797468_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $370 million and $300 million , respectively, of Dolphin s debt, of which the fair value was immaterial.
797468_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	At December 31, 2012 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated $7.6 billion , of which $0.6 billion is due in 2013 , $0.0 billion in 2014 , $0.0 billion in 2015 , $1.4 billion in 2016 , $1.2 billion in 2017 and $4.4 billion in 2018 and thereafter.
797468_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $8.2 billion and $6.4 billion , respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $7.6 billion and $5.9 billion , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require it to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense.
797468_13_ITEM8_P104_S2	At December 31, 2012 , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:
797468_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Rental expense for operating leases, net of sublease rental income for continuing operations, was $176 million in 2012 , $179 million in 2011 and $170 million in 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	Rental expense was net of sublease income of $4 million each in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to establish, as of the date of production, the price it receives and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and, when it does, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_13_ITEM8_P106_S2	Additionally, Occidental s Phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P106_S3	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental entered into financial swap agreements in November 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in California.
797468_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	These swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in January 2013 through March 2014 and qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_13_ITEM8_P107_S2	The weighted-average strike price of these swaps was $4.30.
797468_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	Through March 31, 2012, Occidental held financial swap agreements related to the sale of 50 million cubic feet per day of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualified as cash-flow hedges at a weighted-average strike price of $6.07 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Through December 31, 2011 , Occidental held a series of collar agreements for 12,000 barrels of oil per day of its domestic production that qualified as cash-flow hedges at a weighted-average strike price that ranged from $32.92 to $46.35 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P109_S1	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 31, 2013 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had approximately 20 billion cubic feet and 25 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 20 billion cubic feet and 35 billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	The following table presents the pre-tax and after-tax gains and losses recognized in, and reclassified to income from, AOCI, for derivative instruments classified as cash-flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):
797468_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	Occidental expects that during the next twelve months an insignificant amount of net after-tax derivative losses included in AOCI based on their valuation as of December 31, 2012 , will be reclassified into income.
797468_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	The gains and losses reclassified to income were recognized in net sales, and the amount of the ineffective portion of cash-flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following table summarizes Occidental's net volumes resulting from outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative contracts as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
797468_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	In addition, Occidental typically has certain other commodity trading contracts, such as agricultural products, power and other metals, as well as foreign exchange contracts.
797468_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	These contracts were not material to Occidental as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	Occidental fulfills its short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.
797468_13_ITEM8_P114_S1	Subsequent to December 31, 2012, Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial portion of the outstanding positions at year-end and has sufficient production capacity and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P114_S2	Approximately $49 million and $94 million of net gains from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the consolidated balance sheet.
797468_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	(b) As of December 31, 2012 , collateral received of $25 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $95 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P115_S2	(c) As of December 31, 2011 , collateral received of $42 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $66 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	See Note 15 for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives.
797468_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Credit Risk A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_13_ITEM8_P117_S1	Collateral of $116 million and $173 million deposited by Occidental for such contracts , which has not been reflected in the derivative fair value tables, is included in the other current assets balance as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P117_S2	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S4	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had a net liability of $34 million and $58 million , respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $64 million and $27 million , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P118_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_13_ITEM8_P119_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_13_ITEM8_P119_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P121_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 161 sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ( $80 million in 2012 , $79 million in 2011 and $79 million in 2010 ) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ( $264 million in 2012 , $281 million in 2011 and $287 million in 2010 ).
797468_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 12 of the 161 sites described above, and 112 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , two landfills in western New York owned by Occidental accounted for 73 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , Maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified Occidental for 8 of the 75 third-party sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P125_S1	Two of the remaining 67 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee and a containment and removal project in Tennessee accounted for 43 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P125_S2	Five sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 70 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P125_S3	Three other sites former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 55 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $375 million .
797468_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating properties.
797468_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	O PC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired assets with respect to which third-parties retain liability or indemnify Occidental for conditions that existed prior to purchase.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S5	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_13_ITEM8_P131_S6	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_13_ITEM8_P132_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_13_ITEM8_P133_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	At December 31, 2012 , total purchase obligations were $8.7 billion , which included approximately $2.7 billion , $1.4 billion , $700 million , $500 million and $400 million that will be paid in 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P136_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2013 and thereafter, which were approximately $2.2 billion .
797468_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_13_ITEM8_P137_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes and net of noncontrolling interest amounts were as follows:
797468_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	(a) Includes pre-tax charges of $1.8 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
797468_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	Included in total deferred tax assets was a current portion aggregating $250 million and $200 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, that was reported in other current assets.
797468_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P143_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	Occidental had, as of December 31, 2012 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.3 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2022, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	Substantially all of Occidental's valuation allowance is provided for foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S2	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $8.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S3	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $116 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S4	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $7 million and $86 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and income tax benefits of $26 million in 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S5	Additional paid-in capital was credited $8 million in 2012 , $14 million in 2011 and $22 million in 2010 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_13_ITEM8_P144_S6	As of December 31, 2012 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $76 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next twelve months by a material amount.
797468_13_ITEM8_P147_S3	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:
797468_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	TREASURY STOCK Occidental has had a 95 million share repurchase program authorized since 2008; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	In 2012 and 2011 , respectively, Occidental purchased 7.2 million and 2.7 million shares under the program at an average cost of $77.98 and $77.12 per share.
797468_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P149_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , treasury stock shares numbered 83.3 million, 75.8 million and 72.5 million, respectiv ely.
797468_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.
797468_13_ITEM8_P150_S1	At December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.
797468_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	(a) Includes after-tax charges of $1.1 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax gains (losses):
797468_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	(a) See Note 13 for further information.
797468_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	Occidental has established several Plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and TSRIs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P155_S1	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 15 million shares had been issued through December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P155_S2	Of the remaining shares, approximately 19 million shares are available for grants of future awards because a plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that otherwise would have been available for future awards.
797468_13_ITEM8_P155_S3	Further, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 19 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_13_ITEM8_P155_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or cancelled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	During 2012 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 53,800 shares of restricted stock that fully vested on the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_13_ITEM8_P156_S2	The following table summarizes certain stock-based incentive amounts for the past three years:
797468_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	(a) Includes cash paid under the cash-settled portion of the SARs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	(b) As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards, based on year-end valuation, was $196 million .
797468_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	RSUs Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria, and are, or are equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock and are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	These awards vest at the end of, or ratably over, two or three years from the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied between the third and seventh anniversaries after the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S2	For those awards that cliff vest in two years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting period and are paid when they vest.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S3	For the remaining RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S4	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were $84.38 , $104.74 and $77.14 per share, respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P159_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 were $84.81 , $102.97 and $84.29 respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2012 is presented below:
797468_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Options that are settled in stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
797468_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	No Options or SARs have been granted since 2006 and all outstanding awards are vested.
797468_13_ITEM8_P161_S2	Exercise prices of the Options and SARs were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P161_S3	Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years from the grant date with a maximum term of ten years.
797468_13_ITEM8_P161_S4	These Options and SARs may be forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.
797468_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	The fair value of each Option, stock-settled SAR or cash-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted-average life of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P162_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2012 :
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	TSRIs Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of the three- or four-year period following the grant date if performance targets are certified as being met.
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S1	TSRIs granted in July 2012 have payouts that range from 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award that would settle, once certified, fully in stock.
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S2	TSRIs granted in July 2011 and October 2010 have payouts that range from 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award that would settle, once certified, 50 percent in stock and 50 percent in cash.
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S3	TSRIs granted in July 2009 have payouts that ranged from 0 to 200 percent of the target award that would settle, once certified, 60 percent in stock and 40 percent in cash.
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S4	TSRIs granted in July 2008 had payouts of 150 percent of the target award and were certified and settled equally in stock and cash in 2012.
797468_13_ITEM8_P166_S5	Dividend equivalents for TSRI target shares are paid during the performance period regardless of the payout range or settlement provision, except for the TSRIs issued in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , for which cumulative dividends will be paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_13_ITEM8_P169_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_13_ITEM8_P169_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:
797468_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	A summary of Occidental s unvested TSRIs as of December 31, 2012 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2012 is presented below:
797468_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	(a) Unvested awards and award grants are presented at the target or mid-point payouts.
797468_13_ITEM8_P172_S1	(b) The payout at vesting was 150 percent of the target for TSRIs.
797468_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, age, level and employee contributions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P174_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_13_ITEM8_P174_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $145 million and $126 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $137 million in 2012 , $110 million in 2011 and $101 million in 2010 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 1,000 domestic and 1,600 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $218 million in 2012 , $194 million in 2011 and $180 million in 2010 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values (in millions):
797468_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans (in millions):
797468_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2013 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs (in millions):
797468_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $17 million and $0 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $37 million and $1 million , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2012 and 2011.
797468_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	The weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental s past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S1	Occidental considers historical returns and correlation of equities and fixed-income securities and current market factors such as inflation and interest rates.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S2	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S3	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 10.0 percent at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S4	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.5 percent to 10.0 percent in 2012 , depending on local economic conditions.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S5	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 6.5 percent and 5.8 percent in excess of local inflation in 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S6	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 2.39 percent and 2.04 percent as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S7	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S8	For those union employees, Occidental projected that healthcare cost trend rates would decrease 0.5 percent per year from 8.5 percent in 2012 until they reach 6.0 percent in 2017, and remain at 6.0 percent thereafter.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S9	A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed healthcare cost trend rates would result in an increase of $44 million or a reduction of $37 million , respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 .
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S10	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_13_ITEM8_P185_S11	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.

797468_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 10, 2013 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2012.
797468_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of California, Colorado, Kansas, and Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in certain production sharing contracts for certain properties located in the Middle East.
797468_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2012.
797468_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on an equivalent barrel (BOE) basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.
797468_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and over the recent past.
797468_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, and (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_13_ITEM15_P77_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_13_ITEM15_P79_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2012; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2012 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_13_ITEM15_P85_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	Approximately 43 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	The remaining 57 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.
797468_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	Approximately 15 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.
797468_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	The remaining 85 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Of the properties reviewed, approximately 26 percent of the proved producing reserves and 38 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques.
797468_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO 2 injection and infill drilling.
797468_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2012 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s average realized prices.
797468_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
797468_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	A summary of average realized prices are not included for certain properties located in the Middle East because of the host government s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
797468_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
797468_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_13_ITEM15_P96_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_13_ITEM15_P99_S4	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2012.
797468_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P101_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_13_ITEM15_P102_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_13_ITEM15_P102_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P103_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_13_ITEM15_P103_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S4	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S5	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_13_ITEM15_P105_S6	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_13_ITEM15_P107_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves, forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_13_ITEM15_P110_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_13_ITEM15_P110_S3	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2012.
797468_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

797468_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
797468_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
797468_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
797468_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
797468_13_ITEM15_P129_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
797468_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_13_ITEM15_P130_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_13_ITEM15_P130_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_13_ITEM15_P130_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
797468_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
797468_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
797468_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
797468_13_ITEM15_P133_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
797468_13_ITEM15_P133_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
797468_13_ITEM15_P133_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
797468_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
797468_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
797468_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
797468_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
797468_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
797468_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
797468_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
797468_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
797468_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
797468_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
797468_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
797468_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
797468_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
797468_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
797468_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
797468_13_ITEM15_P150_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
797468_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
797468_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
797468_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
797468_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
797468_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
797468_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
797468_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
797468_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
797468_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
797468_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_13_ITEM15_P162_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
797468_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
797468_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(2)] , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Changes in consumption patterns, global and local (particularly for gas) economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, technological developments, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil, gas and NGLs, which, along with the effect of changes in market perceptions, contribute to price unpredictability and volatility.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Occidental's potential restructuring activities may affect its stock price.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Occidental has disclosed that it is performing a strategic review of its operations, which may result in a restructuring of its business activities.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The outcome of this activity may affect the market value of Occidental's common stock.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	actions than expected, receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additionally, the restructuring activity may be viewed negatively by the market and result in a stock price drop.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Occidental bears the risks of equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Occidental may experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Occidental s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Concerns about climate change may affect Occidental s operations.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The U.S. federal government and the state of California have adopted, and other jurisdictions are considering, legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, California s GHG cap-and-trade program currently applies to Occidental's operations in the state.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate certain GHG emissions from both stationary and mobile sources.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international, national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	However, Occidental could face risks of project execution, increased costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions or prohibition on the use of its products as a result of ongoing GHG reduction efforts.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The occurrence of events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed, may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Cyber attacks could significantly affect Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If, however, Occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed, the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and its measure of full cycle cash margin may not be fully comparable to that of other companies.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Occidental uses a measure referred to as full cycle cash margin to measure its performance in developing reserves at a profitable cost.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The measure may not include all the costs associated with exploration and development related to reserves added for the period, or may include costs related to reserves added or to be added in other periods, and may differ from the calculations used by other companies.
797468_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Occidental has no unresolved SEC staff comments that have been outstanding more than 180 days at December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	event, the financial impact is expected to be insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_14_ITEM4_P0_S0	The current term of employment of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 2, 2014, organizational meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_14_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 30,000 stockholders of record at December 31, 2013 , and by approximately 648,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	The quarterly dividends declared on the common stock were $0.64 for each quarter of 2013 ($2.56 for the year).
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S4	On February 13, 2014 , a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2014 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2014 .
797468_14_ITEM5_P0_S5	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS All of Occidental's stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans is approximately 66 million , of which approximately 16 million had been issued through December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	(1) Includes shares reserved to be issued pursuant to stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and performance-based awards.
797468_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	Shares for performance-based awards are included assuming maximum payout, but may be paid out at lesser amounts, or not at all, according to achievement of performance goals.
797468_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	(2) Price applies only to the Options and SARs included in column (a).
797468_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	Exercise price is not applicable to the other awards included in column (a).
797468_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	(3) A plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_14_ITEM5_P3_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than the amount shown depending on the type of award granted.
797468_14_ITEM5_P3_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the amount shown may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	(a) Includes purchases from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	(b) Represents the number of shares remaining at year-end under Occidental's share repurchase program of 95 million.
797468_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	In February 2014, Occidental increased the number of shares authorized for its program by 30 million; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s current and prior peer groups over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500 and (iii) each of the current and prior peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the respective peer groups, and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_14_ITEM5_P6_S2	In 2013, Occidental revised its peer group (which includes Occidental) to ensure the companies continue to provide appropriate comparability to Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM5_P6_S3	Prior to the revision, Occidental's peer group consisted of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Total S.A. and Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM5_P6_S4	Occidental's current peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Total S.A. and Occidental.

797468_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end total shares of common stock outstanding, net of shares held as treasury stock, by the year-end closing stock price.
797468_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	(c) The 2012 amount includes an accelerated fourth quarter dividend payment, which normally would have been accrued as of year-end 2012 and paid in the first quarter of 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments operated by OPC's subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	STRATEGY General Through its operations, Occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet.
797468_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	To maximize returns, Occidental from time to time reviews its business strategy.
797468_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	In October 2013 and February 2014, Occidental s Board of Directors authorized several actions resulting from a strategic review to streamline and focus operations in order to better execute Occidental s long-term strategy and enhance value for shareholders.
797468_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Pursue the sale of a minority interest in the Middle East/North Africa operations in a financially efficient manner.
797468_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Pursue strategic alternatives for select Midcontinent assets, including oil and gas interests in the Williston Basin, Hugoton Field, Piceance Basin and other Rocky Mountain assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Pursue the sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in the General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains Pipeline).
797468_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Separation of its California assets into an independent and separately traded company.
797468_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	With respect to these initiatives, since October, Occidental:
797468_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Entered into an agreement to sell its Hugoton operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The strategic review underway is expected to result in significant changes to Occidental s asset mix.
797468_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Occidental's capital program, production expectations and other elements of its future plans will be adjusted as related transactions are concluded.
797468_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Proceeds resulting from these actions will largely be used to reduce Occidental's capitalization.
797468_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Occidental also retired $0.6 billion of its debt in the fourth quarter.
797468_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Occidental prioritizes the use of its operating cash flows in the following order:
797468_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Acquisitions Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Management aims to develop Occidental's assets in a manner that would contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital.
797468_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	The following describes the application of Occidental's overall strategy to each of its operating segments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Occidental prefers to hold large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective production.
797468_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Occidental also focuses a growing portion of its drilling activities on unconventional shale opportunities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The oil and gas business seeks to increase its oil and gas production profitably and add new reserves at a pace ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development of such reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by:
797468_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures with an emphasis on transactions at attractive prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Over the past several years, Occidental built a large portfolio of growth-oriented assets in the United States.
797468_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	In 2013, Occidental spent a much larger portion of its investment capital on the development of this portfolio.
797468_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Acquisitions in 2013 were at a multi-year low of approximately $0.5 billion, all for domestic oil and gas properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Compared to recent years, this reduced acquisition activity reflects Occidental's strategy to capitalize on the opportunities presented by its existing portfolio of assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	Management currently believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will come domestically from higher oil production in California and the Permian Basin, and internationally from opportunities in key assets, mainly in Oman and Qatar, as well as the completion of the Al Hosn gas project in late 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The primary objective of the chemical business (OxyChem) is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC.
797468_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	OxyChem expects to begin operating the New Johnsonville, Tennessee chlor-alkali facility in early 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, Occidental sold its investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian joint venture, for a pre-tax gain of $131 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V. formed a 50/50 joint venture to construct and operate a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker with startup expected in 2017, and entered into related supply agreements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	In order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other Occidental segments as well as third parties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	In commodities trading, Occidental seeks to generate gains using net-long positions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The segment invests in and operates gas plants, co-generation facilities, pipeline systems and storage facilities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses and to limit credit risk exposure.
797468_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Occidental and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) are proceeding with the construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline, which will transport crude oil between the Permian region and the Gulf Coast refinery markets and is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	In 2013, Occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in Plains Pipeline, resulting in a $1.0 billion pre-tax gain.
797468_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Occidental also monitors other segment-specific indicators such as per-unit profit, production costs and finding and development costs, as well as health, environmental and safety measures such as the number of recordable injuries, and others.
797468_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Based on the $2.88 per share annual dividend rate announced in February 2014 , Occidental s dividend rate has increased by 476 percent since 2002.
797468_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	While its stockholders' equity increased by 8 percent for 2013 and 34 percent for the three-year period from 2011 through 2013 , Occidental continued to deliver above-cost-of-capital returns as follows:
797468_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The top figures were calculated by dividing Occidental's 2013 net income (adding back after-tax interest expense for ROCE) by its average equity (using debt and equity for ROCE) during 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The bottom figures were calculated in the same manner as the top figures, except that they exclude the effects of Significant Items Affecting Earnings described on page 25.
797468_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	We provide this adjusted measure because we believe it would be useful to investors in evaluating and comparing Occidental's performance between periods, not as a substitute for the measure calculated using net income.
797468_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	(b) The three-year averages were calculated by dividing Occidental's average net income (adding back after-tax interest expense for ROCE) over the three-year period by its average equity (using debt and equity for ROCE) over the same period.
797468_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	(a) Amounts were calculated by subtracting operating costs, taxes other than on income and general and administrative expenses for producing operations, all on a per BOE basis, from realized price for the year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Subtracted from this amount is the finding and development costs per BOE, calculated by dividing exploration and development costs incurred, including asset retirement obligations, but excluding acquisition costs, by proved reserve additions for the year from improved recovery, extensions, discoveries and revisions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Reserve additions include proved undeveloped reserves, for which estimated future development costs are included in amounts disclosed in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows.
797468_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	ratio from 16 percent at year-end 2012 to 14 percent at year-end 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short- and intermediate-term financial performance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2013 and 2012 :
797468_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2013 and 2012 :
797468_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Average worldwide realized oil prices were flat in 2013 compared to 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Approximately 60 percent of Occidental s oil production tracks world oil prices, such as Brent, and 40 percent tracks WTI.
797468_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2013 increased 29 percent from 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Operations Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.
797468_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Of the total 8.2 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 74 percent is leased, 25 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Production-Sharing Contracts (PSC) Occidental has interests that are operated under PSCs or similar contracts in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar and Yemen.
797468_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following chart shows Occidental s total volumes for the last five years:
797468_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Permian Basin Occidental's Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 15 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 15 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the basin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian EOR (enhanced oil recovery), which includes CO 2 and waterfloods, and Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	During 2013, capital efficiency efforts reduced drilling costs per well by 25 percent for the Permian Basin operations while operating expenses decreased by $3.22 per barrel, or 17 percent.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition, management began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program to take advantage of unconventional and shale opportunities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	In the Permian Basin, Occidental spent over $1.7 billion of capital in 2013 with 64 percent spent on Permian Resources assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	In 2014, Permian Basin capital spending is expected to be slightly less than $2.2 billion.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	The entire $450 million increase will be spent on Permian Resources assets and will focus on growing oil production.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	Approximately 70 percent of the total capital to be spent in the Permian Basin will be for Permian Resources assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	Occidental's Permian Resources operations are among its fastest-growing assets and held approximately 1.9 million net acres at the end of 2013, including acreage with prospective resource potential.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S8	The development program, largely begun in 2010, continued to increase in 2013, accounting for more than 285 wells drilled.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S9	In 2013, Permian Resources drilled 49 horizontal wells and expects this to increase in 2014 to approximately 172 of its 345 total planned wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S10	Production from this business unit comes from approximately 9,500 gross wells, of which 54 percent are operated by other producers.
797468_14_ITEM7_P45_S11	On a net basis, this represents approximately 4,400 wells, of which only 15 percent are operated by others.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Permian EOR business unit operates a combination of CO 2 and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Approximately 74 percent of Occidental s Permian EOR oil production is from fields that actively employ CO 2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	These CO 2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	Occidental believes it has the ability to accelerate growth in the Permian EOR projects as more CO 2 becomes available.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	Over the past several years, Occidental has focused more capital on waterfloods than CO 2 developments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P46_S5	Of the $660 million in capital spending Permian EOR plans for 2014, 25 percent will be used for current waterflood development and the remainder for CO2 floods.
797468_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Occidental's share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 212,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	California Occidental's California operations include interests in the San Joaquin Valley, the Wilmington and other fields in the Los Angeles Basin, and the Ventura and Sacramento Basins.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	and has properties in approximately 130 fields.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Occidental manages its California operations through separate teams focused on waterfloods; steam floods for heavy oil resources; and unconventional and other developing plays.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	The main California objectives in 2013 were to deliver a predictable outcome, advance low-risk projects that contribute to long-term growth, reduce the cost structure, lower the base decline, create a more balanced portfolio and test exploration and development concepts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Occidental believes it achieved all of these objectives in 2013, notably progressing the development of its multi-year steam floods in Kern Front and Lost Hills, bringing its Huntington Beach Field waterflood redevelopment online, further developing its Wilmington Field, improving capital efficiency by 20 percent and reducing operating costs by $4.70 per BOE, or 20 percent.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	Occidental increased the 2013 oil development capital spending to almost 90 percent of the total capital for California.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	Of the $1.5 billion of capital spent in 2013, 39 percent was for waterfloods, 22 percent for steam floods and 39 percent for unconventional and other developing plays.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S6	The 2014 program will continue efforts in each of these areas with increased efforts in horizontal wells in Occidental's waterfloods, new pilot projects in its steam floods and increased unconventional drilling.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S7	The allocation for the $1.9 billion 2014 capital program is expected to be similar to 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P49_S8	The 2014 capital strategy is to continue focusing the majority of capital spending on projects identified as low-decline, low-risk, and high-return that are expected to provide long-term growth and capitalize on recent exploration successes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Occidental drilled approximately 770 wells in California during 2013 and plans to drill approximately 1,050 wells in 2014, including 175 waterflood wells in the LA Basin, 420 wells for steam floods and 130 unconventional shale wells at Elk Hills.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Over the next several years, there will be some rebalancing between high-decline, such as Elk Hills, and low-decline assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	With the higher investments in water and steam floods, production from these fields is expected to grow faster.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	The investments being made in high-decline assets are expected to moderate their decline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	As a result, the balance of assets in the California portfolio is expected to shift towards low-decline assets over time.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S5	In addition, Occidental holds more than 2.3 million net acres in California, the large majority of which are net fee mineral interests.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S6	As a result, Occidental has a substantial inventory of properties available for future development and exploitation opportunities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S7	Currently, approximately one-third of California production is from unconventional reservoirs and Occidental holds more than 1.1 million net acres for such resources.
797468_14_ITEM7_P50_S8	Occidental's share of production in California was approximately 154,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Midcontinent and Other The Midcontinent and Other properties include interests in the Hugoton Field, the Piceance Basin, the Williston Basin, and the Eagle Ford Shale and other areas in South Texas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota and Texas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Occidental holds over 2.3 million net acres in the Midcontinent region, which includes 1.4 million net acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the Hugoton area and approximately 168,000 net acres in the Piceance area.
797468_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Occidental also holds approximately 176,000 net acres in South Texas, including 4,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale.
797468_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, Occidental holds approximately 335,000 net acres of oil-producing and unconventional properties in the Williston Basin's Bakken, Three Forks and Pronghorn formations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	In Midcontinent and Other, Occidental drilled approximately 175 wells and produced approximately 108,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other Developments During its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2013, management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices, availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $0.6 billion for the acreage.
797468_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Bahrain In 2009, Occidental and other consortium members began operating the Bahrain Field under a 20-year development and production sharing agreement (DPSA).
797468_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Occidental has a 48-percent working interest in the joint venture.
797468_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	Since handover of operations, the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity more than 50 percent from an initial level of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26,000 barrels per day to 44,000 barrels per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	Occidental's share of production from Bahrain during 2013 was approximately 241 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of gas and 3,000 barrels of oil per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Iraq In 2010, Occidental and other consortium members signed a 20-year contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field.
797468_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	In 2013, the terms were improved reflecting a reduction in the targeted production level to 850,000 BOE per day and a five-year extension to 2035.
797468_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Occidental's interest in this contract entitles Occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee.
797468_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Past delays in development plans have limited the amount of production from Iraq.
797468_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Occidental does not know when development activities will reach desired levels.
797468_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occidental's share of production from Iraq was approximately 17,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Libya Occidental participates with the Libyan National Oil Company in the Sirte Basin producing operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	In 2013, production was disrupted for a significant portion of the year due to field and port strikes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Occidental does not know when operations will return to normal levels.
797468_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	The 2013 production volume was approximately 7,000 BOE per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Oman In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each block; Block 53, with a 45-percent working interest; and Block 62, with a 48-percent working interest.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	A 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) was signed with the Government of Oman in 2005, pursuant to which Occidental assumed operation of the field.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	By the end of 2013 , Occidental had drilled more than 2,100 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	In 2013 , the average gross daily production was 123,000 BOE per day, which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in September 2005 when Occidental assumed operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	The term for Block 9 continues through December 2015, with a 10-year extension right for certain areas, subject to government approval.
797468_14_ITEM7_P59_S5	The term for Block 27 expires in 2035.
797468_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2008, Occidental was awarded a 20-year contract for Block 62, subject to declaration of commerciality, where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources.
797468_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Occidental's share of production from Oman was approximately 74,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Qatar In Qatar, Occidental is the operator at Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest.
797468_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The terms for ISND, ISSD and Block 12 expire in 2019, 2022 and 2017, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2013, Occidental received approval from the Government of Qatar for the fifth phase of field development of the ISND Field, intended to improve the ultimate recovery in all existing contract reservoirs by drilling over 200 additional production, water injection and water source wells and installing associated facilities required to support the additional wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Occidental's aggregate investment is expected to exceed $3 billion through 2019 with the goal of sustaining gross oil production levels at approximately 100,000 barrels per day during that period.
797468_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	Occidental's share of production from Qatar was approximately 105,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	United Arab Emirates In 2011, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the Al Hosn gas project, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Once fully operational, the project is anticipated to produce over 500 MMcf per day of natural gas, of which Occidental s net share would be over 200 MMcf per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	In addition, the project is expected to produce over 50,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate, of which Occidental s net share would be over 20,000 barrels per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	Occidental s 2013 capital expenditures for this project were approximately $950 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S4	A substantial portion of the total expenditures to date has been incurred in connection with plants and facilities and is included in the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S5	Occidental believes that its share of total 2014 capital for the project will be approximately $760 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P63_S6	Initial production from this project is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Yemen In Yemen, Occidental owns interests in: Block 10 East Shabwa Field, which extends through 2015 with a 40.4-percent interest that includes an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, and Block S-1 An Nagyah Field, which is an Occidental-operated block with a 75-percent working interest that extends into 2023.
797468_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Occidental's share of production from the Yemen properties was approximately 12,000 BOE per day in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Bolivia Occidental holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Colombia Occidental has a working interest in the La Cira-Infantas area and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	Occidental's share of production was approximately 29,000 BOE per day in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGL and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Oil, NGL and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	For the 2013 , 2012 and 2011 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $96.94, $94.71 and $96.19 per barrel, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 disclosures were $3.65, $2.79 and $4.04 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2013 of 3,483 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2012 amount of 3,296 million BOE.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	Proved reserves at year-end 2013 and 2012 consisted of, respectively, 62 percent oil each year, 12 percent and 10 percent NGLs and 26 percent and 28 percent natural gas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P68_S6	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 70 percent and 73 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter.
797468_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Proved Reserve Additions Occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 470 million BOE in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Over 90 percent of these reserve additions were the result of Occidental's development program.
797468_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	The total additions were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Many of these factors are outside management s control, and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels.
797468_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Occidental's 2013 development program provided approximately 291 million BOE of reserve additions domestically.
797468_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2013 , Occidental added proved reserves of 348 million BOE from improved recovery through its EOR and infill drilling activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Generally, the improved recovery additions in 2013 were associated with the continued development of properties in Permian Basin, California, Williston Basin, Qatar and Oman.
797468_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO 2 , waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects.
797468_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The use of either CO 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO 2 or steam and other economic factors.
797468_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	In 2013 , extensions and discoveries added 81 million BOE, substantially all of which is attributable to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves from the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Purchases of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	In 2013 , Occidental added 37 million BOE through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in the Permian Basin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	For example, higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Offsetting this effect, higher prices decrease Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because less oil is required to recover costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	Conversely, when prices drop, Occidental's share of proved reserves increases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P81_S5	In 2013 , revisions of previous estimates provided an increase of 4 million BOE to proved reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	As a result, apart from the effect of product prices, it is generally more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive in aggregate over time rather than negative.
797468_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2013 , Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 363 million BOE from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases.
797468_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Of the total additions, 270 million BOE represented additions from improved recovery, primarily in Permian Basin, California, Williston Basin and internationally in Qatar and Oman.
797468_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Occidental added 15 million BOE through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in the Permian Basin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	Additionally, the proved undeveloped reserves increased due to extensions and discoveries mainly from the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 150 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2013 development programs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	approximately $2.7 billion in 2013 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Permian Basin, California, Oman, Williston Basin and South Texas accounted for approximately 88 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	While costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves have generally increased over time, in 2013 domestic development costs per barrel decreased by 25 percent as a result of the capital efficiency initiatives.
797468_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	A substantial portion of the PUDs as of December 31, 2013, as well as the increase in the share of PUDs in 2013, compared to 2012, was the result of PUDs from the Al Hosn gas project reserves, which represented 27 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter.
797468_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Reserves Evaluation and Review Process Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2013 , were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.

797468_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The Senior Vice President has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe.
797468_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.
797468_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Classification.
797468_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	He is also an active member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training (JCORET).
797468_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	In 2013, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2013 , in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards.
797468_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2013 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	In 2013 , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 21 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 71 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes fluctuated throughout 2013 , settling at $98.42 per barrel and $110.80 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Oil prices will continue to be affected by (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGL and domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The modest pace of United States economic growth resulted in higher demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks, resulting in higher raw material prices, though this did not have the same effect on all product prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Chemical segment earnings, excluding the gain on sale of the Carbocloro investment, decreased in 2013, primarily due to higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chlor-alkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals.
797468_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2013, the modest pace of the United States economic growth much of the year resulted in lackluster domestic demand and pricing for basic chemical products.
797468_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	Industry chlorine operating rates remained relatively flat with 2012 at approximately 84 percent, preventing chlorine price improvement, and prices ended approximately 4 percent below where they began.
797468_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain remained competitive as a result of the North American feedstock cost advantages, which are driven mostly by natural gas prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	quarters of 2013 and were slightly below the prior year levels for the whole year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	In the domestic market, anticipation of additional capacity coming online in early 2014 from the commissioning of three additional chlor-alkali plants, including OxyChem s 182,500-ton-per-year membrane plant in Tennessee, created downward pressure on liquid caustic soda prices during the second half of 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Export demand and pricing for liquid caustic soda was negatively impacted in mid-2013 by operational issues at a large Latin American alumina producer.
797468_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Businesses such as calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide improved compared to 2012 as domestic demand improved and margins remained stable throughout the year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	Vinyls Year-over-year domestic demand grew by more than 4 percent on the strength of the housing and commercial construction markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	This was offset by a decrease in exports, resulting in no change in industry operating rates in 2013 compared to 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Industry margins increased in 2013 due to higher PVC selling prices, partially offset by higher ethylene costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	North American, ethane-based ethylene continues to be cost-competitive versus prices in Europe and Asia, giving North American vinyl products an advantage in global markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P107_S4	Despite the year-over-year reduction in North American exports of PVC, export volumes represented nearly 35 percent of total PVC sales of North American producers.
797468_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Basic Chemicals Occidental expects that if the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve, domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	However, with forecasted capacity additions significantly exceeding closures, industry operating rates are expected to decline in 2014, resulting in increased competitive activity.
797468_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	Overall, improved demand in the face of increased capacity is anticipated to provide similar margins in 2014 for chlorine and caustic soda compared to 2013 levels.
797468_14_ITEM7_P109_S3	The continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remaining favorable compared to other global markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Vinyls North American demand and operating rates should improve in 2014 if growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues.
797468_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	Occidental expects export demand to remain firm and margins to improve over 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing, transportation and power generation assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	The marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market Occidental's and third-party volumes, trade commodities and engage in storage activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_14_ITEM7_P112_S3	The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013 , excluding the gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline, were greater than 2012, reflecting higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P112_S4	These improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to plant turnarounds in the Permian Basin operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Business Review Marketing and Trading The marketing and trading group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and engages in commodities trading.
797468_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P113_S3	In addition, Occidental s Phibro trading unit's strategy is to profit from market price changes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P113_S4	Marketing performance improved mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the Gulf Coast refineries.
797468_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Occidental s 2013 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2012 , which reflected lower NGL prices and plant turnarounds in the Permian Basin operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Occidental, together with ADNOC, is constructing a gas plant and facilities as part of the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi.
797468_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	The gas plant and facilities are expected to be completed and become operational in late 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Pipeline Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy.
797468_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 Bcf per day.
797468_14_ITEM7_P118_S3	Dolphin Pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity.
797468_14_ITEM7_P118_S4	Occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the Dolphin Pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows.
797468_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,800 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 616,000 barrels per day, 5.8 million barrels of active storage capability and 95 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Following the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of its investment, Occidental owns approximately 25 percent of Plains Pipeline, a publicly-traded oil and gas pipeline transportation, storage, terminalling and marketing entity operating in Canada and the western and southern United States.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	The Plains Pipeline investment contributed over 25 percent of the segment's earnings for 2013, excluding the gain from the sale.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	Occidental and Magellan are proceeding with construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline, which is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S3	The approximately 450-mile-long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil between the Permian region (Colorado City, Texas) and Gulf Coast refinery markets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S4	The BridgeTex Pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P120_S5	Occidental's 2013 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to higher volumes and pricing, and higher income from Plains Pipeline and the Dolphin Pipeline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and are generally not material.
797468_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGL prices, which cannot be predicted.
797468_14_ITEM7_P122_S2	Generally, higher NGL prices result in higher profitability.
797468_14_ITEM7_P122_S3	Although the marketing and the trading businesses individually can be volatile, the operations together tend to offset each other, significantly reducing the overall volatility of the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P122_S4	Based on its framework of controls and risk management systems, Occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole.
797468_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	(b) The 2013 amount includes $607 million of pre-tax charges related to the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S2	The 2012 amount includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S3	The 2011 amount includes pre-tax charges of $35 million related to exploration write-offs in Libya and $29 million related to a Colombian net worth tax, and a pre-tax gain from the sale of an interest in a Colombian pipeline of $22 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S4	(c) The 2013 amount includes a $131 million pre-tax gain from the sale of an investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian chemical facility.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S5	(d) The 2013 amount includes a $1,030 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline and other items.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S6	(e) The 2011 amount includes a pre-tax charge of $163 million related to the premium on debt extinguishment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S7	(f) The 2013 amount includes a $55 million pre-tax charge for the estimated cost related to the employment and post-employment benefits for the Company's former Executive Chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P126_S8	The 2011 amount includes a $144 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	(a) The 2013 amount includes pre-tax charges of $607 million for the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	The 2012 amount includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	(a) For all periods presented, excludes volumes and amounts from the Argentine operations sold in 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	(b) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2013 included pre-tax charges of $0.6 billion for the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage while earnings in 2012 included pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	In 2011, oil and gas segment earnings included pre-tax charges of $35 million related to exploration write-offs in Libya and $29 million related to Colombia net worth tax, as well as a pre-tax gain of $22 million from the sale of an interest in a Colombian pipeline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S2	Oil and gas segment earnings, prior to the impairment charges in both years, were $8.5 billion in 2013 compared to $8.8 billion in 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S3	The year-over-year change in earnings resulted from higher domestic earnings, which were more than offset by lower international earnings.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S4	Higher domestic earnings resulted from improved oil and gas realized prices, higher liquids volumes and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher DD A rates, stock price driven increases in equity compensation and lower NGL prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S5	Lower international earnings were caused by lower liquids sales volumes, lower oil prices and higher operating costs and DD A rates in the Middle East/North Africa.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S6	Average production costs for 2013, excluding taxes other than on income, were $13.76 per BOE, compared to $14.99 per BOE for 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S7	This decrease reflected the impact of the domestic operational efficiency initiative where production costs decreased by $3.00 per BOE from $17.43 per BOE in 2012 to $14.43 per BOE in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S8	The domestic decrease was partially offset by higher international production costs due to higher volumes from Iraq, which has high operating costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S9	Average daily oil and gas production volumes were 763,000 BOE for 2013, compared to 766,000 BOE for 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S10	Occidental's daily domestic oil and NGL production increased by 11,000 BOE and 4,000 BOE, respectively, while gas production decreased by 33 MMcf.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S11	These results reflect Occidental's focus on oil drilling while reducing its drilling capital for gas in light of higher oil prices and lower gas prices in recent years.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S12	While domestic overall production improved by 9,000 BOE per day in 2013, international production was 12,000 BOE per day lower, mainly due to lower cost recovery barrels in the Dolphin and Oman operations and field and port strikes in Libya.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S13	Average daily sales volumes were 762,000 BOE in the 12 months of 2013, compared to 764,000 BOE for the same period in 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S14	Oil and gas segment earnings, prior to the charges and other items noted above, were $8.8 billion in 2012 compared to $10.3 billion in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S15	The decrease reflected lower NGL and gas prices, and higher DD A rates, maintenance activity, field support costs and exploration expense, partially offset by higher oil prices and domestic volumes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S16	Average daily oil and gas production volumes were 766,000 BOE for 2012, compared to 733,000 BOE for 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P131_S17	Occidental's domestic production increased by 9 percent, while total company production increased by 5 percent.
797468_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	Average daily sales volumes were 764,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2012, compared to 731,000 BOE for the same period in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $612 million in 2013, excluding the $131 million gain on sale of the Carbocloro investment, compared to $720 million in 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	The year-over-year change in chemical segment earnings reflected higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chlor-alkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals and reduced export demand.
797468_14_ITEM7_P133_S2	Chemical segment earnings were $720 million in 2012, compared to $861 million in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P133_S3	The reduction was primarily the result of lower margins due to weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia and increased competitive activity from these regions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P133_S4	The calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide businesses were also negatively impacted in 2012 by a mild winter and drought conditions in the United States.
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013 were $543 million, excluding the $1.0 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline and other items, compared to $439 million in 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S1	The 2013 results reflected higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S2	Marketing performance improved by $110 million, mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the Gulf Coast refineries.
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S3	These improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to the plant turnarounds in the Permian Basin operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S4	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012 were $439 million, compared to $448 million in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P134_S5	The 2012 results reflected lower gas processing earnings, partially offset by improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
797468_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	(a) The 2011 amount includes a $144 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.6 billion, were $7.0 billion at December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P137_S1	The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $150 million is included in other current assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P137_S2	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	Occidental s 2013 worldwide tax rate was 39 percent, slightly lower than 2012 due to proportionately higher domestic pre-tax income in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	The 2012 worldwide tax rate was higher than 2011 due to proportionately higher foreign pre-tax income in 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $134 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of operations are discussed below:
797468_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	The increase in net sales in 2013, compared to 2012, was mainly due to improved domestic oil and gas realized prices and higher liquids volumes, partially offset by lower international liquids volumes and oil prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	The increase in net sales in 2012, compared to 2011, was due to higher oil volumes and prices, partially offset by lower gas and NGL prices and lower prices and volumes across most chemical products.
797468_14_ITEM7_P142_S2	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	The 2013 gain on sale of equity investments relates to the pre-tax gains from the sales of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and the Carbocloro investment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	Cost of sales decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to lower oil and gas operating costs, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	reflected a wide range of initiatives, including high-grading of service rigs, improved job scheduling and liquids usage and handling, optimizing field supervision and reduced consumption of fuel, power and field rental equipment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	Cost of sales increased in 2012, compared to 2011, due to higher oil and gas volumes and operating costs, mostly resulting from higher maintenance activity and field support costs, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs in the chemical segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P145_S2	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2013 due to higher compensation and employee-related costs, in particular higher equity compensation due to higher stock prices and higher headcount in 2013 compared to 2012, as well as the charge related to the employment and post-employment benefits for Occidental's former Executive Chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P145_S3	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2012 due to higher headcount, partially offset by lower equity compensation expense and the Colombia net worth tax, which increased the 2011 costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	DD A increased in each year from 2011 to 2013 , generally due to higher DD A rates and, to a lesser extent, the changes in volumes in the oil and gas segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	Asset impairments and related items in 2013 of $621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage.
797468_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	Asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than five years ago on average when gas prices were above $6 per Mcf.
797468_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	Taxes other than on income increased in each year from 2011 to 2013 , due to higher domestic oil volumes and oil and gas prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P148_S1	During the period from 2011 to 2013, these expenses also reflected increasing domestic ad valorem taxes resulting from higher property values and California greenhouse gas costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P148_S2	Interest and debt expense, net, in 2011, included a $163 million early debt extinguishment charge .
797468_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Provision for income taxes increased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	The lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pre-tax income in 2013, compared to 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P149_S2	Provision for income taxes decreased in 2012, compared to 2011, due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P149_S3	The higher tax rate was due to higher proportional foreign pre-tax income in 2012, compared to 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	Discontinued operations, net, in 2011, included the $144 million after-tax gain recorded from the sale of the Argentine operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents.
797468_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	The increase in trade receivables, net, was due to higher oil and gas prices and higher equity and third-party oil volumes at the end of 2013, compared to the end of 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	The decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower storage inventories.
797468_14_ITEM7_P153_S2	The decrease in other current assets mainly reflected the collection of a tax refund in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P153_S3	The decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sales of a portion of Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline and the investment in Carbocloro.
797468_14_ITEM7_P153_S4	The increase in PP E, net, was due to capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, partially offset by DD A and asset impairments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	The decrease in current maturities of long-term debt was due to the redemption of the $600 million senior notes that matured in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	The increase in accounts payable reflected higher oil and gas prices, higher equity and third-party oil volumes and higher capital expenditures at the end of 2013, compared to the end of 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend during that year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P155_S1	The increase in domestic and foreign income taxes reflected the lack of a 2012 accrual resulting from a refund due at the end of that year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P155_S2	The increase in deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes was mainly due to faster tax depreciation on capital expenditures.
797468_14_ITEM7_P155_S3	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to the reduction of pension and postretirement plan liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P155_S4	The increase in stockholders' equity reflected net income for 2013 and reduced pension and postretirement obligations, partially offset by dividends and treasury stock purchases.
797468_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2013 , Occidental had approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
797468_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	While a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States, Occidental believes the cash in foreign jurisdictions can be brought to the United States without paying significant taxes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2016.
797468_14_ITEM7_P158_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_14_ITEM7_P158_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_14_ITEM7_P158_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_14_ITEM7_P158_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2013 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_14_ITEM7_P159_S3	Occidental also has a shelf registration statement that facilitates future issuances of securities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	Occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	At this time, Occidental does not anticipate any need for such funding.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	Net income increased by $1.3 billion in 2013 compared to 2012, while cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.6 billion.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	These differences reflect working capital changes and collection of a tax refund increased cash flow from operations by $1.8 billion in 2013, compared to 2012, offset by the $1.2 billion gains on sales of equity investments in 2013 and $0.3 billion of lower non-cash charges.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S2	The most significant changes in non-cash charges from 2012 to 2013 were lower asset impairments by $1.1 billion, partially offset by higher DD A expenses by $0.8 billion.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S3	The 2013 net income included gains on the sales of equity investments for which cash is reported as an investing activity.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S4	The increase in operating cash flows in 2013, compared to 2012, also reflected lower domestic oil and gas operating costs, 3-percent and 29-percent higher domestic prices for oil and gas, respectively, and higher domestic oil volumes, partially offset by the Middle East/North Africa's lower oil volumes and prices and higher operating costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S5	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S6	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the changes in oil and gas product prices and volumes and operating costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S7	Although net income decreased by $2.2 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period of 2011, net cash provided by operating activities only decreased by $1.0 billion for this period.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S8	Compared to 2011, net income in 2012 included much larger non-cash charges, which reduced net income but not cash provided by operating activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S9	These non-cash charges mainly comprised asset impairments and higher DD A. Working capital changes in 2012 further reduced cash flow from operations by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S10	Additionally, operating cash flows in 2012, compared to 2011, reflected lower domestic gas and worldwide NGL prices, by 35 percent and 19 percent, respectively, and higher maintenance activity and field support costs, partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and 2-percent higher worldwide oil prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S11	The positive cash-flow impact of the oil price change was more than offset by the negative effect of significant declines in gas and NGL prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S12	The decrease in operating cash flows in 2012, compared to 2011, also reflected lower chemical margins, primarily due to weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia.
797468_14_ITEM7_P161_S13	The impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments are significantly smaller.
797468_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Other non-cash charges to income in 2013, 2012 and 2011 included charges for stock-based compensation plans and asset retirement obligation accruals.
797468_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	Operating cash flows for discontinued operations include the Argentine operations through the date they were sold in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	Compared to $10.2 billion in 2012, Occidental's net capital expenditures for 2013 were $8.8 billion after $0.2 billion in BridgeTex partner contributions, which are included in financing activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S1	The decrease in capital expenditures of $1.4 billion from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the $1.2 billion decrease in oil and gas expenditures, a majority of which was in domestic properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S2	This reduction reflected cost savings from Occidental's efficiency initiatives.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S3	The increase for the chemical segment was due to the continued construction of the Tennessee chlor-alkali facility.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S4	The decrease in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to lower spending for the Al Hosn gas project, partially offset by increased spending for BridgeTex.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S5	Occidental s net capital spending is expected to increase in 2014 to approximately $10.2 billion, compared to $8.8 billion in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S6	Approximately $1.2 billion of the increase will be in the oil and gas segment and includes additional capital allocated to the California and Permian Basin operations of approximately $0.4 billion each.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S7	Those operations will use the capital almost entirely for additional oil drilling to accelerate their development plans and production growth.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S8	An additional $0.1 billion is expected to be spent on these and other domestic assets for facilities projects that were deferred in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S9	Occidental also expects to continue to fund growth opportunities in key international assets, mainly Oman and Qatar, which will get approximately $0.3 billion of the increased capital, and complete the Al Hosn gas project, where the capital expenditures are expected to be lower in 2014 compared to 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S10	Exploration capital is expected to increase by approximately $0.1 billion, in part due to deferred spending in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P164_S11	The total midstream and marketing capital will increase by approximately $0.1 billion for the BridgeTex Pipeline and the chemical capital will increase slightly due to the ethylene cracker project announced in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	7 percent in domestic midstream and marketing and the remainder in the chemical segment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	The 2013 other investing activities, net amount included $1.6 billion of cash received from the sales of a portion of Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline and the investment in Carbocloro, partially offset by $0.6 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S2	The increase in capital expenditures of $2.7 billion from 2011 to 2012 was mainly due to the $2.1 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures, a majority of which was in domestic properties, such as Permian and California, as well as increases throughout the Middle East.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S3	The increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S4	The 2012 other investing activities, net amount included $2.5 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin, the Williston Basin, California and South Texas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S5	Also included in 2012 investing activities was approximately $190 million of cash dividends received as investment returns.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S6	The 2011 other investing activities, net amount included $4.9 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets, including various interests in domestic oil and gas properties, in operated, producing and non-producing properties in California and the Permian and Williston basins for approximately $2.4 billion, properties in South Texas for $1.8 billion and $0.5 billion for Occidental s share of pre-acquisition development expenditures incurred by the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S7	Investing cash flow from discontinued operations included $2.6 billion of cash received from the sale of the Argentine operations in 2011.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S8	Commitments at December 31, 2013 , for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately $2.1 billion , which will be due in 2014 and beyond.
797468_14_ITEM7_P165_S9	Occidental expects to fund its commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	The 2013 net cash used by financing activities included $0.7 billion used to retire debt and $0.2 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest.
797468_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	Common stock dividends paid decreased by $0.6 billion to $1.6 billion in 2013, due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that year's fourth quarter dividend.
797468_14_ITEM7_P166_S2	In addition, purchases of treasury stock increased from $0.6 billion in 2012 to over $0.9 billion in 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P166_S3	Higher 2013 net cash use compared to 2012 also reflected the net proceeds in 2012 of approximately $1.7 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes that year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	In 2012 common stock dividends paid increased by $0.7 billion to $2.1 billion compared to 2011, which included the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend.
797468_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	In addition, purchases of treasury stock increased from $0.3 billion in 2011 to $0.6 billion in 2012.
797468_14_ITEM7_P167_S2	The 2012 cash flows also reflected $1.7 billion of proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P167_S3	The 2011 amount included net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and cash use of $1.5 billion to retire long-term debt.
797468_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of Occidental's off-balance-sheet arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	Guarantees Occidental has guaranteed certain equity investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_14_ITEM7_P169_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $354 million of Dolphin s debt.
797468_14_ITEM7_P169_S2	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_14_ITEM7_P169_S3	See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Qatar" and Segment Results of Operations for further information about Dolphin.
797468_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_14_ITEM7_P170_S1	Occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility.
797468_14_ITEM7_P170_S2	Lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
797468_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	The table below summarizes and cross-references Occidental s contractual obligations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	This summary indicates on- and off-balance-sheet obligations as of December 31, 2013 .

797468_14_ITEM7_P172_S3	Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.1-percent discount rate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	Delivery Commitments Occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, gas and NGLs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	The total amount contracted to be delivered, a substantial majority of which is in the United States, is approximately 73 million barrels of oil through 2019, 83 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 15 million barrels of NGLs through 2015.
797468_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
797468_14_ITEM7_P173_S3	Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.
797468_14_ITEM7_P173_S4	None of the commitments in any given year is expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S2	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S3	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S4	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S5	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_14_ITEM7_P175_S6	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P176_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P176_S3	Environmental matters are further discussed under the caption "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" below.
797468_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P178_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental's income taxes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_14_ITEM7_P179_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_14_ITEM7_P180_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.
797468_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P182_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 157 sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 10 of the 157 sites described above, and 108 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a former facility in New York accounted for 60 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 74 third-party sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S4	Three of the remaining 66 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a containment and removal project in Tennessee and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 52 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S5	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 61 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P185_S6	Four other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 64 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P186_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $380 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P187_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	Environmental Costs Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM7_P190_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P190_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $130 million for 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_14_ITEM7_P191_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $13.7 billion, or approximately 20 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_14_ITEM7_P191_S2	Of such assets, approximately $11.9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately $1.7 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_14_ITEM7_P191_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , net sales outside North America totaled $8.2 billion, or approximately 34 percent of total net sales.
797468_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_14_ITEM7_P192_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P192_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_14_ITEM7_P192_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_14_ITEM7_P192_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and any impairment charges.
797468_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P195_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P195_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P195_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_14_ITEM7_P195_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_14_ITEM7_P195_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_14_ITEM7_P196_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_14_ITEM7_P196_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_14_ITEM7_P196_S2	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_14_ITEM7_P197_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_14_ITEM7_P197_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P198_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P198_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_14_ITEM7_P199_S5	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S0	future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S1	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S2	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S3	In 2013 , revisions of previous estimates provided a net 4 million BOE increase in proved reserves, which amounted to less than 1 percent of Occidental's total reserves as of December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S4	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties when product prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly, other significant events occur or management's plans change with respect to these properties in a manner that may impact Occidental's ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S5	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of undiscounted future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S6	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, when applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S7	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S8	The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S9	For example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.85 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $240 million annually at current production rates.
797468_14_ITEM7_P200_S10	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $3.6 billion.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management decided not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_14_ITEM7_P201_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_14_ITEM7_P202_S0	During its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2013, management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices, availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P202_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $0.6 billion for the acreage.
797468_14_ITEM7_P203_S0	The profitability of certain of Occidental's Middle East/North Africa operations, and in turn its ability to realize its recorded asset values, is dependent upon the success of future development plans or normalization of operations in some locations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P203_S1	Further, the strategic review Occidental is currently undertaking may result in the sale of certain assets, some of which may result in losses.
797468_14_ITEM7_P203_S2	Such losses, if any, will be recorded when a definitive sale decision is made.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S0	Chemical Assets Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_14_ITEM7_P204_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P205_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P205_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM7_P206_S0	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.8 billion and its depreciation expense for 2014 is expected to be approximately $325 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P206_S1	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_14_ITEM7_P206_S2	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $45 million per year.
797468_14_ITEM7_P207_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_14_ITEM7_P208_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_14_ITEM7_P208_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_14_ITEM7_P209_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_14_ITEM7_P209_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_14_ITEM7_P210_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_14_ITEM7_P211_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_14_ITEM7_P211_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P212_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_14_ITEM7_P213_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_14_ITEM7_P213_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_14_ITEM7_P214_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_14_ITEM7_P215_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_14_ITEM7_P215_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM7_P216_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P216_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_14_ITEM7_P217_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P217_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_14_ITEM7_P217_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_14_ITEM7_P217_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_14_ITEM7_P218_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_14_ITEM7_P218_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_14_ITEM7_P219_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_14_ITEM7_P219_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_14_ITEM7_P219_S2	Occidental generally classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_14_ITEM7_P220_S0	Embedded commodity derivatives Occidental values embedded commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_14_ITEM7_P220_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are observable and unobservable in the marketplace, and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_14_ITEM7_P221_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_14_ITEM7_P221_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S0	Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_14_ITEM7_P222_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_14_ITEM7_P223_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM7_P224_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_14_ITEM7_P224_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_14_ITEM7_P225_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_14_ITEM7_P225_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_14_ITEM7_P226_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_14_ITEM7_P227_S0	consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_14_ITEM7_P227_S1	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_14_ITEM7_P227_S2	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_14_ITEM7_P227_S3	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_14_ITEM7_P228_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_14_ITEM7_P228_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $33 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P228_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $33 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S1	Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S4	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S5	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.
797468_14_ITEM7_P229_S6	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Other Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_14_ITEM7_P230_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES Listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P231_S0	Offsetting Assets and Liabilities Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Occidental adopted new disclosure requirements relating to its derivatives in accordance with rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in December 2011 and January 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P231_S1	These new rules require tabular disclosures of the outstanding derivatives' gross and net fair values, now including those derivatives that are subject to a master netting or similar arrangement and qualify for net presentation, whether or not offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
797468_14_ITEM7_P232_S0	Reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Occidental adopted new disclosure requirements for reporting amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income into the income statement in accordance with rules issued by the FASB in February 2013.
797468_14_ITEM7_P233_S0	These new disclosures were not material to Occidental's financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S0	DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $150 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $100 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S5	The marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil, gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S7	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S8	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P234_S9	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $25 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P235_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_14_ITEM7_P236_S0	According to IHS Chemical, December 2013 average contract prices were: chlorine $245 per ton; caustic soda $583 per ton; and PVC $0.61 per lb.
797468_14_ITEM7_P237_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_14_ITEM7_P237_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM7_P237_S2	Additionally, Occidental s Phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S0	Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a Risk Management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S2	Members of the Risk Management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S3	The President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President of Operations also oversee these controls.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S4	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_14_ITEM7_P238_S5	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_14_ITEM7_P239_S0	Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value.
797468_14_ITEM7_P239_S1	Fair values for these contracts are derived principally from Level 1 and Level 2 sources.
797468_14_ITEM7_P239_S2	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_14_ITEM7_P240_S0	Note : Includes cash-flow hedges further discussed below.
797468_14_ITEM7_P241_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental entered into financial swap agreements in November 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in California.
797468_14_ITEM7_P241_S1	These swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in January 2013 through March 2014 and qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_14_ITEM7_P241_S2	The weighted-average strike price of these swaps is $4.30.
797468_14_ITEM7_P242_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P242_S1	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 31, 2014.
797468_14_ITEM7_P243_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P243_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 13 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P244_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the total fair value of cash-flow hedges, which was a net liability of $4 million, was included in the total fair value table in "Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts" above.
797468_14_ITEM7_P245_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_14_ITEM7_P245_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95-percent level of confidence.
797468_14_ITEM7_P245_S2	Additionally, Occidental uses trading limits, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_14_ITEM7_P245_S3	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P246_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P246_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_14_ITEM7_P247_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_14_ITEM7_P247_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_14_ITEM7_P248_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $25 million.
797468_14_ITEM7_P249_S0	Credit Risk Occidental's credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
797468_14_ITEM7_P250_S0	Occidental s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P251_S0	Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis.
797468_14_ITEM7_P251_S1	Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure.
797468_14_ITEM7_P252_S0	A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_14_ITEM7_P252_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S4	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had a net liability of $8 million and $34 million, respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $23 million and $64 million, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties.
797468_14_ITEM7_P253_S7	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2013 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_14_ITEM7_P254_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_14_ITEM7_P254_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_14_ITEM7_P254_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_14_ITEM7_P254_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_14_ITEM7_P254_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_14_ITEM7_P255_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_14_ITEM7_P256_S0	SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 (including the information appearing under the captions Oil and Gas Operations - Competition, Chemical Operations - Competition, and Midstream and Marketing Operations - Competition ), Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," and Items 7 and 7A (including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub-captions "Strategy," "Oil and Gas Segment -Business Review," Proved Reserves and "- Industry Outlook," "Chemical Segment - Industry Outlook," "Midstream, Marketing and Other Segment - Business Review, Gas Processing Plants and CO2 Fields and Facilities" and "- Business Review, Pipeline Transportation," "- Industry Outlook," "Taxes," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," Contractual Obligations - Delivery Commitments, "Lawsuits, Claims and Other Contingencies," "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," and "Derivative Activities and Market Risk"), contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.

797468_14_ITEM7_P258_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include items noted in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and elsewhere, and also include the need for final Board of Directors approval of the California separation.
797468_14_ITEM7_P259_S0	Occidental posts or provides links to important information on its website at www.oxy.com.
797468_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P0_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts.
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_14_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S4	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_14_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 3, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_14_ITEM8_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 1992 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , and our report dated March 3, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

797468_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of the oil and gas, chemical and midstream, marketing and other (midstream and marketing) segments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas.
797468_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement.
797468_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	Management believes that these estimates and judgments provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 , and net sales of approximately $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $2.9 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	INVENTORIES Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Oil, NGL and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_14_ITEM8_P31_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_14_ITEM8_P31_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_14_ITEM8_P34_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties when product prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly, other significant events occur or management's plans change with respect to these properties in a manner that may impact Occidental's ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	Impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of undiscounted future cash flows, which can change significantly over time.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S4	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, which Occidental bases on forward price curves and, when applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P38_S5	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $3.6 billion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S3	As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proved, capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S4	If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, or management decided not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_14_ITEM8_P39_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_14_ITEM8_P40_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_14_ITEM8_P44_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Commodity derivatives Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	Occidental classifies these measurements as Level 2.
797468_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Embedded commodity derivatives Occidental values embedded commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are observable and unobservable in the marketplace, and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $459 million and $385 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_14_ITEM8_P50_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P57_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1,283 million and $1,212 million is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	For cash- and stock-settled total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from the Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	Compensation expense for RSUs and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S3	Compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of the TSRI awards and related dividends is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance criteria.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S4	For RSUs, compensation expense for the cash-settled portion of the awards is adjusted for changes in the value of the underlying stock on a quarterly basis.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S5	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_14_ITEM8_P68_S6	The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $1.8 billion , $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately $792 million, $694 million and $635 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States.
797468_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	Interest paid totaled approximately $238 million , $190 million and $315 million for the years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	The 2011 interest paid included $154 million of debt extinguishment premiums.
797468_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income.
797468_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.
797468_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In February 2014, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Hugoton Field operations in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado for pre-tax proceeds of $1.4 billion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	Occidental s average net production from the Hugoton Field properties in 2013 was approximately 110 million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas per day, of which approximately 30 percent was oil.
797468_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	Occidental anticipates the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2014 and expects to report a gain on the sale.
797468_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	In February 2014, the Board of Directors authorized initiation of efforts to separate its California assets into an independent and separately traded company.
797468_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the pursuit of the sale of a minority interest in the Middle East/North Africa operations, the strategic alternatives for select assets, including oil and gas interests in the Williston Basin, Hugoton Field, Piceance Basin and other Rocky Mountain assets and the sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in the Plains All-American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains Pipeline).
797468_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, Occidental paid approximately $0.5 billion to acquire certain domestic oil and gas properties.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	In October 2013, Occidental and Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V. (Mexichem) formed Ingleside Ethylene, LLC (Ingleside) to build and operate an ethane steam cracking unit capable of producing 1.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year (Cracker), which is expected to begin operating in 2017.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	With the ethylene produced from the Cracker, Occidental will produce vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), of which Mexichem has contracted to purchase a substantial majority.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2013, Occidental had invested approximately $23 million in Ingleside for its portion of construction costs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S3	In May 2013, Occidental sold its investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian chemical facility.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S4	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $270 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $131 million.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S5	Dr. Ray Irani submitted his resignation as a director, effective as of May 15, 2013, and ceased serving as an executive of Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S6	In addition, certain other employees and several consulting arrangements were terminated during the second quarter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S7	As a result of these developments and actions, Occidental recorded a $55 million pre-tax charge in the second quarter for the estimated costs of Dr. Irani's employment and post-employment benefits, and the termination of other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S8	Dr. Irani and Occidental have settled all matters relating to his separation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S9	The cost of the settlement was consistent with the estimated charge recorded in the second quarter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P83_S10	Dr. Irani's employment terminated in December 2013.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, Occidental paid approximately $2.3 billion for domestic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin, Williston Basin, South Texas and California.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	In November 2012, Occidental and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) formed BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC (BridgeTex) and are proceeding with construction of the BridgeTex Pipeline, which is expected to begin service in mid-2014.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	The approximately 450 - mile-long pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil between the Permian region (Colorado City, Texas) and Gulf Coast refinery markets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S3	The BridgeTex Pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 2.6 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S4	Occidental owns a 50 percent interest in BridgeTex and the remaining 50 percent interest is owned by Magellan, which will be the operator.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S5	BridgeTex was determined to be a variable interest entity because of the difference between Occidental's economic interests and its decision-making rights.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S6	Occidental is the primary beneficiary and consequently consolidates BridgeTex.
797468_14_ITEM8_P84_S7	This investment is not material to Occidental's financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the BridgeTex assets and liabilities mainly comprised cash and cash equivalents and PP E.
797468_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2013, BridgeTex's total cash, PP E and non-controlling amounts (reflecting Magellan's interests) were $82 million, $420 million and $246 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2012, these amounts were $50 million, $9 million and $32 million, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	BridgeTex's assets cannot be used for the obligations of, nor do BridgeTex's creditors have recourse to, OPC or its other subsidiaries.
797468_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, Occidental acquired producing properties in South Texas for approximately $1.8 billion .
797468_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	Occidental also acquired approximately $2.6 billion of other domestic oil and gas assets, which included properties in California, as well as the Permian and Williston basins.
797468_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	In the first quarter of 2011, Occidental completed the sale of its Argentine oil and gas operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	Internationally, in the first quarter of 2011, Occidental acquired a 40 -percent participating interest in the Al Hosn gas project in Abu Dhabi, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in a 30 -year joint venture agreement.
797468_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	The project is operated by Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company Limited.
797468_14_ITEM8_P87_S3	In May 2011, Occidental paid approximately $500 million for its share of pre-acquisition development expenditures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	In early 2011, Occidental ceased exploration activity and its participation in production operations in Libya due to civil unrest in the country and United States sanctions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	As a result, Occidental wrote off the entire amount of the capitalized and suspended exploration costs incurred to date, including lease acquisition costs, of approximately $35 million in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	The United States government lifted its sanctions in September 2011 and Occidental resumed its participation in the producing operations at that time.
797468_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Offsetting Assets and Liabilities Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Occidental adopted new disclosure requirements relating to its derivatives in accordance with rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in December 2011 and January 2013.
797468_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	These new rules require tabular disclosures of the outstanding derivatives' gross and net fair values, now including those derivatives that are subject to a master netting or similar arrangement and qualify for net presentation, whether or not offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
797468_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Occidental adopted new disclosure requirements for reporting amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income into the income statement in accordance with rules issued by the FASB in February 2013.
797468_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	These new disclosures were not material to Occidental's financial statements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $205 million and $185 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	Long-term debt consisted of the following:
797468_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2016.
797468_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_14_ITEM8_P94_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_14_ITEM8_P94_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_14_ITEM8_P94_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2013 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	In December 2013, all $600 million of the outstanding 1.45-percent senior notes due 2013 matured.
797468_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	In addition, Occidental repurchased approximately $90 million of various senior notes due in 2021 and later.
797468_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	In June 2012, Occidental issued $1.75 billion of debt which comprised $1.25 billion of 2.70 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500 million of 1.50 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2018.
797468_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.74 billion .
797468_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August for each series of notes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	In August 2011, Occidental issued $2.15 billion of debt, which comprised $1.25 billion of 1.75 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $900 million of 3.125 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2022.
797468_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion .
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August for each series of notes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	In March 2011, Occidental redeemed all $1.0 billion of its outstanding 7-percent senior notes due 2013 and all $368 million of its outstanding 6.75 -percent senior notes due 2012.
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S2	Occidental recorded a $163-million pre-tax charge related to this redemption in the first quarter of 2011.
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S3	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $354 million and $370 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt.
797468_14_ITEM8_P99_S5	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	At December 31, 2013 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $7.0 billion, of which none is due in 2014 and 2015 , $1.5 billion is due in 2016 , $1.2 billion is due in 2017 , $0.5 billion is due in 2018 and $3.8 billion is due in 2019 and thereafter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $7.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $7.0 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses.
797468_14_ITEM8_P103_S2	At December 31, 2013 , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:
797468_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	(a) These amounts are net of sublease rentals of $3 million, which are to be received in 2014 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	Rental expense for operating leases, net of sublease rental income for continuing operations, was $204 million in 2013 , $176 million in 2012 and $179 million in 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P105_S1	Rental expense was net of sublease income of $3 million in 2013 and $4 million each in 2012 and 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM8_P106_S2	Additionally, Occidental s Phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P106_S3	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental entered into financial swap agreements in November 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in California.
797468_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	These swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in January 2013 through March 2014 and qualify as cash-flow hedges.
797468_14_ITEM8_P107_S2	The weighted-average strike price of these swaps is $4.30.
797468_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Through March 31, 2012, Occidental held financial swap agreements related to the sale of 50 million cubic feet per day of its existing natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States that qualified as cash-flow hedges at a weighted-average strike price of $6.07 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	Through December 31, 2011, Occidental held a series of collar agreements for 12,000 barrels of oil per day of its domestic production that qualified as cash-flow hedges at a weighted-average strike price that ranged from $32.92 to $46.35 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	Occidental s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 31, 2014.
797468_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 13 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following table presents the after-tax gains and losses recognized in, and reclassified to income from, AOCI, for derivative instruments classified as cash-flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	Occidental expects to reclassify an insignificant amount, based on the valuation as of December 31, 2013 , of net after-tax derivative losses from AOCI into income during the next 12 months.
797468_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	The gains and losses reclassified to income were recognized in net sales, and the amount of the ineffective portion of cash-flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	The following table summarizes Occidental's net volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative contracts as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
797468_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	The volumes in the table above exclude contracts tied to index prices, for which the fair value, if any, is minimal at any point in time.
797468_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	These contracts do not expose Occidental to price risk because the contract prices fluctuate with index prices.
797468_14_ITEM8_P114_S2	In addition, Occidental typically has certain other commodity trading contracts, such as agricultural products, power and other metals, as well as foreign exchange contracts.
797468_14_ITEM8_P114_S3	These contracts were not material to Occidental as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	Occidental fulfills its short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.
797468_14_ITEM8_P115_S1	Subsequent to December 31, 2013, Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial portion of the outstanding positions at year-end and has sufficient production capacity and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P115_S2	Approximately $11 million and $49 million of net gains from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S1	(b) As of December 31, 2013 , collateral received of $11 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $46 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S2	(c) As of December 31, 2012 , collateral received of $25 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $95 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S3	(d) Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S4	Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $103 million and $116 million deposited by Occidental has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables.
797468_14_ITEM8_P116_S5	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	See Note 15 for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives.
797468_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	Credit Risk A substantial portion of Occidental s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S4	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had a net liability of $8 million and $34 million , respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $23 million and $64 million , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P119_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_14_ITEM8_P120_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P120_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_14_ITEM8_P120_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_14_ITEM8_P120_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 157 sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ( $78 million in 2013 , $80 million in 2012 and $79 million in 2011 ) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ( $252 million in 2013 , $264 million in 2012 and $281 million in 2011 ).
797468_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 10 of the 157 sites described above, and 108 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a former facility in New York accounted for 60 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 74 third-party sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P127_S1	Three of the remaining 66 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a containment and removal project in Tennessee and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 52 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P127_S2	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 61 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P127_S3	Four other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 64 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P128_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P129_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $380 million .
797468_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_14_ITEM8_P133_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_14_ITEM8_P133_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_14_ITEM8_P133_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_14_ITEM8_P133_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_14_ITEM8_P134_S2	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_14_ITEM8_P135_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P135_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_14_ITEM8_P136_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P137_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_14_ITEM8_P138_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P139_S2	At December 31, 2013 , total purchase obligations were $10.0 billion, which included approximately $3.0 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion that will be paid in 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 and 2018 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P139_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2014 and thereafter, which were approximately $2.1 billion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P140_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_14_ITEM8_P140_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	The current portion of total deferred tax assets was $150 million and $250 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, which was reported in other current assets.
797468_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P145_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	Occidental had, as of December 31, 2013 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.1 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2022, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S2	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $10.6 billion, net of foreign taxes, at December 31, 2013 , as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S3	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $134 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S4	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $9 million, $7 million and $86 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S5	Additional paid-in capital was credited $6 million in 2013 , $8 million in 2012 and $14 million in 2011 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_14_ITEM8_P146_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $61 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount.
797468_14_ITEM8_P148_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_14_ITEM8_P149_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:
797468_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	TREASURY STOCK In February 2014, Occidental increased the number of shares authorized for its share repurchase program by 30 million from 95 million shares; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	In 2013 and 2012 , respectively, Occidental purchased 10.3 million and 7.2 million shares under the program at an average cost of $94.42 and $77.98 per share.
797468_14_ITEM8_P152_S2	Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during each year.
797468_14_ITEM8_P152_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , treasury stock shares numbered 93.9 million, 83.3 million and 75.8 million, respectiv ely.
797468_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.
797468_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	At December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.
797468_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax amounts:
797468_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	(a) See Note 13 for further information.
797468_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	Occidental has established several Plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards including in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and TSRIs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P157_S1	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 16 million shares had been issued through December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P157_S2	Of the remaining shares, only approximately 20 million shares are available for grants of future awards because a plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_14_ITEM8_P157_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 20 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_14_ITEM8_P157_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	During 2013 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 37,100 shares of restricted stock, a substantial majority of which fully vested on the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_14_ITEM8_P158_S2	The following table summarizes certain stock-based incentive amounts for the past three years:
797468_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	(a) Includes cash paid under the cash-settled portion of the SARs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	(b) As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards, based on year-end valuation, was $205 million.
797468_14_ITEM8_P160_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	RSUs Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S2	These awards vest ratably over three years, or at the end of two or three years, following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S3	For certain three-year RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S4	For those awards that cliff vest in two or three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting period and are paid when they vest.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were $89.70, $84.38 and $104.74 per share, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S6	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were $90.35, $84.81 and $102.97, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P161_S7	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented below:
797468_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	TSRIs Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of a three-year period following the grant date if performance targets are certified as being met.
797468_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	TSRIs granted in July 2013 and 2012 have payouts that range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award and 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award, respectively, that would settle, once certified, fully in stock.
797468_14_ITEM8_P162_S2	TSRIs granted in July 2011 have payouts that range from 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award that would settle, once certified, 50 percent in stock and 50 percent in cash.
797468_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	Dividend equivalents for TSRIs are accumulated and paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_14_ITEM8_P166_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P166_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:

797468_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	(a) Presented at the target or mid-point payouts.
797468_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Options that are settled in stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
797468_14_ITEM8_P170_S1	No Options or SARs have been granted since 2006 and all outstanding awards are vested.
797468_14_ITEM8_P170_S2	Exercise prices of the Options and SARs were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P170_S3	Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years from the grant date with a maximum term of ten years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P170_S4	These Options and SARs may be forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.
797468_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	The fair value of each Option, stock-settled SAR or cash-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted-average life of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P171_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on US Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_14_ITEM8_P172_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_14_ITEM8_P172_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2013 :
797468_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	OTHER During 2013, Occidental also granted approximately 160,000 share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period beginning January 1, 2014, if performance targets based on returns on assets of the applicable segment or capital employed are certified as being met.
797468_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	These awards are settled in stock at the time of vesting, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_14_ITEM8_P174_S2	Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_14_ITEM8_P174_S3	The weighted-average, grant-date fair value of these awards was $80.98.
797468_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, age, level and employee contributions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P176_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_14_ITEM8_P176_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $166 million and $145 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $140 million in 2013 , $137 million in 2012 and $110 million in 2011 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 1,000 domestic and 1,500 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_14_ITEM8_P179_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $229 million in 2013 , $218 million in 2012 and $194 million in 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2014 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $6 million and zero, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $24 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2013 and 2012.
797468_14_ITEM8_P186_S1	The weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental s past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation.
797468_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
797468_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_14_ITEM8_P188_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 10.0 percent at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P188_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.5 percent to 10.0 percent in 2013 , depending on local economic conditions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P188_S3	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 6.5 percent in excess of local inflation in both 2013 and 2012 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 2.36 percent and 2.39 percent as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S2	For those union employees, Occidental projected that healthcare cost trend rates would decrease 0.25 percent per year from 8.0 percent in 2013 until they reach 5.0 percent in 2025, and remain at 5.0 percent thereafter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S3	A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed healthcare cost trend rates would result in an increase of $38 million or a reduction of $32 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S4	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P189_S5	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S1	The investments are monitored by Occidental s Investment Committee in its role as fiduciary.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S2	The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S3	Equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S4	Other asset classes such as private equity and real estate may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S5	The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P190_S6	Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
797468_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	(a) This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries.
797468_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	(b) This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P192_S2	(c) This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries.
797468_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	The activity during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , for the assets using Level 3 fair value measurements was insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Occidental expects to contribute $6 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during 2014 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion of equity-method investments, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENTS As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s equity investments consisted mainly of an approximate 25-percent interest in Plains Pipeline, a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, and various other partnerships and joint ventures.
797468_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	Equity investments paid dividends of $447 million, $526 million and $349 million to Occidental in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P197_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since their respective acquisitions totaled approximately $65 million.
797468_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $900 million, of which almost $750 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives.
797468_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments:
797468_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a 24.5 -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment.
797468_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	In October 2013, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion.
797468_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	, Occidental purchases oil, NGLs, power, steam and chemicals from and sells oil, NGLs, gas, chemicals and power to certain of its equity investees and other related parties at market-related prices.
797468_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the following amounts due from or to its related parties:
797468_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	In 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , sales of Occidental-produced oil and NGLs to Plains Pipeline accounted for 72 percent, 80 percent and 76 percent of these totals, respectively.
797468_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	Additionally, Occidental conducts marketing and trading activities with Plains Pipeline for oil and NGLs.
797468_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	These transactions are reported in Occidental's income statement on a net margin basis.
797468_14_ITEM8_P202_S3	The sales amounts above include the net margins on such transactions, which were negligible.
797468_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	FAIR VALUES RECURRING The following tables provide fair value measurement information for assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
797468_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	FAIR VALUES NONRECURRING During its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2013, management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices, availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $0.6 billion for the acreage.
797468_14_ITEM8_P204_S2	At year end 2012, Occidental performed impairment tests with respect to its proved and unproved properties due to the negative revisions to certain of its natural gas reserves and the continued deterioration of natural gas prices.
797468_14_ITEM8_P204_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2012, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.7 billion, almost all of which were for certain assets in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties, which were acquired more than five years ago on average.
797468_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows.
797468_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs and appropriate discount rates.
797468_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	These properties were impacted by persistently low natural gas prices in the United States changing management's development plans.
797468_14_ITEM8_P205_S3	Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
797468_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and other on-balance-sheet financial instruments, other than fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value.
797468_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	The cost, if any, to terminate off-balance-sheet financial instruments is not significant.
797468_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	Occidental conducts its continuing operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing.
797468_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas.
797468_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO 2 and power.
797468_14_ITEM8_P209_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P209_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P209_S3	Earnings of industry segments and geographic areas exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P211_S1	Corporate assets consist of cash, certain corporate receivables and PP E, and an investment in the Joslyn, Canada oil sands project.

797468_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	(b) Excludes proved oil reserves from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations of 166 MMbbl as of December 31, 2010.
797468_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	(c) Approximately 10 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2013 are nonproducing, the majority of which are located in the United States.
797468_14_ITEM8_P221_S3	(d) The amount of Occidental's proved undeveloped reserves that are not expected to be developed within five years from the date initially recorded was insignificant.
797468_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	A substantial portion of the Middle East/North Africa proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013, was from the Al Hosn gas project in the United Arab Emirates.
797468_14_ITEM8_P222_S1	Occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	(a) A substantial portion of proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements.

797468_14_ITEM8_P227_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_14_ITEM8_P228_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_14_ITEM8_P228_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P228_S2	For example, in 2013, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $97.97 per barrel and $3.66 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 25.

797468_14_ITEM8_P230_S1	Occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter.
797468_14_ITEM8_P231_S0	CAPITALIZED COSTS Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated DD A were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	(a) Includes acquisition costs, development costs, capitalized interest and asset retirement obligations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P233_S0	COSTS INCURRED Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P234_S0	Occidental s oil and gas producing activities for continuing operations, which exclude items such as asset dispositions, corporate overhead, interest and royalties, were as follows:
797468_14_ITEM8_P235_S0	(a) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P235_S1	(b) Production costs are the costs incurred in lifting the oil and gas to the surface and include gathering, primary processing, field storage and insurance on proved properties, but do not include DD A, royalties, income taxes, interest, general and administrative and other expenses.
797468_14_ITEM8_P235_S2	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_14_ITEM8_P236_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_14_ITEM8_P237_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_14_ITEM8_P237_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P237_S2	For example, in 2013, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $97.97 per barrel and $3.66 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 25.
797468_14_ITEM8_P238_S0	(b) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_14_ITEM8_P238_S1	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_14_ITEM8_P239_S0	For purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to Occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P239_S1	The realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P239_S2	Future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_14_ITEM8_P240_S0	Future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows.
797468_14_ITEM8_P240_S1	The discount was computed by application of a 10-percent discount factor.
797468_14_ITEM8_P240_S2	The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions at December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P240_S3	Such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past.
797468_14_ITEM8_P240_S4	Other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results.
797468_14_ITEM8_P241_S0	The following table sets forth, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , Occidental s approximate average sales prices in continuing operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P242_S0	(a) Excludes average sales prices from Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P243_S0	Net Productive and Dry Exploratory and Development Wells Completed The following table sets forth, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , Occidental s net productive and dry exploratory and development wells completed.
797468_14_ITEM8_P244_S0	(a) Excludes for all years presented the exploratory and development wells completed by Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P245_S0	Productive Oil and Gas Wells The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s productive oil and gas wells (both producing and capable of production).
797468_14_ITEM8_P246_S0	(a) The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of wells with multiple completions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P246_S1	(b) The total number of wells in which interests are owned.
797468_14_ITEM8_P246_S2	(c) The sum of fractional interests.
797468_14_ITEM8_P247_S0	Participation in Exploratory and Development Wells Being Drilled The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s participation in exploratory and development wells being drilled.
797468_14_ITEM8_P248_S0	At December 31, 2013 , Occidental was participating in 180 pressure-maintenance projects, mostly waterfloods, in the United States, 9 in Latin America and 47 in the Middle East/North Africa.
797468_14_ITEM8_P249_S0	The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2013 , Occidental s holdings of developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage.
797468_14_ITEM8_P250_S0	(a) Includes approximately 2.3 million acres in California, the large majority of which are net fee mineral interests.
797468_14_ITEM8_P250_S1	(b) Acres spaced or assigned to productive wells.
797468_14_ITEM8_P250_S2	(c) Total acres in which interests are held.
797468_14_ITEM8_P250_S3	(d) Sum of the fractional interests owned based on working interests, or interests under PSCs and other economic arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM8_P250_S4	(e) Acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves.
797468_14_ITEM8_P251_S0	Occidental s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases.
797468_14_ITEM8_P251_S1	Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.
797468_14_ITEM8_P251_S2	In some instances, Occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.
797468_14_ITEM8_P251_S3	In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions.
797468_14_ITEM8_P251_S4	Scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM8_P252_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
797468_14_ITEM8_P252_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_14_ITEM8_P253_S0	(a) For all periods presented, excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.
797468_14_ITEM8_P253_S1	(b) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_14_ITEM8_P253_S2	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_14_ITEM8_P253_S3	For example, in 2013, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $97.97 per barrel and $3.66 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 25.
797468_14_ITEM8_P254_S0	Note : The amounts presented represent continuing operations.
797468_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

797468_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on December 29, 2013 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2013.
797468_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of California, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in Bolivia and Colombia.
797468_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2013.
797468_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE.
797468_14_ITEM15_P52_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.
797468_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, and (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_14_ITEM15_P58_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_14_ITEM15_P58_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_14_ITEM15_P60_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2013; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2013 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Approximately 73 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	The remaining 27 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.
797468_14_ITEM15_P67_S3	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Approximately 1 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.
797468_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The remaining 99 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Of the properties reviewed, approximately 90 percent of the proved producing reserves and 64 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques.
797468_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO 2 injection and infill drilling.
797468_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2013 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s average realized prices.
797468_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
797468_14_ITEM15_P75_S2	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
797468_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_14_ITEM15_P79_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_14_ITEM15_P79_S4	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2013.
797468_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_14_ITEM15_P84_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P84_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_14_ITEM15_P84_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in Bolivia and Colombia reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S4	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in Bolivia and Colombia include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S5	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_14_ITEM15_P86_S6	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_14_ITEM15_P88_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_14_ITEM15_P91_S3	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2013.
797468_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

797468_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
797468_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
797468_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
797468_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
797468_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
797468_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_14_ITEM15_P112_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_14_ITEM15_P112_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_14_ITEM15_P112_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
797468_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
797468_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
797468_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
797468_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
797468_14_ITEM15_P115_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
797468_14_ITEM15_P115_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
797468_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
797468_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
797468_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
797468_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
797468_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
797468_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
797468_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
797468_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
797468_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
797468_14_ITEM15_P123_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
797468_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
797468_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
797468_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
797468_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
797468_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
797468_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
797468_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
797468_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
797468_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
797468_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
797468_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
797468_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
797468_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
797468_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
797468_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
797468_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
797468_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
797468_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(2)] , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in weather patterns and climatic changes.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The impacts of the members of OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Generally, Occidental's policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products in the future.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Recent global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Continued reductions in commodity prices could require us to further reduce capital spending, share repurchases, debt reduction, and impair the carrying value of assets.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Occidental's restructuring activities may affect its stock price.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Occidental has performed a strategic review of its operations, which resulted in the restructuring and the separation or divestiture of various assets.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	This activity and further implementation of the strategic review may affect the market value of Occidental's common stock.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For example, Occidental may take different actions than expected, receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Occidental s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the recent significant decline in oil prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Concerns about climate change may affect Occidental s operations.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Occidental could face risks of project execution, increased costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions or prohibition on the use of its products as a result of legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, or to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international, national and state GHG measures make it difficult to predict any business impact.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The occurrence of events, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes, other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed, may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Cyber attacks could significantly affect Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If, however, Occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed, the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and may not be fully comparable to that of other companies.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
797468_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Occidental has not received any written comments from the SEC staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding December 31, 2014 and that remain unresolved.
797468_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent a notice to an OPC subsidiary that it is seeking penalties of $165,600 related to a crude oil pipeline incident in Scurry County, Texas.
797468_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The subsidiary is contesting these proposed penalties.
797468_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	In the second quarter of 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection notified an OPC subsidiary that they are seeking penalties regarding the leak detection and repair program to control air emissions at a facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania.
797468_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The subsidiary is cooperating with the agencies to resolve the foregoing claim.
797468_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_15_ITEM4_P0_S0	The current term of office of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 1, 2015, organizational meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_15_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 28,000 stockholders of record at January 31, 2015, and by approximately 700,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	The quarterly dividends declared on the common stock were $0.72 for each quarter of 2014 ($2.88 for the year).
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	On February 11, 2015 , a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2015 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2015 .
797468_15_ITEM5_P0_S5	The current annual dividend rate of $2.88 per share has increased by 476 percent since 2002.
797468_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 , were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	(a) Includes purchases from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	(b) Represents the total number of shares remaining at year end under Occidental's share repurchase program of 185 million shares.
797468_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The program was initially announced in 2005.
797468_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s peer group over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in: (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500, and (iii) each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the peer group, and that all dividends were reinvested.

797468_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and power.
797468_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	STRATEGY General Through its operations, Occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The fourth quarter of 2014 saw a sharp decline in oil and NGLs prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business, and in order to manage this risk, Occidental maintains a low debt to capitalization ratio and retains sufficient cash on hand.
797468_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Occidental will focus on lowering its costs which over time management believes will correlate to increasing and decreasing oil prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	With respect to the strategic initiatives announced last year, Occidental has:
797468_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Sold its interest in the BridgeTex pipeline, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion while maintaining access to United States gulf markets through this pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result of these strategic initiatives, Occidental ended the year with $7.8 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which exceeds its long-term debt of $6.8 billion.
797468_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	The following describes the application of Occidental s overall strategy to each of its operating segments:
797468_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Oil and Gas The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy primarily by:
797468_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach towards domestic acquisitions and divestitures and the execution of international contracts, with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental's existing positions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Over the past several years, Occidental built a large portfolio of growth-oriented assets in the United States.
797468_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	In 2014, Occidental spent a much larger portion of its investment capital on the development of this portfolio.
797468_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Acquisitions in 2014 were approximately $1.6 billion, and comprised mainly of Permian Basin properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	This acquisition activity reflects Occidental's strategy to capitalize on the opportunities presented by its existing portfolio of assets and strong balance sheet.
797468_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the Permian Basin and focused international projects in the Middle East.
797468_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Chemical The primary objective of OxyChem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC.
797468_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	In early 2014, OxyChem completed construction and began operating a 182,500 ton-per-year membrane chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee and, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	and is expected to begin operating in 2017.
797468_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	In the third quarter, OxyChem completed construction and began operating a 162,000 tons per year hydrochloric acid synthesis unit at its existing Niagara Falls, N.Y. facility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Midstream and Marketing The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	In order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other Occidental segments as well as third parties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	The segment invests in and operates gas plants, co-generation facilities, pipeline systems and storage facilities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses, while limiting credit risk exposure.
797468_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	During 2014, Occidental sold its interest in BridgeTex Pipeline while retaining access to United States gulf markets through the pipeline, resulting in a $633 million pre-tax gain.
797468_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The BridgeTex Pipeline transports crude oil between the Permian region and the United States gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Simultaneously with the sale of Occidental's interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline, Occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in Plains Pipeline, resulting in a $1.4 billion pre-tax gain.
797468_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Health, environmental, safety and process metrics.
797468_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	In 2014, Occidental decreased its debt balance by $101 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The debt-to-capitalization (debt and equity) ratio was 16 percent and 14 percent as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
797468_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short- and intermediate-term financial performance.
797468_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2014 and 2013 :
797468_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2014 and 2013 :
797468_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Average worldwide realized oil prices fell $8.68, or 9 percent, in 2014 compared to 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Approximately half of Occidental s oil production tracks world oil prices, such as Brent, and half tracks WTI.
797468_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2014 increased 23 percent from 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014, settling at $53.27 per barrel and $57.33 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes settled at $98.42 per barrel and $110.80 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operations Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.
797468_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Of the total 4.5 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 87 percent is leased, 12 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Production-Sharing Contracts (PSC) Occidental has interests that are operated under PSCs or similar contracts in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar and Yemen.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following chart shows Occidental s total volumes for the last five years:
797468_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in 2011 and California Resources which was separated on November 30, 2014 into a separate publicly traded company.
797468_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Both operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for all applicable periods.
797468_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Includes average daily production of 5MBOE for 2010 related to a noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary.
797468_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Permian Basin Occidental's Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 13 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities and Permian EOR (enhanced oil recovery), which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as; CO 2 floods and waterfloods.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	During 2014, capital efficiency efforts reduced drilling costs per well by 8 percent for the Permian Basin operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	In addition, management began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program to take advantage of shale and other unconventional opportunities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	In the Permian Basin, Occidental spent over $2.6 billion of capital in 2014 with 73 percent spent on Permian Resources assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	In 2015, Permian Basin capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S5	Approximately 78 percent of the total capital to be spent in the Permian Basin is planned for Permian Resources assets to focus on growing oil production.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S6	Occidental's Permian Resources operations are among its fastest-growing assets and held approximately 2.5 million net acres at the end of 2014, including acreage with prospective resource potential.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S7	The development program, largely began in 2010, continued to increase in 2014, accounting for 280 wells drilled.
797468_15_ITEM7_P36_S8	In 2014, Permian Resources drilled 167 horizontal wells and expects to drill the same number of horizontal wells in 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Permian Resources has a sizeable inventory of wells to develop with economic returns in a low price environment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Continued completion optimization, the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, combined with expected commercial savings is expected to increase the well inventory even further.
797468_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Production from this business unit comes from approximately 13,000 gross wells, of which 61 percent are operated by other producers.
797468_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	this represents approximately 5,500 wells, of which only 22 percent are operated by others.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Permian EOR operates a combination of CO 2 floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Due to a unique combination of characteristics, the Permian Basin has been a leader in the implementation of CO 2 enhanced oil recovery projects.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Permian Basin s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO 2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO 2 supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	With over 30 active floods and 40 years of experience, Permian EOR is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO 2 flooding.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	Numerous projects have demonstrated that CO 2 injection can increase the recovery from Permian Basin reservoirs by more than 25 percent.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	Significant opportunity remains to expand Occidental's existing projects into new portions of reservoirs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S6	Occidental operates reservoirs that thus far have only been water flooded, leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new CO 2 injection.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S7	Hence, even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P40_S8	Technology improvements, such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Over the last few years, Occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells, with 109 wells deepened in 2014 and 81 wells planned in 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Occidental utilizes work-over rigs to drill the extra depth into additional CO 2 floodable sections of the reservoir.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	These are low cost projects which can add reserves even in a low price environment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	The current strategy for Permian EOR is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production thereby providing cash flow after capital to support growth in Permian Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	By exploiting natural synergies between Permian EOR and Permian Resources, Occidental is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P41_S6	Occidental's share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 222,000 BOE per day in 2014 with 75,000 BOE per day coming from Permian Resources and 147,000 BOE per day from Permian EOR.
797468_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Midcontinent and Other In April 2014, Occidental sold its Hugoton Field operations in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado for $1.3 billion and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $531 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The remaining Midcontinent and Other properties include interests in the Williston Basin, the Piceance Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale and other areas in South Texas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	These properties are located in North Dakota, Colorado, and Texas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	the Piceance area and 174,000 net acres in South Texas, including 4,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale.
797468_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	In Midcontinent and Other, excluding Hugoton Field operations, Occidental drilled approximately 99 wells and produced approximately 90,000 BOE per day in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other Developments During the fourth quarter of 2014, commodity prices declined significantly causing Occidental to assess the carrying value of its domestic producing assets and assess development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $2.7 billion in the Williston Basin, $904 million related to its gas and NGLs assets and $589 million for other domestic acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	In the second quarter of 2014, Occidental also recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $471 million for certain non-producing domestic acreage that management decided not to pursue.
797468_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Any further sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future.
797468_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Bahrain In 2009, Occidental and other consortium members began operating the Bahrain Field under a 20-year development and production sharing agreement (DPSA).
797468_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	Occidental has a 48-percent working interest in the joint venture.
797468_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	Since handover of operations, the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity 50 percent from an initial level of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26,000 barrels per day to more than 44,000 barrels per day.
797468_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Occidental's share of production from Bahrain during 2014 was approximately 236 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day and 4,000 barrels of oil per day.
797468_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Occidental has been pursuing opportunities to adjust terms of the DPSA to more accurately reflect current operating and economic challenges under the contract.
797468_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, Occidental has not yet been successful in obtaining these concessions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Due to deteriorating market conditions, Occidental has recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $801 million for its investments in Bahrain.
797468_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Iraq In 2010, Occidental and other consortium members signed a 20-year contract with the South Oil Company of Iraq to develop the Zubair Field.
797468_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	In 2013, the terms were improved reflecting a reduction in the targeted production level to 850,000 BOE per day and a five-year extension to 2035.
797468_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Occidental's interest in this contract entitles Occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee.
797468_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Delays in implementation of development plans have limited the amount of production from Iraq.
797468_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Occidental does not know when development activities will reach desired levels.
797468_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Occidental's share of production from Iraq was approximately 13,000 BOE per day in 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Libya Occidental participates with the Libyan National Oil Company in the Sirte Basin producing operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	In 2014, Occidental suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in the country.
797468_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Production disruptions continued throughout 2014 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures.
797468_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	Occidental does not know when operations will return to normal levels.
797468_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	The 2014 production volumes were insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Oman In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each block; Block 53, with a 45-percent working interest; and Block 62, with a 48-percent working interest.
797468_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The term for Block 9 continues through December 2015, with a 10-year extension right for certain areas, subject to government approval.
797468_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The term for Block 27 expires in 2035.
797468_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	A 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) was signed with the Government of Oman in 2005, pursuant to which Occidental assumed operation of the field.
797468_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	By the end of 2014 , Occidental had drilled more than 2,400 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project.
797468_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	In 2014 , the average gross daily production was 122,000 BOE per day, which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in September 2005 when Occidental assumed operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	In 2008, Occidental was awarded a 20-year contract for Block 62, subject to declaration of commerciality, where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	In 2014, Occidental signed a five year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area (natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir) for Block 62.
797468_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Occidental's share of production from Oman was approximately 76,000 BOE per day in 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Qatar In Qatar, Occidental is the operator at Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest.
797468_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	The terms for ISND, ISSD and Block 12 expire in 2019, 2022 and 2017, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2014, Occidental continued to develop the ISND field to improve ultimate recovery in all existing contract reservoirs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Occidental's share of production from Qatar was approximately 107,000 BOE per day in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	United Arab Emirates In 2011, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the Al Hosn gas project, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement.
797468_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Once fully operational, the project is anticipated to produce over 450 MMcf per day of natural gas and 75,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate, of which Occidental s net share would be over 180 MMcf per day and 30,000 barrels per day, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Initial start up of production from this project commenced in January 2015 and is proceeding as planned.
797468_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Additionally, the Al Hosn gas project includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in "Midstream and Marketing Segment - Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities".
797468_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Yemen In Yemen, Occidental owns interests in Block 10 East Shabwa Field, which extends through December 2015 with a 40.4-percent interest that includes an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, and Block S-1 An Nagyah Field, which is an Occidental-operated block with a 75-percent working interest that extends into 2023.
797468_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Given the political instability and civil unrest in Yemen, production levels may be unpredictable for the remainder of the Block 10 contract term and it is unlikely the contract will be extended.
797468_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Occidental's share of production from the Yemen properties was approximately 10,000 BOE per day in 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Bolivia Occidental holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Occidental's share of production from Bolivia was 2,000 BOE per day in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Colombia Occidental has a working interest in the La Cira-Infantas area and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	Occidental's share of production was approximately 27,000 BOE per day in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Oil, NGLs and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	For the 2014, 2013 and 2012 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $94.99, $96.94 and $94.71 per barrel, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	The calculated average Brent oil prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 disclosures were $99.51, 108.76, and $111.70 per barrel, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S4	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $4.42, $3.65 and $2.79 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S5	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2014 of 2,819 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2013 amount of 2,738 million BOE.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S6	Proved reserves at year-end 2014 and 2013 consisted of, respectively, 63 percent and 59 percent oil, 13 percent and 12 percent NGLs and 24 percent and 29 percent natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P61_S7	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 71 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Proved Reserve Additions Occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 380 million BOE in 2014 , and included 337 million BOE from Occidental's development program net of revisions of prior estimates, and 43 million BOE from purchases.
797468_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The total additions were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Many of these factors are outside management s control, and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels.
797468_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Occidental's 2014 development program provided approximately 265 million BOE of reserve additions domestically.
797468_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	In 2014, Occidental added proved reserves of 354 million BOE from improved recovery through its EOR and infill drilling activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Generally, the improved recovery additions in 2014 were mostly associated with the continued development of properties in the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO 2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects.
797468_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The use of either CO 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO 2 or steam and other economic factors.
797468_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells.
797468_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	In 2014 , extensions and discoveries added 41 million BOE related primarily to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves from the Permian Basin and Oman.
797468_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Purchases of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2014 , Occidental added 43 million BOE through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of domestic acquisitions mainly in the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	For example, higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	Offsetting this effect, higher prices decrease Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because less oil is required to recover costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	Conversely, when prices drop, Occidental's share of proved reserves increases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	In 2014, revisions of previous estimates provided a decrease of 58 million BOE to proved reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	Occidental had positive technical revisions of 7 million BOE which exclude the impact of negative revisions in Bahrain of 54 million BOE and price revisions of 11 million BOE.
797468_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2014, Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 328 million BOE from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Of the total additions, 284 million BOE represented additions from improved recovery, primarily in the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Occidental added 15 million BOE through domestic acquisitions, mainly in the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Additionally, the proved undeveloped reserves increased 29 million BOE due to extensions and discoveries mainly in Oman and the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 315 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2014 development programs including 214 million BOE from Al Hosn gas project reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P74_S5	Occidental incurred approximately $1.7 billion in 2014 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	A substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 was the result of the development program in the Permian Basin, which represents 55 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Recent global economic conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly.
797468_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	Prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Reserves Evaluation and Review Process Occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2014, were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.

797468_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	He is also an active member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training (JCORET).
797468_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	In 2014, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2014, in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards.
797468_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2014 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	In 2014, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 24 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 72 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014, settling at $53.27 per barrel and $57.33 per barrel from $98.42 per barrel and $110.80 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	The modest pace of United States economic growth resulted in slightly higher demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks.
797468_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	Chlorovinyl margins were challenged throughout the year as unprecedented unplanned and planned ethylene cracker outages significantly affected the supply of ethylene resulting in historically high ethylene prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments in 2014 and the gain on sale of the investment in Carbocloro in 2013, decreased in 2014, primarily due to higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chlor-alkali pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals.
797468_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2014, the United States economy continued its slow recovery with full-year growth expected to show only a slight improvement from the prior year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The improvement to the economy contributed to moderate improvements in domestic chemical demand.
797468_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	with 2013 at approximately 84 percent, which resulted in chlorine prices ending approximately 6 percent below where they began.
797468_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were competitive for the first half of 2014 but were negatively impacted by a significant increase in ethylene prices as third quarter supply was restricted by historically high ethylene cracker plant outages.
797468_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	Liquid caustic soda prices experienced downward price pressure during the first quarter as the industry absorbed the additional chlor-alkali capacity that came on-line.
797468_15_ITEM7_P96_S3	Export demand and pricing remains under pressure due to global over capacity and lower growth in major consuming regions such as Latin American and Asia.
797468_15_ITEM7_P96_S4	Businesses such as calcium chloride, potassium hydroxide and muriatic acid improved compared to 2013 as domestic demand improved and margins remained stable throughout the year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Vinyls Domestic PVC demand in 2014 grew by approximately 3 percent compared to 2013 as the housing and commercial construction markets continued their recovery.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Despite the improvement in the domestic market, the industry operating rate decreased by slightly more than 2 percent due to a combination of industry outages early in 2014 and export demand declining by approximately 10 percent compared to the prior year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Industry margins improved in 2014 due to first quarter PVC price increases, which were partially offset by higher ethylene prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	During the first half of 2014, North America ethane-based ethylene production continued to be price advantaged over Europe and Asia, but is reaching parity with the rest of the world as the price of oil declines.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	Despite the year-over-year reduction in North American exports of PVC, export volumes represented nearly 30 percent of total PVC sales of North American producers.
797468_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	Construction commenced on the Ingleside, Texas, ethylene cracker during the first half of 2014 and commercial operations are expected to begin in early 2017.
797468_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Long-term weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental s products that are consumed exclusively by industry participants.
797468_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Basic Chemicals Occidental expects that if the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve, domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	Overall, the increase in chlor-alkali capacity may restrict significant price improvement but anticipated higher demand from strengthening global markets coupled with lower natural gas prices should allow for moderate chlorine and caustic soda margin improvement in 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	natural gas and ethylene, remaining favorable compared to other feedstock costs in global markets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Vinyls North American demand and operating rates should improve in 2015 if growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues.
797468_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Occidental expects U.S. export demand to increase in 2015 and margins to improve over 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing, transportation and power generation assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	The marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market Occidental's and third-party volumes, trade commodities and engage in storage activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014 , excluding the gains from the sales of the BridgeTex Pipeline and a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline, were greater than 2013, reflecting higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses, partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Business Review Marketing and Trading The marketing and trading group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, trades around its assets, including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity, and engages in commodities trading.
797468_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Marketing performance in 2014 declined compared to 2013 due to lower margins on crude oil and NGLs, partially offset by higher margins in natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	In the second half of 2014, Occidental commenced winding down its Phibro commodity trading operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	As of year-end there was no material exposure related to Phibro s remaining activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	Occidental s 2014 earnings from these operations increased compared to 2013 , due to the multiple plant turnarounds in the Permian Basin operations during 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Occidental, together with ADNOC, completed the Al Hosn gas processing facilities in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Al Hosn gas processing facilities are designed to process 1.0 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, NGLs and sulfur.
797468_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Al Hosn gas processing facilities includes processing and treatment facilities, sulfur recovery units, including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur.
797468_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	The project is anticipated to produce approximately 8,700 tons per day of sulfur, of which Occidental's share would be 3,500 tons of sulfur per day.
797468_15_ITEM7_P109_S4	The Al Hosn gas processing facilities will generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur.
797468_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Pipeline Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy.
797468_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 Bcf per day.
797468_15_ITEM7_P111_S3	Dolphin Pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity.
797468_15_ITEM7_P111_S4	Occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the Dolphin Pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows.
797468_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,900 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 6.0 million barrels of active storage capability and 108 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	During 2014, Occidental sold its interest in BridgeTex Pipeline while retaining access to United States gulf markets through the pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	The BridgeTex Pipeline transports crude oil between the Permian region and the United States gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	Simultaneously with the sale of Occidental's interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline, Occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	Following the fourth quarter 2014 sale of a portion of its investment, Occidental owns approximately 13 percent of Plains Pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S4	The Plains Pipeline investment contributed approximately 19 percent of the segment's earnings for 2014, excluding the gain from the sale.
797468_15_ITEM7_P113_S5	Occidental's 2014 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2013 due to lower income from its investment in Plains Pipeline as a result of Occidental's lower ownership interest.
797468_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and the increase in earnings in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to higher margins from higher spark spreads and production.
797468_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGLs prices, which cannot reasonably be predicted.
797468_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	Generally, higher NGLs prices result in higher profitability.
797468_15_ITEM7_P115_S3	Although the marketing and trading business in isolation can be volatile in periods of severe price swings, Occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole given Occidental's framework of controls and risk management.
797468_15_ITEM7_P115_S4	Occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders.
797468_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	The statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
797468_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	(b) The 2014 amount includes a net $5.3 billion of pre-tax charges related to the impairments of domestic and international assets, other charges and the sale of Hugoton assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	The 2013 amount includes $607 million of pre-tax charges related to the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S3	The 2012 amount includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S4	(c) The 2014 amount includes $149 million pre-tax charges related to impairments of chemical assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S5	The 2013 amount includes a $131 million pre-tax gain from the sale of an investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian chemical facility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S6	(d) The 2014 amount includes a $633 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Occidental's interest in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, and a $1.4 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of an investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P119_S7	The 2013 amount includes a $1.0 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline and other items.
797468_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	(e) Represents amounts attributable to common stock after deducting a non controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	The non controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings.
797468_15_ITEM7_P120_S2	(f) The 2014 amount includes an $805 million pre-tax charge related to the impairment of the Joslyn oil sands project and a $553 million charge related to an other than temporary loss for retained shares of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P120_S3	The 2013 amount includes a $55 million pre-tax charge for the estimated cost related to the employment and post-employment benefits for Occidental's former Executive Chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	Oil and gas segment earnings in 2014 included pre-tax charges of $5.3 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of Hugoton assets and earnings in 2013 included pre-tax charges of $0.6 billion for the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	In 2012, oil and gas segment earnings included pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	Domestic oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairment and other charges in both years, were $1.9 billion in 2014 compared to $2.5 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	The decrease in domestic earnings reflected lower crude oil and NGLs prices, higher operating costs from increased workover and maintenance activities, and higher DD A expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and improved realized prices for gas.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	International oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairments, were $4.0 billion in 2014 and $4.6 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S3	International earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses and DD A. Average production costs for 2014, excluding taxes other than on income, were $13.50 per BOE, compared to $12.56 per BOE for 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S4	The increase in average costs reflects increased domestic activity in downhole maintenance and higher costs for purchased injectants.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S5	Average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding Hugoton production, were flat at 591,000 BOE in 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S6	Average domestic daily production increased by 10,000 BOE to 312,000 BOE in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S7	During this same time period, domestic daily oil production increased by over 6 percent or 11,000 barrels per day to 181,000 barrels, mainly coming from Permian Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S8	International average daily production volumes decreased to 279,000 BOE in 2014 from 289,000 BOE in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P125_S9	The decrease was primarily due to lower cost recovery barrels in Iraq and insurgent activities in Colombia, Libya and Yemen.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	Total company average daily sales volumes, excluding Hugoton, were 592,000 BOE in 2014 and 590,000 BOE in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	Domestic oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairments in both years, were $2.5 billion in 2013 compared to $2.2 billion in 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	The increase in domestic earnings reflected higher crude oil and gas prices, higher crude oil volumes and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher DD A expense.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S3	International segment earnings were $4.6 billion in 2013 and $5.5 billion in 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S4	The decrease in international earnings reflected lower crude oil prices and volumes as well as higher operating costs and DD A rates in the Middle East/North Africa.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S5	Average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding Hugoton, were 591,000 BOE for 2013, compared to 599,000 BOE for 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S6	Occidental's 2013 average daily domestic oil and NGLs production increased by 8,000 BOE or 5 percent and 1,000 BOE, respectively, as compared to 2012 while gas production decreased by 30 MMcf or 6 percent as Occidental focused its development program on oil production.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S7	International average daily production volumes decreased to 289,000 BOE in 2013 compared to 301,000 BOE in 2012, primarily from lower cost recovery barrels from Dolphin and Oman and higher levels of insurgent activities in Libya.
797468_15_ITEM7_P126_S8	Average daily sales volumes, excluding Hugoton, were 590,000 BOE in 2013, compared to 598,000 BOE in 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments of $149 million in 2014 and gain on sale of $131 million from the sale of the Carbocloro investment, were $569 million in 2014 compared to $612 million in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	The lower earnings in 2014 were primarily a result of lower caustic soda pricing driven by new chlor-alkali capacity in the industry and higher energy and ethylene costs, partially offset by higher PVC margins and improved volumes across most product lines.
797468_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	Chemical segment earnings were $612 million in 2013 , excluding the $131 million gain on sale of Carbocloro investment, compared to $720 million in 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P127_S3	The year-over-year change in chemical segment earnings reflected higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chlor-alkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals and reduced export demand.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014 , excluding impairments and other items and gains on sales of $2.0 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013, were $549 million in 2014, compared to $537 million in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	The increase in earnings reflected higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses, partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013 were $537 million, excluding the $1.0 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in Plains Pipeline and other items, compared to $396 million in 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S3	The 2013 results reflected higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S4	Marketing performance improved by $110 million, mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the United States gulf coast refineries.
797468_15_ITEM7_P128_S5	These improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to the plant turnarounds in the Permian Basin operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
797468_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion, were $2.9 billion at December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $110 million is included in other current assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	(a) Represents amounts attributable to income from continuing operations after deducting a non controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	The non controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings.
797468_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	Occidental s 2014 worldwide tax rate was 109 percent, which was higher than 2013 mainly due to an other than temporary loss on Occidental s available for sale investment in California Resources stock and the oil and gas international asset impairments of $1.1 billion, neither of which had a tax benefit.
797468_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	To a lesser degree, foreign pre-tax income was proportionately higher in 2014, which is generally taxed at a higher rate than domestic pre-tax income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P133_S2	The 2013 worldwide tax rate was lower than 2012 due to proportionately higher domestic pre-tax income in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $140 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of continuing operations are discussed below:
797468_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	The decrease in net sales in 2014 , compared to 2013 , was mainly due to a significant decline in worldwide oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and to a lesser extent, decline in NGLs prices, partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and higher domestic natural gas prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	The increase in net sales in 2013 , compared to 2012 , was due to improved domestic oil and gas realized prices and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by lower international liquids volumes and oil prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent about 70 percent of the change in oil and gas segment income which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net income than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	The 2014 gains on sale included $1.4 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline, $633 million for the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and $531 million for the sale of Hugoton properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P136_S4	The 2013 gains on sale included $1.0 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and $131 million for the sale of the Carbocloro investment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment and increased domestic down hole maintenance activities and higher costs for purchased injectants in the oil and gas segment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	Cost of sales decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to lower oil and gas operating costs, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P137_S2	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P137_S3	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2013 due to higher compensation and employee-related costs, in particular higher equity compensation due to higher stock prices, as well as the charge related to the employment and post-employment benefits for Occidental's former Executive Chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	DD A increased in each year from 2012 to 2014 , generally due to higher DD A rates and, to a lesser extent, the changes in volumes in the oil and gas segment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	Asset impairments and related items in 2014 of $7.4 billion included $2.8 billion in the Williston basin, $904 million related to Occidental's gas and NGLs assets, $889 million for other domestic acreage and $1.1 billion primarily related to operations in Bahrain and other international operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	Asset impairments also include charges for Joslyn oil sands of $805 million and an other than temporary loss of $553 million for the available for sale investment in California Resources stock.
797468_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	Asset impairments and related items in 2013 of $621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	Asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in Midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired previously when gas prices were above $6 per Mcf.
797468_15_ITEM7_P140_S2	Taxes other than on income in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P140_S3	From 2013 to 2012 taxes other than on income increased primarily due to rising prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	Provision for income taxes decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by certain nondeductible charges which increased the effective rate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	Provision for income taxes increased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P141_S2	The lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pre-tax income in 2013, compared to 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P141_S3	Income from equity investments decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to Occidental s reduced ownership in the Plains Pipeline as portions of the investment were sold in fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P141_S4	The increase in equity income in 2013, compared to 2012, reflected higher earnings from Occidental s equity investments in pipelines.
797468_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
797468_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	The decline in trade receivables, net, was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014, compared to the end of 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P143_S2	The decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower storage inventories.
797468_15_ITEM7_P143_S3	The decrease in other current assets mainly reflected the spin-off of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	due to the sale of a portion of Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P144_S1	The retained interest in California Resources after the separation is recorded as an available for sale investment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P144_S2	The decrease in PP E, net, was due to the spin-off of California Resources, DD A and asset impairments, partially offset by capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	The decrease in accounts payable reflected the spin-off of California Resources and lower marketing payables as a result of lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with increased Permian development activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes reflected the spin-off of California Resources as a portion of the deferred tax liability was divested.
797468_15_ITEM7_P145_S2	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-other was primarily due to the reduction of asset retirement obligations as a result of the spin-off of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P145_S3	The decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of California Resources stock as a one-time stock dividend, the distribution of cash dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by 2014 net income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2014 , Occidental had approximately $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4 billion in restricted cash.
797468_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States, and Occidental believes the cash in foreign jurisdictions can be brought to the United States without paying significant taxes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.
797468_15_ITEM7_P147_S2	As a result of the tax-free status of the spin-off of California Resources, Occidental's use of restricted cash is limited to the payment of dividends, repayment of debt or share repurchases.
797468_15_ITEM7_P147_S3	To retain the tax-free status of the spin-off, the restricted cash must be used for one of these purposes within eighteen months from the date of distribution.
797468_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	In August 2014, Occidental entered into a new five-year, $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2014 Credit Facility) which replaced its previous $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2011 Credit Facility), which was scheduled to expire in October 2016.
797468_15_ITEM7_P148_S1	The 2014 Credit Facility has similar terms to the 2011 Credit Facility and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow under this facility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P148_S2	Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility or the 2011 Credit Facility during 2014 and no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	Occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	At this time, Occidental does not anticipate any need for such funding.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $1.3 billion in 2014 to $8.9 billion, compared to $10.2 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S1	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower oil prices in the second half of 2014, which on a year-over-year basis declined 8-percent domestically and 9-percent worldwide, and higher domestic operating expenses for increased workover activity and higher prices for purchased injectants.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S2	Also in 2014, Occidental paid higher income taxes, in part related to the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and the first half of 2014 sale of Hugoton assets, while 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S3	Working capital changes in receivables reflected higher collections in the first half of 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S4	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2013 increased $1.1 billion to $10.2 billion, from $9.1 billion in 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S5	The increase in operating cash flows was mainly from domestic operations driven by lower operating costs, which reflected our cost savings initiatives, higher realized prices for oil and gas of nearly 5 percent and 30 percent, respectively, and higher oil production volumes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S6	Also, cash flows from our foreign operations were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in the Middle East/North Africa.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S7	In addition, cash flows were impacted favorably due to the collection of a federal tax receivable which was booked in 2012 and other working capital changes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S8	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S9	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S10	The chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S11	Occidental booked significant non-cash adjustments to income as a result of lower product prices and management s strategic review.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S12	Asset impairments and related items were $7.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.7 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P151_S13	The 2014 impairments are the result of a thorough portfolio review which resulted in the reduction of carrying values for projects which have sub-par returns in the current price environment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	impairment was mainly for Midcontinent gas properties that were acquired when gas prices were over $6 Mcf.
797468_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	Occidental recorded gains from the sales of assets and equity investments of $2.5 billion in 2014 and $1.2 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P153_S1	Cash proceeds related to these gains are reported as investing activities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	Compared to $7.2 billion in 2013, Occidental's net capital expenditures for 2014 were $8.7 billion after netting of partner contributions for the BridgeTex pipeline, which is included in financing activities, and the Chemical joint venture.
797468_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	The increase in capital expenditures of $1.5 billion from 2013 to 2014 was due to increased development activity in the domestic oil and gas operations, primarily Permian Resources.
797468_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	The increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to higher spending for the Al Hosn gas project and BridgeTex pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P154_S3	Occidental s 2015 net capital spending is expected to be $5.8 billion, mainly allocated to Permian Resources and certain Middle East projects.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Occidental has minimized development activities in the Williston Basin, domestic gas properties and Bahrain, as these have sub-par returns in the current product price environment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	Oil and gas capital spending is expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	Compared to $7.8 billion in 2012, Occidental's net capital expenditures for 2013 were $7.2 billion, net of partner contributions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S3	The decrease in capital expenditures from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the $0.6 billion decrease in oil and gas expenditures, a majority of which was in domestic properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S4	This reduction reflected cost savings from Occidental's efficiency initiatives.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S5	The increase for the chemical segment was due to the continued construction of the Tennessee chlor-alkali facility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S6	The decrease in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to lower spending for the Al Hosn gas project, partially offset by increased spending for BridgeTex pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S7	Cash flows from other investing activities, net, increased to $2.7 billion in 2014 from $1.0 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P155_S8	The 2014 other investing activities, net, included proceeds of $1.3 billion for the sale of the Hugoton Field operations, $1.1 billion for the sale of the BridgeTex Pipeline and $1.7 billion for the sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in Plains Pipeline, which was partially offset by $1.7 billion of acquisitions, mainly in the Permian Basin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	investing activities, net included proceeds of $1.4 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and $0.3 billion for the sale of Chemical s investment in Carbocloro, which was partially offset by acquisitions of approximately $0.6 billion.
797468_15_ITEM7_P156_S1	The 2012 other investing activities, net included $2.0 billion in payments for the acquisition of businesses and assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P156_S2	Commitments at December 31, 2014 for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion, which will be due in 2015 and beyond.
797468_15_ITEM7_P156_S3	Occidental expects to fund its commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	Cash used for financing activities in 2014 included special cash distributions received prior to the separation of California Resources of $6.1 billion, of which $4.95 billion was restricted cash.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	Approximately $0.9 billion of the restricted cash was used for share repurchases and the fourth quarter dividend payment, resulting in a $4.0 billion restricted cash balance as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	The 2014 net cash used by financing activities included $2.5 billion for purchases of treasury stock and $2.2 billion for dividend payments, which were partially offset by $0.4 billion for contributions received from a noncontrolling interest.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S3	A dividend payment was accelerated in 2012 which resulted in three dividend payments in 2013, whereas there were four cash dividend payments in 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S4	The 2013 net cash used by financing activities included $0.7 billion used to retire debt and $0.2 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S5	Common stock dividends paid decreased by $0.6 billion to $1.6 billion in 2013, due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that year's fourth quarter dividend.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S6	In addition, purchases of treasury stock increased from $0.6 billion in 2012 to over $0.9 billion in 2013.
797468_15_ITEM7_P157_S7	Higher 2013 net cash use compared to 2012 also reflected the net proceeds in 2012 of approximately $1.7 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes that year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of Occidental's off-balance-sheet arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	Guarantees Occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $336 million of Dolphin s debt.
797468_15_ITEM7_P160_S1	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	Occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit, indemnities and commitments.
797468_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	Marketing guarantees provided to third parties for California Resources total approximately $161 million as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	The fair value of the marketing guarantees and other obligations of California Resources guaranteed by Occidental were immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM7_P161_S3	See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Qatar" and Segment Results of Operations for further information about Dolphin.
797468_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_15_ITEM7_P162_S1	Occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility.
797468_15_ITEM7_P162_S2	Lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
797468_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	The table below summarizes and cross-references Occidental s contractual obligations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	This summary indicates on- and off-balance-sheet obligations as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	(b) Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, as well as certain accrued liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P164_S1	(c) Amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, CO 2, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_15_ITEM7_P164_S2	Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P164_S3	Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.14 percent discount rate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	Delivery Commitments Occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, gas and NGLs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P165_S1	The total amount contracted to be delivered, a substantial majority of which is in the United States, is approximately 430 million barrels of oil through 2025, 37 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 24 million barrels of NGLs through 2016.
797468_15_ITEM7_P165_S2	The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
797468_15_ITEM7_P165_S3	Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.
797468_15_ITEM7_P165_S4	None of the commitments in any given year is expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_15_ITEM7_P166_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_15_ITEM7_P166_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_15_ITEM7_P166_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	Occidental has entered into a written settlement agreement with the State of New Jersey (the State) to resolve claims asserted by the State against Occidental arising from Occidental s acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) and historic operations of DSCC s Lister Avenue Plant.
797468_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	In December 2014, the settlement was approved by the court.
797468_15_ITEM7_P167_S2	Under the settlement agreement (State Settlement) Occidental will pay the State $190 million and, under certain circumstances, perform or fund future work on behalf of the State along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	When Occidental acquired the stock of DSCC in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (Maxus), retained liability for the Lister Avenue Plant, which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, as well as other sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	Maxus is also obligated to indemnify Occidental for the State Settlement.
797468_15_ITEM7_P168_S2	Occidental is pursuing Maxus to recover the settlement costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P168_S3	The State Settlement does not cover any potential Occidental share of costs associated with the EPA s proposed clean-up plan of the Passaic River announced in April 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P168_S4	Maxus is also responsible for federal clean-up or other costs associated with the Lister Avenue Plant and the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site.
797468_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_15_ITEM7_P170_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P170_S3	Environmental matters are further discussed under the caption "Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" below.
797468_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_15_ITEM7_P171_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P172_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental's income taxes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_15_ITEM7_P173_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM7_P174_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_15_ITEM7_P174_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future.
797468_15_ITEM7_P175_S2	Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
797468_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and, regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 145 sites, excluding seven sites transferred to California Resources prior to December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 11 of the 145 sites described above, and 98 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a former refinery in Louisiana accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P179_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P179_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 67 third-party sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	remediation activities accounted for 56 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P180_S2	Four other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 63 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $380 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P182_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	Environmental Costs Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P185_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $160 million for 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_15_ITEM7_P186_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $15 billion, or approximately 27 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_15_ITEM7_P186_S2	Of such assets, approximately $13 billion are located in Middle East/North Africa and approximately $2 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_15_ITEM7_P186_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , net sales outside North America totaled $7.3 billion, or approximately 38 percent of total net sales.
797468_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_15_ITEM7_P187_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_15_ITEM7_P187_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_15_ITEM7_P187_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_15_ITEM7_P187_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_15_ITEM7_P188_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_15_ITEM7_P189_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P190_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P190_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P190_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_15_ITEM7_P190_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_15_ITEM7_P190_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_15_ITEM7_P191_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_15_ITEM7_P192_S0	exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_15_ITEM7_P193_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_15_ITEM7_P194_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_15_ITEM7_P194_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P195_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_15_ITEM7_P195_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S5	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S6	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S7	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S8	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S9	In 2014 , revisions of previous estimates caused a net 58 million BOE decrease in proved reserves, which amounted to approximately 2 percent of Occidental's total reserves as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S10	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P196_S11	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P197_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_15_ITEM7_P197_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_15_ITEM7_P198_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_15_ITEM7_P198_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P198_S2	The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P198_S3	For example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.70 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $155 million annually at current production rates.
797468_15_ITEM7_P198_S4	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $2.0 billion.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_15_ITEM7_P199_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_15_ITEM7_P200_S0	During its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2014, management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices, availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations.
797468_15_ITEM7_P200_S1	As a result, Occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.4 billion for the acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P200_S2	In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, Occidental recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $471 million for domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_15_ITEM7_P201_S0	Chemical Assets Occ idental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_15_ITEM7_P201_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S0	chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S1	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S2	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S3	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S4	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S5	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S6	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S7	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_15_ITEM7_P202_S8	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P203_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P203_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_15_ITEM7_P203_S2	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2015 is expected to be approximately $310 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P203_S3	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_15_ITEM7_P203_S4	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnin gs by approximately $50 million per year.
797468_15_ITEM7_P204_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_15_ITEM7_P205_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_15_ITEM7_P205_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_15_ITEM7_P206_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_15_ITEM7_P206_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P207_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_15_ITEM7_P208_S0	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012.
797468_15_ITEM7_P209_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_15_ITEM7_P210_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_15_ITEM7_P210_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P211_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_15_ITEM7_P212_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_15_ITEM7_P212_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_15_ITEM7_P213_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P213_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_15_ITEM7_P214_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P214_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_15_ITEM7_P214_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_15_ITEM7_P214_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_15_ITEM7_P215_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_15_ITEM7_P215_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_15_ITEM7_P216_S0	models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_15_ITEM7_P216_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_15_ITEM7_P217_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_15_ITEM7_P217_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_15_ITEM7_P218_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_15_ITEM7_P218_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S0	Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_15_ITEM7_P219_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_15_ITEM7_P220_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM7_P221_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_15_ITEM7_P221_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_15_ITEM7_P222_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_15_ITEM7_P223_S0	estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_15_ITEM7_P224_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_15_ITEM7_P224_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_15_ITEM7_P224_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_15_ITEM7_P224_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_15_ITEM7_P224_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_15_ITEM7_P225_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_15_ITEM7_P225_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $33 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P225_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $33 million.
797468_15_ITEM7_P226_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits.
797468_15_ITEM7_P226_S1	Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM7_P226_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_15_ITEM7_P226_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_15_ITEM7_P227_S0	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM7_P227_S1	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.
797468_15_ITEM7_P227_S2	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_15_ITEM7_P228_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES Listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes.
797468_15_ITEM7_P229_S0	In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules which eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary item.
797468_15_ITEM7_P229_S1	The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.
797468_15_ITEM7_P229_S2	The rules are not expected to have an impact on Occidental s financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM7_P230_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that grant their employees share-based payment awards in which the terms of the awards provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period.
797468_15_ITEM7_P230_S1	The new rules require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
797468_15_ITEM7_P230_S2	Entities may apply the update either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
797468_15_ITEM7_P230_S3	These rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.
797468_15_ITEM7_P230_S4	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued rules relating to revenue recognition.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S1	Under the new rules, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S2	The rules also require more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S3	These rules are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S4	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S5	In April 2014, the FASB issued rules changing the requirements for reporting discontinued operations so that only the disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S6	These rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7_P231_S7	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM7_P232_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued rules requiring net, rather than gross, presentation of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or other tax credit and any related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
797468_15_ITEM7_P232_S1	The rules became effective on January 1, 2014, and did not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P233_S0	SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 "Business and Properties," Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.
797468_15_ITEM7_P234_S0	Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "might," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "aim," "goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements.
797468_15_ITEM7_P234_S1	You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
797468_15_ITEM7_P234_S2	Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
797468_15_ITEM7_P235_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and elsewhere.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $126 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $27 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGLs prices.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $50 million.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	The marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil, gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P0_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $25 million.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	According to IHS Chemical, December 2014 average contract prices were: chlorine $233 per ton; caustic soda $590 per ton; and PVC $0.67 per lb.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a Risk Management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Members of the Risk Management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President of Operations also oversee these controls.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S4	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P5_S5	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Fair values for these contracts are derived principally from Level 1 and Level 2 sources.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Note : Includes cash-flow hedges further discussed below.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Derivative instruments used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes ended March 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental did not have any cash-flow hedges on stored volumes of natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P8_S3	At December 31, 2013 , Occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 13 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95-percent level of confidence.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Additionally, Occidental uses trading limits, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P9_S3	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $19 million.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Credit Risk Occidental's credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Occidental s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	A majority of Occidental s derivative transaction volumes are executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Occidental had a net liability of $4 million and $8 million, respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $3 million and $23 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P17_S7	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2014 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P18_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P18_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P18_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P18_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts.
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_15_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_15_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Occidental Petroleum Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_15_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 23, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

797468_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The midstream and marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and power.
797468_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	As a result of the spin-off of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) the statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
797468_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources for additional information.
797468_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	Revenues from the production of oil and gas properties in which Occidental has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Occidental s net revenue interest.
797468_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement.
797468_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Management believes that these estimates and judgments provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2014 , and net sales of approximately $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash is the result of the separation of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , there was $4.0 billion of cash restricted for the payment of dividends, payment of debt or share repurchases.
797468_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	Restricted cash must be used within 18 months of the date of distribution.
797468_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	A decline in market value of any available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	To determine whether an impairment is other than temporary, Occidental considers all available information relevant to the investment, including past events and current conditions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.
797468_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	INVENTORIES Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_15_ITEM8_P34_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	See Note 15 for further discussion of asset impairments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $2.0 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_15_ITEM8_P43_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_15_ITEM8_P44_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace, or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $361 million and $459 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_15_ITEM8_P54_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , Occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
797468_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_15_ITEM8_P58_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1,024 million and $1,283 million is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs) and capital employed incentive awards and return on assets (ROCEI/ROAI), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock and the estimated payout at the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	For total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from a Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	Compensation expense for RSUs, ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	Compensation expense for the dividends accrued on unvested awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria, if applicable.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S4	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_15_ITEM8_P70_S5	The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, which are more fully described in Note 13, in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $2.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately $610 million, $606 million and $524 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States.
797468_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	Interest paid totaled approximately $219 million, $238 million and $190 million, net of capitalized interest of $180 million, $137 million and $100 million, for the years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.
797468_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	In December 2014, Occidental spent $1.3 billion on an acquisition in the Permian Basin totaling approximately 100,000 net acres.
797468_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The assets acquired include primarily unproved oil and gas property leases and the related existing lease contracts, permits, licenses, easements, and equipment located on the properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	On November 30, 2014, the spin-off of California Resources was completed through the pro rata distribution of 81.3 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of California Resources to holders of Occidental common stock.
797468_15_ITEM8_P83_S3	See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	In November 2014, Occidental entered into an agreement with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (Plains Pipeline), and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to sell its interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC (BridgeTex), which owns the BridgeTex Pipeline.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The sale of Occidental's interest in BridgeTex includes two transactions: Plains Pipeline purchased Occidental's interest in BridgeTex for $1.075 billion, and Magellan acquired Occidental's interest in the southern leg of the BridgeTex Pipeline for $75 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	Occidental recognized a pre-tax gain of $633 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	Concurrent with the sale of its interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, Occidental sold a portion of Plains Pipeline for pre-tax proceeds of $1.7 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.4 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	In February 2014, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Hugoton Field operations in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado for pre-tax proceeds of $1.4 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S5	The transaction was completed in April 2014 and, after taking into account purchase price adjustments, it resulted in pre-tax proceeds of $1.3 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P84_S6	Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $531 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, Occidental paid approximately $0.5 billion to acquire certain domestic oil and gas properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	In October 2013, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	In addition, Occidental and Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V. (Mexichem) formed Ingleside Ethylene, LLC (Ingleside) to build and operate an ethane steam cracking unit capable of producing 1.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year (Cracker), which is expected to begin operating in 2017.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S3	With the ethylene produced from the Cracker, Occidental will produce vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), of which Mexichem has contracted to purchase a substantial majority.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S4	As of December 31, 2013, Occidental had invested approximately $23 million in Ingleside for its portion of construction costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S5	In May 2013, Occidental sold its investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian chemical facility.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S6	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $270 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $131 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S7	Dr. Ray Irani submitted his resignation as a director, effective as of May 15, 2013, and ceased serving as an executive of Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S8	In addition, certain other employees and several consulting arrangements were terminated during the second quarter.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S9	As a result of these developments and actions, Occidental recorded a $55 million pre-tax charge in the second quarter for the estimated costs of Dr. Irani's employment and post-employment benefits, and the termination of other employees and consulting arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S10	Dr. Irani and Occidental have settled all matters relating to his separation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S11	The cost of the settlement was consistent with the estimated charge recorded in the second quarter.
797468_15_ITEM8_P85_S12	Dr. Irani's employment terminated in December 2013.
797468_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, Occidental paid approximately $1.9 billion for domestic oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin, Williston Basin and South Texas.
797468_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	In November 2012, Occidental and Magellan formed BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC to construct the BridgeTex Pipeline, which began service in the second half of 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules which eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary item.
797468_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.
797468_15_ITEM8_P87_S2	The rules are not expected to have an impact on Occidental s financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that grant their employees share-based payment awards in which the terms of the awards provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The new rules require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
797468_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	Entities may apply the update either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
797468_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	These rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.
797468_15_ITEM8_P88_S4	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued rules relating to revenue recognition.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	Under the new rules, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S2	The rules also require more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S3	These rules are effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S4	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S5	In April 2014, the FASB issued rules changing the requirements for reporting discontinued operations so that only the disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S6	These rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P89_S7	The rules are not expected to have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued rules requiring net, rather than gross, presentation of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or other tax credit and any related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The rules became effective on January 1, 2014, and did not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $199 million and $205 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	Long-term debt consisted of the following:
797468_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2019.
797468_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_15_ITEM8_P93_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_15_ITEM8_P93_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.07 percent in 2014 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S3	In 2014, Occidental repurchased approximately $107 million of various senior notes due in 2022 and later.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S4	In December 2013, all $600 million of the outstanding 1.45-percent senior notes due 2013 matured.
797468_15_ITEM8_P94_S5	In addition, Occidental repurchased approximately $90 million of various senior notes due in 2021 and later.
797468_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	In June 2012, Occidental issued $1.75 billion of debt which comprised $1.25 billion of 2.70 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500 million of 1.50 -percent senior unsecured notes due 2018.
797468_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.74 billion .
797468_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	Interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August for each series of notes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $336 million and $354 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt.
797468_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit, indemnities and commitments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	Marketing guarantees provided to third parties for California Resources total approximately $161 million as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	The fair value of the marketing guarantees and other obligations of California Resources guaranteed by Occidental were immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	At December 31, 2014 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $6.9 billion, of which none is due in 2015 , $1.5 billion is due in 2016, $1.3 billion is due in 2017, $0.5 billion is due in 2018, $0.1 billion is due in 2019 and $3.5 billion is due in 2020 and thereafter.
797468_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $7.0 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $6.9 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses.
797468_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	At December 31, 2014 , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:
797468_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Rental expense for operating leases, net of sublease rental income for continuing operations, was $155 million in 2014 , $196 million in 2013 and $165 million in 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	Rental expense was net of sublease income of $4 million in 2014 , $3 million in 2013 and $4 million in 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	Derivative instruments used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes ended March 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental did not have any cash-flow hedges on stored volumes of natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM8_P104_S3	At December 31, 2013 , Occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 13 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas.
797468_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The following table presents the after-tax gains and losses recognized in, and reclassified to income from, AOCI, for derivative instruments classified as cash-flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
797468_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Occidental reclassified all of the outstanding balances as of 2013 net after-tax derivative losses from AOCI into net sales during 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	The amount of the ineffective portion of cash-flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table summarizes Occidental's net volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative contracts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
797468_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	The volumes in the table above exclude contracts tied to index prices, for which the fair value, if any, is minimal at any point in time.
797468_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	These contracts do not expose Occidental to price risk because the contract prices fluctuate with index prices.
797468_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	Occidental fulfills its short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.
797468_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	Subsequent to December 31, 2014, Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial portion of the outstanding positions at year-end and has sufficient production capacity and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P108_S4	Approximately $71 million net loss and $11 million net gain from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	(b) As of December 31, 2014, collateral received of zero has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $8 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	(c) As of December 31, 2013, collateral received of $11 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $46 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	(d) Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S4	Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $44 million and $103 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, deposited by Occidental, has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables.
797468_15_ITEM8_P109_S5	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	See Note 15 for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives.
797468_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Credit Risk A majority of Occidental s derivative transaction volumes are executed through exchange-traded contracts, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers.
797468_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	Occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the OTC market.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	Occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S3	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Occidental had a net liability of $4 million and $8 million, respectively, which are net of collateral posted of $3 million and $23 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P112_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_15_ITEM8_P113_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P116_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	As of December 31, 2014, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 145 sites, excluding seven sites transferred to California Resources prior to December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($79 million in 2014, $78 million in 2013 and $80 million in 2012) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ($255 million in 2014, $252 million in 2013 and $264 million in 2012).
797468_15_ITEM8_P117_S3	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 11 of the 145 sites described above, and 98 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	As of December 31, 2014, two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a former refinery in Louisiana accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S2	In connection with a 1986 acquisition, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S3	As of December 31, 2014, Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 67 third-party sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S4	Four of the remaining 59 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a containment and removal project in Tennessee, a former chemical plant in Ohio and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 56 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S5	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and New York and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P118_S6	Four other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee and Delaware and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 63 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $380 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_15_ITEM8_P124_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_15_ITEM8_P124_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	Occidental has entered into a written settlement agreement with the State of New Jersey (the State) to resolve claims asserted by the State against Occidental arising from Occidental s acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) and historic operations of DSCC s Lister Avenue Plant.
797468_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	In December 2014, the settlement was approved by the court.
797468_15_ITEM8_P125_S2	Under the settlement agreement (State Settlement) Occidental will pay the State $190 million and, under certain circumstances, perform or fund future work on behalf of the State along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	When Occidental acquired the stock of DSCC in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (Maxus), retained liability for the Lister Avenue Plant, which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, as well as other sites.
797468_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	Maxus is also obligated to indemnify Occidental for the State of New Jersey settlement.
797468_15_ITEM8_P126_S2	Occidental is pursuing Maxus to recover the settlement costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P126_S3	The State Settlement does not cover any potential Occidental share of costs associated with the EPA s proposed clean-up plan of the Passaic River announced in April 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P126_S4	Maxus is also responsible for federal clean-up or other costs associated with the Lister Avenue Plant and the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site.
797468_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_15_ITEM8_P127_S1	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_15_ITEM8_P127_S2	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P128_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P133_S2	At December 31, 2014 , total purchase obligations were $10 billion, which included approximately $3.3 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.5 billion that will be paid in 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P133_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2015 and thereafter, which were approximately $1.4 billion.
797468_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_15_ITEM8_P134_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	The current portion of total deferred tax assets was $110 million and $150 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which was reported in other current assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P139_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P139_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_15_ITEM8_P139_S3	The reduction in net deferred tax liabilities from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the spin-off of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM8_P139_S4	See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	Occidental had, as of December 31, 2014 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.8 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2024, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S2	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $9.9 billion, net of foreign taxes, at December 31, 2014 , as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S3	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $140 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S4	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $454 million, $550 million and $466 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S5	Additional paid-in capital was credited $4 million in 2014 , $6 million in 2013 and $8 million in 2012 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $61 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_15_ITEM8_P140_S7	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount.
797468_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P141_S2	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:
797468_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	TREASURY STOCK On October 2, 2014, Occidental increased the total number of shares authorized for its share repurchase program by 60 million shares to 185 million shares total; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_15_ITEM8_P144_S1	In 2014 and 2013 , respectively, Occidental purchased 25.8 million and 10.3 million shares under the program at an average cost of $93.40 and $94.42 per share, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P144_S2	Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during each year.
797468_15_ITEM8_P144_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , treasury stock shares numbered 120.0 million, 93.9 million and 83.3 million, respectiv ely.
797468_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.
797468_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	At December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.
797468_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax amounts:
797468_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	(a) See Note 13 for further information.
797468_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	Occidental has established several plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards including in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 17 million shares had been issued through December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	Of the remaining shares, only approximately 20 million shares are available for grants of future awards because a plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 20 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_15_ITEM8_P149_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	During 2014 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 28,283 shares of common stock.
797468_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	California Resources Spin-off Adjustments In connection with the separation of California Resources, Occidental entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with California Resources, which provided that employees of California Resources no longer participate in incentive programs sponsored or maintained by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P151_S1	Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, Occidental made certain adjustments, using volumetric weighted-average prices for the 4-day period immediately prior to and immediately following the separation, to the exercise price and number of share-based compensation awards, with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to the separation for all Occidental employees.
797468_15_ITEM8_P151_S2	These adjustments are summarized as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	Any unvested long-term incentive award units or shares, including Total Shareholder Return Incentives (TSRI), Return on Capital Employed Incentives (ROCEI), Return on Asset Incentives (ROAI), Restricted Stock Incentives (RSI), Long-Term Incentives (LTI) and Phantom Share Units (PHSU) were adjusted by multiplying the pre-spin number of units held by the quotient of the simple average of the volume weighted average price per share of Oxy stock for the four trading days immediately prior to and the four trading days immediate after the date of spin-off.
797468_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	Post-spin units were rounded up to the next whole number.
797468_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	For outstanding option awards, the strike price was adjusted (reduced) by the same quotient as described above.
797468_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	Performance periods, performance targets and vesting dates of Long-Term Incentive awards were not adjusted.
797468_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	Pursuant to the terms of all outstanding TSRI awards, the spin-off was treated as a dividend.
797468_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, or the number of potentially dilutive securities as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following table summarizes total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31:
797468_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	(a) Includes cash paid under the cash-settled portion of the SARs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	(b) As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards was $160 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P158_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	RSUs Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S2	These awards vest ratably over three years, or at the end of two or three years, following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S3	For certain three-year RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S4	For those awards that cliff vest in two or three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting period and are paid when they vest.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $100.95, $89.70, and $84.38 per share, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S6	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were $101.77, $90.35 and $84.81, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P159_S7	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented below:
797468_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	TSRIs Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of a three-year period following the grant date if performance targets are certified as being met.
797468_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	TSRIs granted in July 2014 and 2013 have payouts that range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award; TSRIs granted in 2012 have payouts that range from 0 to 100 percent of the maximum award.
797468_15_ITEM8_P160_S2	All outstanding TSRIs settle fully in stock once certified.
797468_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	Dividend equivalents for TSRIs are accumulated and paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_15_ITEM8_P164_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P164_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	A summary of Occidental s unvested TSRIs as of December 31, 2014 , and changes during the year ended December 31, 2014 , is presented below:
797468_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	(a) Presented at the target or mid-point payouts.
797468_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Options that are settled in stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
797468_15_ITEM8_P168_S1	Exercise prices of the Options and SARs were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P168_S2	Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years from the grant date with a maximum term of ten years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P168_S3	These Options and SARs may be forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.
797468_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	The fair value of each Option, stock-settled SAR or cash-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted-average life of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P169_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on US Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P170_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2014 :
797468_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	ROCEI / ROAI During 2014, Occidental also granted approximately 141,000 share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period beginning January 1, 2015, if performance targets based on return on assets of the applicable segment or return on capital employed are certified as being met.
797468_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	These awards are settled in stock at the time of vesting, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_15_ITEM8_P172_S2	Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon vesting for the number of vested shares.
797468_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, age, level and employee contributions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P174_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P174_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $163 million and $166 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $146 million in 2014 , $140 million in 2013 and $137 million in 2012 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 700 domestic and 1,300 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_15_ITEM8_P177_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_15_ITEM8_P177_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $215 million in 2014 , $229 million in 2013 and $218 million in 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	SPIN-OFF OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES In connection with the spin-off of California Resources, Occidental entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with California Resources, see Note 17, which provides that employees of California Resources no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Occidental as of the separation date.
797468_15_ITEM8_P178_S1	Upon separation, the Occidental pension and postretirement plans transferred assets and obligations to the California Resources plans resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $15 million and $72 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P178_S2	Additionally, as a result of the transfer of unrecognized losses to California Resources, deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income decreased $14 million and $36 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P179_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values:
797468_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans:
797468_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2015 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs:
797468_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $10 million and zero, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P183_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $29 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_15_ITEM8_P185_S0	(a) Plans requiring a salary increase assumption were separated with California Resources.
797468_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2014 and 2013.
797468_15_ITEM8_P186_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the use of a weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was not necessary as the retirement plans determining benefits using compensation were transferred in connection with the California Resources spin-off.
797468_15_ITEM8_P186_S2	At December 31, 2013, the weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was consistent with Occidental's past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation.
797468_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	The assumed long term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
797468_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	In 2014, Occidental adopted the Society of Actuaries 2014 Mortality Tables Report and Mortality Improvement Scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined benefit retirement plans in the United States use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor s pension obligations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	The updated mortality data reflects increasing life expectancies in the United States, and affected plans generally expect the value of the actuarial obligations to increase, depending on the specific demographic characteristics of the plan participants and the types of benefits.
797468_15_ITEM8_P188_S2	The changes in the mortality table results in an increase of $27 million and $98 million in the pension and postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 10 percent at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P189_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.5 percent to 10 percent in 2014 , depending on local economic conditions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 1.79 percent and 2.36 percent as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S1	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S2	For those union employees, Occidental projected that healthcare cost trend rates would decrease 0.25 percent per year from 7.75 percent in 2014 until they reach 5.0 percent in 2025, and remain at 5.0 percent thereafter.
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S3	A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed healthcare cost trend rates would result in an increase of $55 million or a reduction of $47 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S4	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P190_S5	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	The investments are monitored by Occidental s Pension and Retirement Trust and Investment Committee (Pension Committee) in its role as fiduciary.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S2	The Pension Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S3	Equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S4	Other asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S5	The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P191_S6	Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
797468_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	(a) This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries.
797468_15_ITEM8_P193_S1	(b) This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P193_S2	(c) This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries.
797468_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	The activity during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , for the assets using Level 3 fair value measurements was insignificant.
797468_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	Occidental expects to contribute $6 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during 2015 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENTS As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion of equity-method investments, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental s equity investments consisted mainly of a 13-percent interest in Plains Pipeline, a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, and various other partnerships and joint ventures.
797468_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	Equity investments paid dividends of $396 million, $447 million, and $526 million to Occidental in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P197_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since their respective acquisitions was immaterial.
797468_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $632 million, of which almost $546 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives.
797468_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments:
797468_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a 24.5 -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment.
797468_15_ITEM8_P200_S1	In November 2014 and October 2013, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, resulting in pre-tax gains of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESOURCES STOCK As part of Occidental's spin-off of its California oil and gas operations and related assets, Occidental retained an 18.7 percent interest in California Resources stock or approximately 71.5 million shares, which is recorded as an available for sale investment.
797468_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	As a result of a declining trading price, Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $553 million for this available for sale investment as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM8_P201_S2	At December 31, 2014, Occidental's available for sale investment in California Resources was $394 million.
797468_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	, Occidental purchases oil, NGLs, power, steam and chemicals from and sells oil, NGLs, gas, chemicals and power to certain of its equity investees and other related parties at market-related prices.
797468_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the following amounts due from or to its related parties:
797468_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	In 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , sales of Occidental-produced oil and NGLs to Plains Pipeline accounted for 46 percent, 72 percent and 80 percent of these totals, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	Additionally, Occidental conducts marketing and trading activities with Plains Pipeline for oil and NGLs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P203_S2	These transactions are reported in Occidental's income statement on a net margin basis.
797468_15_ITEM8_P203_S3	The sales amounts above include the net margins on such transactions, which were negligible.
797468_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	FAIR VALUES RECURRING The following tables provide fair value measurement information for assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis:
797468_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	FAIR VALUES NONRECURRING As a result of the sharp decline of the forward price curve in the fourth quarter of 2014, Occidental recognized approximately $3.8 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to proved oil and gas properties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P205_S1	Domestically, Occidental recognized $2.8 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to domestic oil and gas properties primarily in the Williston Basin and gas and NGLs assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P205_S2	Internationally, the remaining $1.0 billion related primarily to Bahrain.
797468_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows.
797468_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8 percent.
797468_15_ITEM8_P206_S2	These properties were impacted by persistently low natural gas prices and the recent decline in oil prices in the United States changing management's development plans.
797468_15_ITEM8_P206_S3	Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
797468_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	In 2014, Occidental recognized approximately $111 million pre-tax charges related to the impairments of Chemical assets.
797468_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	(a) Amount represents net book value at date of assessment.
797468_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and other on-balance sheet financial instruments, other than fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value.
797468_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	See Note 5 for the fair value of Long-term Debt.
797468_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	Occidental conducts its continuing operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing.
797468_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas.

797468_15_ITEM8_P212_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P212_S3	Earnings of industry segments and geographic areas exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P214_S1	Corporate assets consist of cash and restricted cash, certain corporate receivables and PP E, and an investment in the Joslyn, Canada oil sands project.

797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	The following tables set forth Occidental s net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of oil (including condensate), NGLs and natural gas and changes in such quantities.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S1	Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S2	Oil, NGLs and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S3	For the 2014, 2013 and 2012 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $94.99, $96.94 and $94.71 per barrel, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S4	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $4.42, $3.65 and $2.79 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S5	Reserves are stated net of applicable royalties.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S6	Estimated reserves include Occidental's economic interests under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other similar economic arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P228_S7	In addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.
797468_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	Lower crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities that can be produced economically, which may reduce Occidental's revenues, operating income and cash flows.
797468_15_ITEM8_P229_S1	Recent global economic conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly.
797468_15_ITEM8_P229_S2	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_15_ITEM8_P229_S3	Prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_15_ITEM8_P229_S4	All supplemental oil and gas information excludes California Resources for all periods presented.
797468_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	(a) A substantial majority of the proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM8_P230_S1	(b) Approximately 15 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2014 are nonproducing, primarily associated with the Al Hosn gas project in the United Arab Emirates.

797468_15_ITEM8_P232_S1	(b) Approximately 26 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2014 are nonproducing, primarily associated with the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_15_ITEM8_P232_S2	(c) A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with the Al Hosn gas project is expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.
797468_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P234_S2	For example, in 2014, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $93.00 per barrel and $4.34 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 20 to 1.
797468_15_ITEM8_P234_S3	(c) Approximately 20 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2014 are nonproducing, primarily associated with the Al Hosn gas project.
797468_15_ITEM8_P234_S4	(d) A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with the Al Hosn gas project is expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.
797468_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	CAPITALIZED COSTS Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated DD A were as follows:
797468_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	(a) Includes acquisition costs, development costs, capitalized interest and asset retirement obligations.
797468_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	COSTS INCURRED Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, were as follows:

797468_15_ITEM8_P239_S1	(b) Production costs are the costs incurred in lifting the oil and gas to the surface and include gathering, primary processing, field storage and insurance on proved properties, but do not include DD A, royalties, income taxes, interest, general and administrative and other expenses.
797468_15_ITEM8_P239_S2	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P241_S2	For example, in 2014, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $93.00 per barrel and $4.34 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 20 to 1.
797468_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	(b) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	For purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to Occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P243_S1	The realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P243_S2	Future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce proved reserves at year end.
797468_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	Future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows.
797468_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	The discount was computed by application of a 10-percent discount factor.
797468_15_ITEM8_P244_S2	The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P244_S3	Such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past.
797468_15_ITEM8_P244_S4	Other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results.
797468_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	The following table sets forth, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , Occidental s approximate average sales prices in continuing operations.

797468_15_ITEM8_P252_S3	(d) Acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves.
797468_15_ITEM8_P253_S0	Occidental s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases.
797468_15_ITEM8_P253_S1	Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.
797468_15_ITEM8_P253_S2	In some instances, Occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.
797468_15_ITEM8_P253_S3	In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions.
797468_15_ITEM8_P253_S4	Scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM8_P254_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM8_P254_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_15_ITEM8_P255_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_15_ITEM8_P255_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_15_ITEM8_P255_S2	For example, in 2014, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $93.00 per barrel and $4.34, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 20 to 1.
797468_15_ITEM8_P256_S0	Note : The amounts presented represent continuing operations.
797468_15_ITEM9_P0_S0	Occidental had no changes in, and no disagreements with, Occidental's accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2014 , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2014 , Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
797468_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based upon that evaluation, Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Occidental's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	There has been no change in Occidental's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Occidental's internal control over financial reporting.

797468_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on December 30, 2014 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the state of Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in the Middle East.
797468_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE.
797468_15_ITEM15_P59_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.
797468_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation by a person who is qualified by experience and training equivalent to that of a Reserves Auditor to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, [and] (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_15_ITEM15_P64_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_15_ITEM15_P64_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_15_ITEM15_P66_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2014; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2014 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_15_ITEM15_P72_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_15_ITEM15_P72_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	Approximately 23 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	The remaining 77 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.
797468_15_ITEM15_P73_S3	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Approximately 2 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.
797468_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The remaining 98 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Of the properties reviewed, approximately 94 percent of the proved producing reserves and 42 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques.
797468_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO 2 injection and infill drilling.
797468_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2014 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s average realized prices.
797468_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
797468_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	A summary of average realized prices are not included for properties located in the Middle East because of host government s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
797468_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
797468_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_15_ITEM15_P86_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_15_ITEM15_P86_S4	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_15_ITEM15_P88_S5	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2014, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
797468_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S4	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S5	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_15_ITEM15_P93_S6	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2014.
797468_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

797468_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
797468_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
797468_15_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
797468_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
797468_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
797468_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_15_ITEM15_P119_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_15_ITEM15_P119_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
797468_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
797468_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
797468_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
797468_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
797468_15_ITEM15_P122_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
797468_15_ITEM15_P122_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
797468_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
797468_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
797468_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
797468_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
797468_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
797468_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
797468_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
797468_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
797468_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
797468_15_ITEM15_P130_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
797468_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_15_ITEM15_P132_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
797468_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
797468_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
797468_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
797468_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
797468_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
797468_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
797468_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
797468_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
797468_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
797468_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
797468_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
797468_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
797468_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
797468_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
797468_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
797468_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
797468_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(2)] , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in weather patterns and climatic changes.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The impacts of the members of OPEC and other producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Generally, Occidental's practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products in the future.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Recent global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Continued reductions in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, share repurchases and impair the carrying value of assets.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Occidental's restructuring activities may affect its stock price.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Occidental has performed a strategic review of its operations, which has resulted in the restructuring and the separation or divestiture of various assets.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	This activity and further implementation of the strategic review may affect the market value of Occidental's common stock.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For example, Occidental may take different actions than expected, receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	New or amended laws and regulations, or interpretations of such laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use or increased use of land, water and other natural resources, safety, security and environmental protection, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental's costs or reduce demand for Occidental's products.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits and authorizations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates, and the variance may be material.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with SEC regulations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Concerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect Occidental s operations or results.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require Occidental to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for products that Occidental s businesses produce.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for products produced by Occidental s businesses.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental s business, financial condition and results of operations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	However, the certainty and timing of these potential effects are unknown.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes, other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Cyber attacks could significantly affect Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If, however, Occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures were compromised, the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
797468_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Occidental has not received any written comments from the SEC staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding December 31, 2015 and that remain unresolved.
797468_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent a notice to an OPC subsidiary that it is seeking penalties of $165,600 related to a crude oil pipeline incident in Scurry County, Texas.
797468_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The subsidiary contested the penalties and is awaiting a decision.

797468_16_ITEM4_P0_S0	The current term of office of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the April 29, 2016 meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_16_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 27,000 stockholders of record at January 31, 2016 , and by approximately 600,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividends declared on the common stock were $0.72 for the first quarter of 2015 and $0.75 for each quarter thereafter ($2.97 for the year).
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S4	On February 18, 2016 , a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2016 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2016 .
797468_16_ITEM5_P0_S5	The current annual dividend rate of $3.00 per share has increased by 500 percent since 2002.
797468_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS All of Occidental's stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans is approximately 35 million, of which approximately 1.7 million had been reserved for issuance through December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) Includes shares reserved to be issued pursuant to stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and performance-based awards.
797468_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	Shares for performance-based awards are included assuming maximum payout, but may be paid out at lesser amounts, or not at all, according to achievement of performance goals.
797468_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	(2) Price applies only to the Options and SARs included in column (a).
797468_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	Exercise price is not applicable to the other awards included in column (a).
797468_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	(3) A plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_16_ITEM5_P4_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than the amount shown depending on the type of award granted.
797468_16_ITEM5_P4_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the amount shown may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 , were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	(a) Includes purchases from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	(b) Represents the total number of shares remaining at year end under Occidental's share repurchase program of 185 million shares.
797468_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The program was initially announced in 2005.
797468_16_ITEM5_P7_S1	The program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500) and with that of Occidental s peer group over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM5_P8_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in: (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500, and (iii) each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the peer group, and that all dividends were reinvested.

797468_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
797468_16_ITEM6_P0_S2	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	A section of this report and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions and dispositions, discontinued operations and other items affecting comparability.
797468_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end total shares of common stock outstanding, net of shares held as treasury stock, by the year-end closing stock price.
797468_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	(c) The 2012 amount includes an accelerated fourth quarter dividend payment, which normally would have been accrued as of year-end 2012 and paid in the first quarter of 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	STRATEGY General Through its operations, Occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
797468_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet.
797468_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business, and in 2015, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices continued the downward trend started in the fourth quarter of 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In order to manage this risk, Occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and maintain a low debt to capitalization ratio, which allows Occidental access to capital markets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	In connection with Occidental's strategic review initiatives, Occidental:
797468_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Minimized or ceased its involvement in non-core operations in the Middle East and North Africa, including Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.
797468_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	As a result of exiting non-core operations, Occidental expects improved margins through lower cash operating costs, selling, general and administrative costs and reduced capital spending in the future.
797468_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The following describes the application of Occidental s overall strategy for each of its operating segments:
797468_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Oil and Gas The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy primarily by:
797468_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Maintaining a disciplined approach towards domestic acquisitions and divestitures and the execution of international contracts, with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental's existing positions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	In 2015, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $4.4 billion, and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the Permian Basin and the Middle East.
797468_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	This activity reflects Occidental's strategy to focus on achieving returns above the cost of capital even in a low price environment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Management believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the Permian Basin and Colombia and focused international projects in the Middle East.
797468_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Chemical The primary objective of OxyChem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
797468_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that U.S. shale gas development has presented to U.S. chemical producers by providing low-cost ethane as a raw material.
797468_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The construction of the ethylene cracker remains on budget and schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017.
797468_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	In 2015, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $594 million, approximately two-thirds of which was spent on the Mexichem joint venture.
797468_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	In the third quarter, OxyChem sold an idled facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Midstream and Marketing The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	In order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other Occidental segments as well as third parties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The segment invests and operates pipeline systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities, and storage facilities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses, while limiting credit risk exposure.
797468_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	In 2015, capital expenditures totaled $535 million of which a majority was related to the Al Hosn gas processing facilities, crude oil terminal and Permian Basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure.
797468_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Key Performance Indicators Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Segment specific measures such as per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development costs and reserves replacement percentages.
797468_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
797468_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s financial performance.
797468_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2015 and 2014 :
797468_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2015 and 2014 :
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 , closing at $37.04 per barrel and $37.28 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes were $53.27 per barrel and $57.33 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Average worldwide realized oil prices fell $43.03, or 48 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2015 decreased 46 percent from 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	Average WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined 48 percent and 46 percent, from $93.00 and $99.51 in 2014 to $48.80 and $53.64 in 2015, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	Average NYMEX natural gas prices declined 37 percent, from $4.34 in 2014 to $2.75 in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The decline in oil and gas prices during 2015, as well as the decision to sell or exit non-core assets caused Occidental to assess the carrying value of all of its oil and gas producing assets and assess development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	As a result, in 2015, Occidental recorded total pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion for its domestic assets and $5.0 billion for its international assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	To assess carrying value of its oil and gas assets, Occidental uses oil and gas price curves settled on the last trading day of each quarter.
797468_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Any further sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future.
797468_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operations 2015 Developments In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota for approximately $590 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Occidental's share of production for the Williston operations was approximately 16,000 BOE per day in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	In December 2015, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for approximately $155 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	The transaction is expected to close in March 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	The assets and liabilities of the Piceance operations are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Occidental has exited or significantly reduced its involvement in non-core operations in the Middle East and North Africa.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	In Iraq, Occidental has issued a notice of withdrawal and is working to reassign its interest in the Zubair Field in accordance with the contract terms.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	In Yemen, Occidental s non-operated interest in Block 10 East Shabwa Field expired in December 2015, and in February 2016, Occidental sold its interests in Block S-1, An Nagyah Field.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	In addition, Occidental has been reducing its activity and exposure in Bahrain and Libya.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	Occidental has suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in Libya, and production disruptions continued throughout 2015 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Less than 5 percent of the total capital spending in 2015 was allocated to these Middle East operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	Collectively, Occidental s share of production from these operations in the Middle East was 72,000 BOE per day in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.
797468_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Of the total 3.6 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 85 percent is leased, 14 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Production-Sharing Contracts Occidental's interests in Oman and Qatar are subject to production sharing contracts (PSC).
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P33_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following chart shows Occidental s total volumes for the last five years:
797468_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in 2011 and California Resources which was separated on November 30, 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Both operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for all applicable periods.
797468_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Permian Basin Occidental's Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 13 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities and Permian EOR (enhanced oil recovery), which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as CO 2 floods and waterfloods.
797468_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	During 2015 , focused on capital efficiency, the Permian operations reduced well drilling and completion costs by 33 percent per well.
797468_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	In the Permian Basin, Occidental spent over $2.7 billion of capital in 2015 , with 84 percent spent on Permian Resources assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	In 2016 , Occidental expects to allocate approximately 21 percent of the 2016 capital budget to Permian Resources, which will focus on areas in both the Midland and Delaware Basins where infrastructure currently exists to achieve higher returns, and approximately 17 percent to Permian EOR in order to add to existing facilities to increase CO 2 production and injection capacity for future projects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Occidental's Permian Resources operations are among its fastest growing assets with over 8,500 drilling locations in its horizontal inventory, a sizable portion of which can be developed in a low price environment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Continued completion optimization, the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, combined with projected commercial savings is expected to increase the well inventory even further.
797468_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The development program, largely began in 2010, continued to increase in 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	In 2015, Permian Resources drilled 231 wells, which included 195 horizontal wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Production from Permian Resources comes from approximately 13,200 gross wells, of which 62 percent are operated by other producers.
797468_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	On a net basis, this represents approximately 5,550 wells, of which only 23 percent are operated by others.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Permian EOR operates a combination of CO 2 floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Due to a unique combination of characteristics, the Permian Basin has been a leader in the implementation of CO 2 enhanced oil recovery projects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Permian Basin s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO 2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO 2 supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	With 31 active floods and 40 years of experience, Permian EOR is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO 2 flooding.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	Occidental is an industry leader in applying this technology, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent in the fields where it is employed.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	Significant opportunity remains to expand Occidental's existing projects into new portions of reservoirs that thus far have only been water flooded, leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new CO 2 injection.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S6	Hence, even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P40_S7	Technology improvements, such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Over the last few years, Occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells, with 95 wells deepened in 2015 and 67 wells planned for 2016 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional CO 2 floodable sections of the reservoir.
797468_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	These are low cost projects which can add reserves even in a low price environment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	has a large inventory of future CO 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The current strategy for Permian EOR is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production and provide cash flow.
797468_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	By exploiting natural synergies between Permian EOR and Permian Resources, Occidental is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Occidental's share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 255,000 BOE per day in 2015 with 110,000 BOE per day coming from Permian Resources and 145,000 BOE per day from Permian EOR.
797468_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	South Texas and Other Occidental holds approximately 174,000 net acres in South Texas, including 4,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale.
797468_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Oman In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 50-percent and 65-percent working interest in each block, respectively; Block 53, with a 45-percent working interest; and Block 62, with an 80-percent working interest.
797468_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	In December 2015, the existing production sharing contract for Block 9 expired and Occidental agreed to operate Block 9 under modified operating terms until a new contract is approved.
797468_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The term for Block 27 expires in 2035.
797468_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	A 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) was signed with the Government of Oman in 2005, pursuant to which Occidental assumed operation of the field.
797468_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	By the end of 2015, Occidental had drilled more than 2,600 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project.
797468_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	In 2015, the average gross daily production was 122,000 BOE per day, which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in September 2005 when Occidental assumed operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	targeting natural gas and condensate resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	In 2014, Occidental signed a five year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area (natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir) for Block 62.
797468_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Production commenced in Block 62 in January 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	Occidental's share of production from Oman was approximately 89,000 BOE per day in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Qatar In Qatar, Occidental is the operator at Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest.
797468_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The terms for ISND, ISSD and Block 12 expire in 2019, 2022 and 2017, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Occidental's share of production from Qatar was approximately 107,000 BOE per day in 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	United Arab Emirates In 2011, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the Al Hosn gas project, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement.
797468_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Al Hosn gas project became fully operational in 2015, and produced over 460 MMcf per day of natural gas and 74,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which Occidental s net share is 185 MMcf per day and 29,000 barrels per day, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	Additionally, the Al Hosn gas project includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in "Midstream and Marketing Segment - Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities".
797468_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East/North Africa oil and gas operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Colombia Occidental has working interests in the La Cira-Infantas and Teca areas and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Occidental's share of production was approximately 35,000 BOE per day in 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	Occidental also holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	Occidental's share of production from Bolivia was 2,000 BOE per day in 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	For the 2015 , 2014 and 2013 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $50.28, $94.99 and $96.94 per barrel, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	The calculated average Brent oil prices for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 disclosures were $55.57, $99.51 and $108.76, per barrel, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S4	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $2.66, $4.42 and $3.65 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S5	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2015 of 2,200 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2014 amount of 2,819 million BOE.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S6	Proved reserves at year-end 2015 and 2014 consisted of, respectively, 59 percent and 63 percent oil, 15 percent and 13 percent NGLs and 26 percent and 24 percent natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P53_S7	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 79 percent and 71 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2015 and 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Changes in Proved Reserves Occidental's total proved reserves decreased 166 million BOE in 2015 , which included additions of 149 million BOE from Occidental's development program, reduced by 315 million BOE comprised primarily of price and price related revisions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Changes in reserves before production and sales of proved reserves were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Many of these factors are outside management s control, and may negatively or positively affect Occidental's reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2015 , Occidental added proved reserves of 144 million BOE mainly associated with the Permian Basin and Oman operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO 2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The use of either CO 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO 2 or steam and other economic factors.
797468_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	In 2015 , extensions and discoveries added 5 million BOE related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in Oman.
797468_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Purchases of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental's share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	In 2015 , negative revisions of previous estimates of 315 million BOE were primarily price and price-related revisions associated with domestic assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2015 , Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 76 million BOE from improved recovery and extensions and discoveries.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Of the total additions, over 80 percent represented additions from improved recovery in the Permian Basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 106 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the 2015 development programs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	Permian Basin and Oman accounted for approximately 92 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	Proved undeveloped reserves were reduced by 332 million BOE primarily due to price and price-related revisions and the sale of Williston.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	Occidental incurred approximately $1.3 billion in 2015 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P64_S6	A substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 was the result of the development program in the Permian Basin, which represents 68 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Global oversupply continues to suppress oil and gas prices significantly.
797468_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	Prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	The Senior Vice President has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S4	He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S5	He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S6	He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Classification.
797468_16_ITEM7_P70_S7	He is also an active member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training (JCORET).
797468_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	In 2015 , Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2015 , in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards.
797468_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2015 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2015 , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 19 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined further in 2015 , closing at $37.04 per barrel and $37.28 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Commodity prices continued their decline in early 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	The WTI and Brent oil price indexes were $53.27 per barrel and $57.33 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P76_S4	Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Despite the continued modest pace of United States economic growth, demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks decreased slightly as the global economic slowdown broadened and the strength of the U.S. dollar hindered exports.
797468_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Vinyls margins improved during the second half of 2015 as the cost of feedstocks, primarily ethylene and natural gas, improved significantly from 2014 levels.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2015, the United States economy continued its slow recovery with full-year growth expected to be below the 2.4 percent growth rate experienced in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The lower U.S. growth rate was reflected in lower domestic demand as the industry chlorine operating rate decreased 1 percent to 83 percent from 84 percent in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	The slightly lower operating rate resulted in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were competitive for the balance of the year as ethylene costs decreased in line with falling energy costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	However, total derivative export volume was down versus 2014 as global demand softened particularly in Asia and Latin America.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S5	Liquid caustic soda prices experienced downward price pressure during the first three quarters of 2015 as the industry continued to absorb the additional chlor-alkali capacity that has come on line in the U.S. during the last 2 years.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S6	Domestic caustic soda prices rose in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the industry pushed to expand margins from historically depressed levels.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S7	Export demand and pricing remains under pressure due to global over capacity and lower growth in major consuming regions and the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted demand for U.S. products.
797468_16_ITEM7_P82_S8	Businesses such as calcium chloride and especially muriatic acid, were down due to substantially reduced oil and gas drilling activity and demand.
797468_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Vinyls Industry PVC margins improved slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 as record high spot ethylene costs declined sharply throughout the year and offset declines in PVC pricing.
797468_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	Year-over-year domestic PVC demand increased only 0.9 percent due to the slow start to 2015 housing construction following extended winter conditions as well as the slower pace of growth in single family home sales.
797468_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	decreased 2.5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The PVC industry operating rate in 2015 of 83.7 percent was 0.6 percent lower than 2014 largely due to increased industry capacity coming on-line.
797468_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	Export volume remained a significant portion of PVC sales representing 30 percent of total North American producer s production.
797468_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	The U.S. ethylene cost advantage of prior years has been reduced as world oil prices continued to decline in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	Construction on the ethylene cracker remains on budget and on schedule and the facility is expected to begin operating in early 2017.
797468_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Long-term weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental s products that are consumed by industry participants.
797468_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Basic Chemicals Occidental expects that if the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve, domestic demand for basic chemical products should be moderately higher in 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Overall, the low chlor-alkali operating rates driven by capacity increases may limit significant price improvement but expected demand coupled with low energy costs should allow the margin gains secured at the end of 2015 to remain in place.
797468_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remaining favorable compared to other feedstock costs in global markets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Vinyls North American demand and operating rates should improve in 2016 as growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues.
797468_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	Occidental expects U.S. export demand to improve modestly and for margins to be on par with 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing, transportation and power generation assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Pipeline Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 Bcf per day.
797468_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,900 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin of southwest Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 7.0 million barrels of active storage capability and 127 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Occidental's 2015 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2014 primarily due to lower income from its investment in Plains Pipeline as a result of Occidental's November 2014 sale of a portion of its Plains Pipeline interest.
797468_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Occidental, together with ADNOC, completed the Al Hosn gas processing facilities in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2014 and became fully operational in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Al Hosn gas processing facilities are designed to process 1.0 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, NGLs and sulfur.
797468_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Al Hosn gas processing facilities include facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and process it for sale.
797468_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The facility produces approximately 8,700 tons per day of sulfur, of which Occidental's share is approximately 3,500 tons of sulfur per day.
797468_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Occidental relies upon several sources to ensure an adequate supply of CO 2 for its Permian EOR operations, including the Occidental operated Bravo Dome field in northeastern New Mexico and additional supplies from methane fields in the southwestern Permian Basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Occidental s Century Plant in Pecos County, Texas, further expands its EOR infrastructure in the Permian Basin.
797468_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The plant processes natural gas with high CO 2 content, resulting in methane gas for the market as well as a major source of CO 2 for our Permian operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	Occidental s 2015 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2014 due to lower realized NGL prices, partially offset by the commencement of Al Hosn sulfur sales.
797468_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	The decrease in earnings in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower margins in lower spark spreads and decreased production resulting from increased planned outages.
797468_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	Marketing The marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, and trades around its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity.
797468_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Occidental s third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Marketing performance in 2015 declined compared to 2014 due to the narrowing of the Midland to Gulf Coast oil price differentials.
797468_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGLs prices, which cannot reasonably be predicted.
797468_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Generally, higher NGLs prices result in higher profitability.
797468_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	The marketing business in isolation can be volatile in periods of severe price swings.
797468_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	Occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders.
797468_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	The statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014 because of the spin-off from Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	See footnotes following significant transactions and events affecting Occidental's earnings.
797468_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	The following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	(b) The 2014 amount represented the gain on sale of the Hugoton properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	(c) The 2015 amount included approximately $1.6 billion of impairment and related charges associated with non-core domestic oil and gas assets in the Williston Basin (sold in November 2015) and Piceance Basin (held for sale as of December 31, 2015).
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S3	The remaining 2015 charges are mainly associated with the decline in commodity prices and management changes to future development plans.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S4	The 2014 and 2013 amounts were mainly comprised of impairment and related charges on the Williston and Piceance assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S5	(d) The 2015 amount included impairment and related charges of approximately $1.7 billion for operations where Occidental is exiting or reducing its involvement in and $3.4 billion related to the decline in commodity prices.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S6	(e) The 2015 amount included the gain on sale of an idled facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S7	The 2013 amount included the gain on sale of the investment in Carbocloro, a Brazilian chemical facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S8	(f) The 2014 amount included a $633 million gain on sale of Occidental s interest in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, and a $1.4 billion gain on sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S9	The 2013 amount included a $1.0 billion gain on sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S10	The 2015 amount included an impairment charge of $814 million related to the Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S11	The 2015 amount included a $227 million other-than-temporary loss on Occidental s investment in California Resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S12	The 2015 amount included a $322 million pre-tax gain related to the Ecuador settlement.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S13	See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM7_P112_S14	The 2014 and 2013 amounts include the results of Occidental's California operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	Oil and gas segment results in 2015 included pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion on domestic and international assets, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	Approximately $1.3 billion of the domestic impairment and related charges were due to the exit of Occidental s operations in the Williston Basin, which was sold in November 2015 and in the Piceance Basin, where assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	development activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	Internationally, the impairments and related charges were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce our exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	Earnings in 2014 included pre-tax charges of $5.3 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of Hugoton assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	Earnings in 2013 included pre-tax charges of $0.6 billion for the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	Domestic oil and gas segment results, excluding impairment and other charges in both years, reflected a loss of approximately $700 million in 2015 compared to income of $1.9 billion in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S5	The decrease in domestic earnings reflected significantly lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and lower operating costs from lower workover and maintenance costs and lower DD A expenses.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S6	International oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairments and other charges, were $1.2 billion in 2015 and $4.0 billion in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S7	The decrease in international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S8	Average production costs for 2015, excluding taxes other than on income, were $11.57 per BOE, compared to $13.50 per BOE for 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S9	The decrease in average costs reflected decreased activity in downhole maintenance and lower overall cost structure.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S10	Average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding assets sold, increased by 81,000 BOE to 652,000 BOE in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S11	Average domestic daily production increased by 20,000 BOE to 312,000 BOE in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S12	During this same time period, domestic daily oil production increased by over 15 percent or 25,000 barrels per day to 187,000 barrels, all coming from Permian Resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S13	An increase in Permian Resources production was partially offset by lower natural gas and oil production in Piceance and South Texas where we have ceased all gas drilling activities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S14	International average daily production volumes increased to 340,000 BOE in 2015 from 279,000 BOE in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S15	The increase was primarily due to the start up of production from Al Hosn and higher production in Colombia.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S16	Total company average daily sales volumes were 658,000 BOE per day in 2015 and 572,000 BOE per day in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S17	Domestic oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairment and other charges in both years, were $1.9 billion in 2014 compared to $2.5 billion in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S18	The decrease in domestic earnings reflected lower crude oil and NGLs prices, higher operating costs from increased workover and maintenance activities, and higher DD A expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and improved realized prices for natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S19	International oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairments, were $4.0 billion in 2014 and $4.6 billion in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P117_S20	International earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses and DD A.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding assets sold, were 571,000 BOE and 573,000 BOE in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	Average domestic daily production volumes were 292,000 BOE in 2014 and 285,000 BOE in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	During this same time period, domestic daily oil production increased by 6 percent or 9,000 barrels per day to 162,000 barrels, mainly coming from Permian Resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S3	International average daily production volumes decreased to 279,000 BOE in 2014 from 289,000 BOE in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S4	The decrease was primarily due to lower cost recovery barrels in Iraq and insurgent activities in Colombia, Libya and Yemen.
797468_16_ITEM7_P118_S5	Total company average daily sales volumes were 572,000 BOE in both 2014 and 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments of $121 million and gain on sale of $98 million from the sale of an idled facility, were $565 million in 2015 compared to $569 million, excluding asset impairments of $149 million, in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The year over year decrease was primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volumes across most products, offset by improved PVC margins resulting primarily from lower energy and ethylene costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P119_S2	Chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments of $149 million in 2014 and gain on sale of $131 million from the sale of the Carbocloro investment in 2013, were $569 million in 2014 compared to $612 million in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P119_S3	The lower earnings in 2014 were primarily a result of lower caustic soda pricing driven by new chlor-alkali capacity in the industry and higher energy and ethylene costs, partially offset by higher PVC margins and improved volumes across most product lines.
797468_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings were $65 million in 2015, compared to $549 million in 2014, excluding impairments and related item charges of $1.3 billion mainly consisting of the impairment charge of the Century Gas Processing Plant in 2015 and $2.0 billion of gains comprised of the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and part of Occidental's investment in Plains Pipeline in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The decrease in earnings primarily reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of the Midland to Gulf Coast differentials, lower domestic gas processing income due to lower NGL prices and lower pipeline income as a result of lower Dolphin Pipeline gas sales and the decrease in Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014, excluding impairments and other items and gains on sales of $2.0 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013, were $549 million in 2014, compared to $537 million in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	The increase in earnings reflected higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses, partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income.
797468_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $2.0 billion, were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	(a) Represents amounts attributable to income from continuing operations after deducting a non controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	The non controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings.
797468_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	Occidental's 2015 worldwide effective tax rate was 14 percent, which is lower than in 2014 mainly due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income, domestic asset impairments that are taxed at statutory rates and foreign oil and gas asset impairments, the majority of which have no reported tax benefits.
797468_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Excluding the impact of impairments and other nonrecurring items, Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate for 2015 would be 86 percent.
797468_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $115 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of continuing operations are discussed below:
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	The decrease in net sales in 2015 , compared to 2014 , was mainly due to the significant decline in worldwide oil, NGLs and gas prices, partially offset by higher domestic and international crude oil volumes.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	Average WTI and Brent prices fell by nearly 50 percent and NYMEX gas prices fell by over 35 percent in 2015 as compared to 2014 prices.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	The decrease in net sales in 2014 , compared to 2013 , was due to a significant decline in the fourth quarter of 2014 in worldwide oil and NGLs prices, partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes, and higher domestic natural gas prices.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S3	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment income which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net income than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S4	The 2015 gains on sale included $98 million for the sale of an idled facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S5	The 2014 gains on sale included $1.4 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline, $633 million for the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and $531 million for the sale of Hugoton properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P127_S6	The 2013 gains on sale included $1.0 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and $131 million for the sale of the Carbocloro investment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	Cost of sales decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to lower energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment, lower fuel costs in the power generation operations and lower worldwide production costs, including workovers and downhole maintenance costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	Cost of sales increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment and increased domestic down hole maintenance activities and higher costs for purchased injectants in the oil and gas segment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to lower compensation expense.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S2	DD A increased in 2015, compared to 2014 due to higher production volumes partially offset by lower DD A rates.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S3	Asset impairments and related items in 2015 of $10.2 billion included charges of $3.5 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to Occidental s exit from the Williston and Piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S4	International oil and gas charges of $5.0 billion were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable.

797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S9	Asset impairments and related items in 2013 of $621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S10	Taxes other than on income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due primarily to lower oil, NGL and gas prices, which resulted in lower ad valorem and severance taxes.
797468_16_ITEM7_P129_S11	Taxes other than on income in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	Provision for income taxes decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to the pre-tax loss in 2015 as a result of the lower price environment and impairments and related charges.
797468_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	Provision for income taxes decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by certain nondeductible charges which increased the effective rate.

797468_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	The decline in trade receivables, net, was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2015, compared to the end of 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	Inventories decreased as a result of lower per unit values assigned to oil and gas inventories.
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S3	Other current assets increased as a result of receivables recorded for the federal and state tax refunds anticipated on the net operating loss carryback.
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S4	The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to 2015 contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture, partially offset by a financing distribution from Dolphin Energy.
797468_16_ITEM7_P133_S5	The decrease in the available for sale investment is the result of an other than temporary impairment recognized with respect to the value of Occidental's retained interest in California Resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	record as of February 29, 2016, to be distributed on March 24, 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	The decrease in PP E, net, was due to DD A and asset impairments, partially offset by capital expenditures.
797468_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current maturities of long-term debt was related to Occidental's 4.125-percent and 2.5-percent Senior Notes due in 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	The decrease in accounts payable reflected lower marketing payables as a result of lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2015, and lower accrued capital expenditures as Occidental reduced its capital budget.
797468_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Liabilities of assets held for sale represented liabilities to be transferred with the Piceance field.
797468_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes was due to the decrease in the difference between the book and tax basis of Occidental's oil and gas properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to contractual obligations related to assets held for sale.
797468_16_ITEM7_P136_S3	The decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends, share repurchases, and the 2015 net loss.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2015 , Occidental had approximately $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion in restricted cash.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S3	As a result of the tax-free status of the spin-off of California Resources, Occidental's use of restricted cash is limited to the payment of dividends, repayment of debt or share repurchases.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S4	To retain the tax-free status of the spin-off, the restricted cash must be used for one of these purposes within eighteen months from the date of distribution.
797468_16_ITEM7_P137_S5	Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends.
797468_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	In June 2015, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of debt that was comprised of $750 million of 3.50-percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750 million of 4.625-percent senior unsecured notes due 2045.
797468_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.48 billion.
797468_16_ITEM7_P138_S2	Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year for both series of notes, beginning on December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P138_S3	In February 2016, Occidental retired $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that had matured.
797468_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	In August 2014, Occidental entered into a new five-year, $2.0 billion bank credit facility (Credit Facility) in order to replace its previous $2.0 billion bank credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in October 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	The 2014 Credit Facility does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow under this facility.
797468_16_ITEM7_P139_S2	Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the Credit Facility during 2015 and no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2015 .

797468_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	Occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 decreased $5.6 billion to $3.3 billion, from $8.9 billion in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide realized oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices throughout 2015, which on a year-over-year basis declined 48 percent, 57 percent, and 42 percent, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S2	The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by higher production and lower operating costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S3	The usage of working capital in 2015 reflected lower realized prices that impacted receivable collections and payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in 2015.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S4	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $1.3 billion in 2014 to $8.9 billion, compared to $10.2 billion in 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S5	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower oil prices in the second half of 2014, which on a year-over-year basis declined 8 percent domestically and 9 percent worldwide, and higher domestic operating expenses for increased workover activity and higher prices for purchased injectants.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S6	Also in 2014, Occidental paid higher income taxes, in part related to the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline and the first half of 2014 sale of Hugoton assets, while 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S7	Working capital changes in receivables reflected higher collections in the first half of 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S8	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S9	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S10	The chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S11	Occidental booked significant non-cash adjustments to income as a result of lower product prices and management s strategic review.
797468_16_ITEM7_P141_S12	Asset impairments and related items were $9.7 billion , $7.4 billion and $0.6 billion for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

797468_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	In 2015, Occidental filed for an extension of time for payment of taxes by a corporation expecting a net operating loss carryback.
797468_16_ITEM7_P144_S1	The other operating, net, for 2015 of $650 million represented the federal and state tax benefit on the carryback of the 2015 net operating loss, of which $358 million will be applied to the 2014 federal balance due and the remainder will be received in cash during 2016.
797468_16_ITEM7_P144_S2	The $382 million in 2013 reflected the collection of a tax refund related to the 2012 net operating loss carryback.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	Occidental's net capital expenditures declined $3.1 billion in 2015 to $5.6 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	The decline is the result of lower spending in oil and gas non-core operations in the United States and Middle East and reduced expenditures on long-term projects coming on line at the end of 2014.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S2	Compared to $7.2 billion in 2013, Occidental's net capital expenditures for 2014 were $8.7 billion after netting of partner contributions for the BridgeTex pipeline, which is included in financing activities, and the Chemical joint venture.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S3	The increase in capital expenditures of $1.5 billion from 2013 to 2014 was due to increased development activity in the domestic oil and gas operations, primarily Permian Resources.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S4	The increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to higher spending for the Al Hosn gas project and BridgeTex pipeline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S5	While the 2016 environment remains challenging, Occidental remains committed to allocating capital to only its highest return projects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P145_S6	Occidental's 2016 capital spending is expected to be no more than $3 billion.

797468_16_ITEM7_P148_S6	The 2014 net cash used by financing activities included $2.5 billion for purchases of treasury stock and $2.2 billion for dividend payments, which were partially offset by $0.4 billion for contributions received from a noncontrolling interest.

797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 13 of the 149 sites described above, and 101 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a remediation site in Texas accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S2	In connection with the 1986 acquisition of DSCC stock, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 66 third-party sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S4	Four of the remaining 58 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 50 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P172_S5	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and New York accounted for 59 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	Five other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware and Washington and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 70 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_16_ITEM7_P174_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_16_ITEM7_P175_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $370 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P175_S2	See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures" for additional information.
797468_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	Environmental Costs Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $116 million for 2016 .
797468_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	At December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $9.8 billion or 23 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_16_ITEM7_P179_S2	Of such assets, approximately $8.3 billion are located in Middle East/North Africa and approximately $1.3 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_16_ITEM7_P179_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , net sales outside North America totaled $4.9 billion, or approximately 40 percent of total net sales.
797468_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_16_ITEM7_P180_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_16_ITEM7_P180_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_16_ITEM7_P180_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P183_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_16_ITEM7_P183_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_16_ITEM7_P183_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_16_ITEM7_P184_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_16_ITEM7_P184_S2	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_16_ITEM7_P187_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S5	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S6	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S7	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P188_S8	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_16_ITEM7_P189_S0	In 2015 , negative revisions of previous estimates of 315 million BOE were primarily price and price-related associated with domestic assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P189_S1	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P189_S2	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P189_S3	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_16_ITEM7_P190_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_16_ITEM7_P190_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_16_ITEM7_P191_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_16_ITEM7_P192_S0	estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P193_S0	It is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
797468_16_ITEM7_P193_S1	The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate.
797468_16_ITEM7_P193_S2	For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.65 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $155 million annually at current production rates.
797468_16_ITEM7_P193_S3	The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $0.3 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_16_ITEM7_P194_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S0	Chemical Assets Occ idental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_16_ITEM7_P195_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_16_ITEM7_P196_S0	estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_16_ITEM7_P196_S1	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_16_ITEM7_P196_S2	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_16_ITEM7_P197_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P197_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_16_ITEM7_P197_S2	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.4 billion and its depreciation expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $300 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P197_S3	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_16_ITEM7_P197_S4	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnin gs by approximately $50 million per year.
797468_16_ITEM7_P198_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_16_ITEM7_P199_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_16_ITEM7_P199_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_16_ITEM7_P200_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_16_ITEM7_P200_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P201_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_16_ITEM7_P202_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_16_ITEM7_P202_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P203_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_16_ITEM7_P204_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_16_ITEM7_P205_S0	effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P206_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_16_ITEM7_P207_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_16_ITEM7_P207_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_16_ITEM7_P208_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P208_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_16_ITEM7_P209_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P209_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_16_ITEM7_P209_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_16_ITEM7_P209_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_16_ITEM7_P210_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_16_ITEM7_P210_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_16_ITEM7_P211_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_16_ITEM7_P211_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_16_ITEM7_P212_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_16_ITEM7_P213_S0	are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_16_ITEM7_P214_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_16_ITEM7_P214_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S0	Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_16_ITEM7_P215_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_16_ITEM7_P216_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_16_ITEM7_P217_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_16_ITEM7_P217_S1	Occidental had accruals to income for highly probable reimbursements or recoveries of $13 million in 2015 and no accruals in 2014 and 2013.
797468_16_ITEM7_P218_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_16_ITEM7_P218_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_16_ITEM7_P219_S0	negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_16_ITEM7_P219_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_16_ITEM7_P219_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_16_ITEM7_P219_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_16_ITEM7_P219_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_16_ITEM7_P220_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_16_ITEM7_P220_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $39 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P220_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $39 million.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S1	Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S4	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM7_P221_S5	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.

SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2, "Business and Properties," Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.
797468_16_ITEM7_P223_S0	Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "might," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "aim," "goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements.
797468_16_ITEM7_P223_S1	You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
797468_16_ITEM7_P223_S2	Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
797468_16_ITEM7_P224_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $120 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGLs prices.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $45 million.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	The marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P0_S9	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $25 million.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	According to IHS Chemical, 2015 average contract prices were: chlorine $265 per ton; caustic soda $580 per ton; and PVC $0.64 per lb.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Additionally, these operations maintain highly liquid positions, as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Fair values for these contracts are derived principally from Level 1 and Level 2 sources.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Note : Includes cash-flow hedges further discussed below.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	At December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2014, Occidental did not have any cash-flow hedges on stored volumes of natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair value with at least a 95 percent level of confidence.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Additionally, Occidental uses trading limits, including, among others, limits on total notional trade value, and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P8_S3	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $24 million .
797468_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Occidental actively reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties and monitors credit exposures against assigned credit limits by adjusting credit limits to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM7A_P14_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2015 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P15_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P15_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P15_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial.
797468_16_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts.
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_16_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation: We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Occidental Petroleum Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_16_ITEM8_P2_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

797468_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	As a result of the spin-off of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) the statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources for additional information.
797468_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	Revenues from the production of oil and gas properties in which Occidental has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Occidental s net revenue interest.
797468_16_ITEM8_P19_S4	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Revenue from marketing and trading activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue from all marketing and trading activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement.
797468_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2015 , and net sales of approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss, delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash is the result of the separation of California Resources.
797468_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was $1.2 billion and $4.0 billion of cash restricted, respectively, for the payment of dividends, payment of debt or share repurchases.
797468_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	Restricted cash must be used within 18 months of the date of distribution.
797468_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends.
797468_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	A decline in market value of any available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	To determine whether an impairment is other than temporary, Occidental considers all available information relevant to the investment, including past events and current conditions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P31_S4	Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.
797468_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	INVENTORIES Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_16_ITEM8_P32_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_16_ITEM8_P35_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	See Note 15 and below for further discussion of asset impairments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $0.3 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_16_ITEM8_P44_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_16_ITEM8_P45_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	IMPAIRMENTS AND RELATED ITEMS In 2015, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges on oil and gas assets due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the decision to sell or exit non-core assets and changes in development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota and in December 2015, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	In Iraq, Occidental has issued a notice of withdrawal and is working to reassign its interest in the Zubair Field in accordance with the contract terms.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	In Yemen, Occidental s non-operated interest in Block 10 East Shabwa Field expired in December 2015, and in February 2016, Occidental sold its interests in Block S-1, An Nagyah Field.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S4	In addition, Occidental has been reducing its activity and exposure in Bahrain and Libya.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S5	Occidental has suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in Libya, and production disruptions continued throughout 2015 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S6	The midstream and marketing segment recorded an impairment charge for the Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S7	In 2014, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges mainly for Williston, Bahrain, the Joslyn oil sands project and other non-core domestic gas properties due to declining prices and changes in development plans.
797468_16_ITEM8_P48_S8	Impairment and related charges in 2013 were mostly related to the impairment of nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage.
797468_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	(a) A portion of the 2015 charges are reported in the Midstream and Marketing segment.
797468_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	It is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace, or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $188 million and $361 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_16_ITEM8_P58_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant.
797468_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Occidental had accruals to income for highly probable reimbursements or recoveries of $13 million in 2015 and no accruals in 2014 and 2013.
797468_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Many factors could affect Occidental's future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_16_ITEM8_P62_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_16_ITEM8_P63_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P64_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1 billion is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at both December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs) and capital employed incentive awards and return on assets (ROCEI/ROAI), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock and the estimated payout at the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	For total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from a Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Compensation expense for RSUs, ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	Compensation expense for the dividends accrued on unvested awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria, if applicable.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S4	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_16_ITEM8_P75_S5	The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, which are more fully described in Note 13, in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_16_ITEM8_P83_S3	Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $1.0 billion , $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately $445 million , $610 million and $606 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States.
797468_16_ITEM8_P84_S2	Interest paid totaled approximately $246 million , $219 million and $238 million , net of capitalized interest of $138 million , $180 million and $137 million , for the years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income.
797468_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.
797468_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	In January 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Occidental Tower building in Dallas, Texas for net proceeds of approximately $85 million.
797468_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	The building was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	In January 2016, Occidental reached an understanding on the terms of payment for the approximate $1.0 billion payable to Occidental by the Republic of Ecuador under a November 2015 International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes arbitration award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	This award relates to Ecuador's 2006 expropriation of Occidental's Participation Contract for Block 15.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	As of December 31, 2015, Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain of $322 million.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	As of February 26, 2016, Occidental has received approximately $322 million in proceeds.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S4	The result of this settlement with Ecuador has been presented as discontinued operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P89_S5	In December 2015, Occidental entered a sales agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for approximately $155 million.

797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules modifying certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The rules require equity investments, except for those accounted for as equity method or those that lead to consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value and any change to fair value be recognized through net income.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	If the equity investments do not have a readily determinable fair value, the entity can elect to measure at cost minus impairment plus or minus any changes in observable price for similar investments of the same issuer.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S3	In addition, the rules simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to measure impairment.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S4	If the assessment indicates impairment exist, the entity is required to measure the investment at fair value.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S5	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
797468_16_ITEM8_P97_S6	The rules are not expected to have a significant impact on Occidental s financial statements upon adoption.
797468_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued rules modifying how entities present deferred income tax liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	Under current GAAP, an entity is required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the statement of financial position.
797468_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	In order to simplify presentation, the new rules require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
797468_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be adopted earlier on a voluntary basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P98_S4	Occidental adopted these rules prospectively as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued rules removing the obligation for a business acquirer to retrospectively recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that were identified during the measurement period of a business combination.
797468_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	Under the new rules, the acquirer is required to record in the same period's financial statements the effect on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P99_S3	The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued rules to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard, previously issued in May 2014, to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
797468_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	Under the new rules, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services.
797468_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	The new rules also require more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
797468_16_ITEM8_P100_S3	Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	In May 2015, the FASB issued rules modifying how entities measure certain investments at net asset value as well as how they are categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
797468_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	The new rules remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share.
797468_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	The update also removes the requirement for certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practice, and instead requires it for only those investments the entity elects to measure as such.
797468_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P101_S4	The rules will not have a significant impact on Occidental s financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued rules simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	The new rules require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
797468_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P102_S3	The rules will not have a significant impact on Occidental s financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued rules modifying how an entity should evaluate certain legal entities for consolidation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	The modifications change how limited partnerships and similar legal entities are evaluated, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate limited partnerships, change the consolidation analysis for reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, and change the scope exception for certain legal entities, among other things.
797468_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P103_S3	The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued rules which eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary item.
797468_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.
797468_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	The rules do not have an impact on Occidental s financial statements upon adoption.
797468_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that grant their employees share-based payment awards in which the terms of the awards provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	The new rules require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
797468_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	Entities may apply the update either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
797468_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	These rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P105_S4	The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $189 million and $199 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

797468_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2019.
797468_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_16_ITEM8_P109_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2015 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.

797468_16_ITEM8_P113_S4	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_16_ITEM8_P113_S5	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $318 million and $336 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt.
797468_16_ITEM8_P113_S6	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	At December 31, 2015 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $8.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion is due in 2016, $1.3 billion is due in 2017, $0.5 billion is due in 2018, $0.1 billion is due in 2019, zero is due in 2020 and $5 billion is due in 2021 and thereafter.
797468_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $8.4 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $8.3 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses.
797468_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	At December 31, 2015 , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:
797468_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	Rental expense for operating leases was $197 million in 2015 , $155 million in 2014 and $196 million in 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	Occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does so, the volumes are usually insignificant.
797468_16_ITEM8_P119_S2	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 2017.
797468_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental had approximately 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas.

797468_16_ITEM8_P120_S4	The following table presents the after-tax gains and losses recognized in, and reclassified to income from, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), for derivative instruments classified as cash-flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
797468_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	The amount of the ineffective portion of cash-flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following table summarizes Occidental's net volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
797468_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	The volumes in the table above exclude contracts tied to index prices, for which the fair value, if any, is minimal at any point in time.
797468_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	These excluded contracts do not expose Occidental to price risk because the contract prices fluctuate with index prices.
797468_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Occidental fulfills its short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.
797468_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial portion of the outstanding positions at year-end and has sufficient production capacity and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.

797468_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	(b) As of December 31, 2015, collateral received of $14 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $4 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	(c) As of December 31, 2014, collateral received of zero has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $8 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	(d) Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
797468_16_ITEM8_P125_S4	Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $3 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, deposited by Occidental, has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables.
797468_16_ITEM8_P125_S5	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	See Note 15 for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives.
797468_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	Occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral, as appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	Occidental actively reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties and monitors credit exposures against assigned credit limits by adjusting credit limits to reflect counterparty risk, if necessary.
797468_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_16_ITEM8_P130_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.

797468_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 149 sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($70 million in 2015, $79 million in 2014, and $78 million in 2013) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ($316 million in 2015, $255 million in 2014, and $252 million in 2013).
797468_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA NPL sites and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 13 of the 149 sites described above, and 101 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S1	As of December 31, 2015, two sites a landfill in western New York owned by Occidental and a remediation site in Texas accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S2	In connection with the 1986 acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) stock, Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 14 of the remaining NPL sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S3	As of December 31, 2015, Maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying Occidental for 8 of the 66 third-party sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S4	Three of the remaining 58 third-party sites a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 50 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P136_S5	Four sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and New York accounted for 59 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	Five other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware and Washington and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 70 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	The following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
797468_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $370 million.
797468_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_16_ITEM8_P143_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_16_ITEM8_P143_S3	Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_16_ITEM8_P143_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	In December 2014, a New Jersey state court approved Occidental s settlement with the State of New Jersey (the State) to resolve claims asserted by the State against Occidental arising from Occidental s acquisition of DSCC.
797468_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	During 2015, pursuant to the settlement agreement (State Settlement) Occidental paid the State $190 million.
797468_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Under certain circumstances, Occidental agreed to perform or fund future work on behalf of the State along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	When Occidental acquired the stock of DSCC in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (Maxus), retained liability for the Lister Avenue Plant, which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, as well as other sites.
797468_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	Maxus is also obligated to indemnify Occidental for the State Settlement.
797468_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	Occidental is pursuing Maxus to recover the settlement costs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P146_S3	The State Settlement does not cover any potential Occidental share of costs associated with the EPA s proposed clean-up plan of the Passaic River, announced in April 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P146_S4	Maxus is also responsible for federal clean-up or other costs associated with the Lister Avenue Plant and the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site.
797468_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_16_ITEM8_P147_S1	Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters.
797468_16_ITEM8_P147_S2	Reserve balances for other matters as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above.
797468_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	Occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_16_ITEM8_P148_S2	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_16_ITEM8_P149_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to IRS review.
797468_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	Taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P150_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P152_S2	At December 31, 2015 , total purchase obligations were $9.9 billion, which included approximately $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.6 billion that will be paid in 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2019 and 2020 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P152_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2016 and thereafter, which were approximately $0.8 billion.
797468_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_16_ITEM8_P153_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	The current portion of total deferred tax assets was $110 million as of December 31, 2014 which was reported in other current assets.
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	Total deferred tax assets were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, the noncurrent portion of which is netted against deferred tax liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S2	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S3	The reduction in net deferred tax liabilities from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to asset impairments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S4	Occidental had, as of December 31, 2015 , foreign tax credit carryforward of $2.0 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2025, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2025.
797468_16_ITEM8_P158_S5	Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit and state operating loss carryforwards.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $9.9 billion, net of foreign taxes, at December 31, 2015, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S1	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $115 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S2	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $1 million, $454 million, and $550 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S3	Additional paid-in capital was credited zero in 2015 , $4 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013 for an excess tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $22 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_16_ITEM8_P159_S5	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount.
797468_16_ITEM8_P160_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:
797468_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	TREASURY STOCK On October 2, 2014, Occidental increased the total number of shares authorized for its share repurchase program by 60 million shares to 185 million shares total; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	In 2015 and 2014 , respectively, Occidental purchased 7.4 million and 25.8 million shares under the program at an average cost of $76.99 and $93.40 per share, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P164_S2	Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during each year.
797468_16_ITEM8_P164_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , treasury stock shares numbered 127.7 million, 120.0 million and 93.9 million, respectiv ely.
797468_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.
797468_16_ITEM8_P165_S1	At December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.
797468_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax amounts:
797468_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	(a) See Note 13 for further information.
797468_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	Occidental has established several plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards including in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	An aggregate of 35 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 1.7 million shares had been allocated to employee awards through December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	In accordance with the terms of the shareholder approved 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), awards issued under the superseded 2005 LTIP and subsequently forfeited after adoption of the 2015 LTIP increase the shares available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP.
797468_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 33 million shares were available for grants of future awards.
797468_16_ITEM8_P170_S2	The plan requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_16_ITEM8_P170_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 33 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_16_ITEM8_P170_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash, including awards that were issued under a previous plan that remain outstanding.
797468_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	During 2015 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 28,554 shares of common stock.
797468_16_ITEM8_P171_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the closing quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following table summarizes total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31:
797468_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	(a) Includes cash paid under the cash-settled portion of the SARs, RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P173_S1	(b) As measured on the vesting date for the stock-settled portion of the RSUs and TSRIs.
797468_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards was $142 million.
797468_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	RSUs Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria based on net income or earnings per share, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S2	These awards vest from one to four years following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S3	For certain RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S4	For those awards that cliff vest between one to three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting or performance period, as appropriate, and are paid upon certification of the award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $72.64, $100.95, and $89.70 per share, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S6	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were $72.54, $101.77, and $90.35, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P175_S7	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below:
797468_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	TSRIs Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of a three-year period following the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	Payout is based upon Occidental's total shareholder return performance relative to its peers and the S P 500.
797468_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	TSRIs granted in 2015 have payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P176_S3	TSRIs granted in July 2014 and 2013 have payouts that range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award; all outstanding TSRIs settle fully in stock once certified.
797468_16_ITEM8_P176_S4	Dividend equivalents for TSRIs are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P179_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	A summary of Occidental s unvested TSRIs as of December 31, 2015 , and changes during the year ended December 31, 2015 , is presented below:
797468_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	(a) Presented at the target or mid-point payouts.
797468_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) or Options that are settled in stock.
797468_16_ITEM8_P183_S1	Exercise prices of the Options were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P183_S2	Options granted in 2015 vest ratably over three years from the grant date with a maximum term of seven years.
797468_16_ITEM8_P183_S3	These Options and SARs may be forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.
797468_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	The fair value of each Option or stock-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_16_ITEM8_P184_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the vesting and expiration terms of the award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P184_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on US Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_16_ITEM8_P185_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P185_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015 :
797468_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	ROCEI / ROAI Occidental grants share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period if performance targets based on return on assets of the applicable segment or return on capital employed are certified as being met.
797468_16_ITEM8_P187_S1	These awards are settled in stock at the time of vesting, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P187_S2	Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.
797468_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	California Resources Spin-off Adjustments In connection with the separation of California Resources, Occidental entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with California Resources, which provided that employees of California Resources no longer participate in incentive programs sponsored or maintained by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, Occidental made certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of share-based compensation awards, with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to the separation for all Occidental employees.
797468_16_ITEM8_P188_S2	The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, or the number of potentially dilutive securities as of December 31, 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, level and employee contributions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P190_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_16_ITEM8_P190_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $175 million and $163 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $136 million in 2015 , $146 million in 2014 and $140 million in 2013 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 600 domestic and 1,200 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_16_ITEM8_P193_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_16_ITEM8_P193_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $200 million in 2015 , $215 million in 2014 and $229 million in 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	SPIN-OFF OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES In connection with the spin-off of California Resources in 2014, Occidental entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with California Resources, see Note 17, which provides that employees of California Resources no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Occidental as of the separation date.
797468_16_ITEM8_P194_S1	In 2014, the Occidental pension and postretirement plans transferred assets and obligations to the California Resources plans resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $15 million and $72 million, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P194_S2	Additionally, as a result of the transfer of unrecognized losses to California Resources, deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income decreased $14 million and $36 million, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values:
797468_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans:
797468_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2016 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs:
797468_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $13 million and zero, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P199_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $20 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	(a) Plans requiring a salary increase assumption were separated with California Resources in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2015 and 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	The assumed long term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
797468_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	In 2015, Occidental adopted the Society of Actuaries 2015 Mortality Improvement Scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined benefit retirement plans in the United States use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor s pension obligations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	The new mortality improvement scale reflects additional data that the Social Security Administration has released since the 2014 Mortality Tables Report and Mortality Improvement Scale released in 2014.
797468_16_ITEM8_P204_S2	This additional data shows a lower degree of mortality improvement than previously reflected.
797468_16_ITEM8_P204_S3	The changes in the mortality table results in a decrease of $5 million and $23 million in the pension and postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.5 percent to 10 percent at both December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P205_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.5 percent to 10 percent in 2015 , depending on local economic conditions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 1.60 percent and 1.79 percent as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_16_ITEM8_P206_S1	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_16_ITEM8_P206_S2	For those union employees, Occidental projected that health care cost trend rates would decrease 0.25 percent per year from 7.5 percent in 2015 until they reach 5.0 percent in 2025, and remain at 5.0 percent thereafter.
797468_16_ITEM8_P206_S3	A 1 percent increase or a 1 percent decrease in these assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of $55 million or a reduction of $46 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P206_S4	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	The investments are monitored by Occidental s Pension and Retirement Trust and Investment Committee (Investment Committee) in its role as fiduciary.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S2	The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S3	Equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S4	Other asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S5	The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P208_S6	Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
797468_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	(a) This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries.
797468_16_ITEM8_P210_S1	(b) This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities.
797468_16_ITEM8_P210_S2	(c) This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries.
797468_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	The activity during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , for the assets using Level 3 fair value measurements was insignificant.
797468_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	Occidental expects to contribute $8 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during 2016 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENTS As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of equity-method investments, respectively.

797468_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $625 million, of which almost $542 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives.
797468_16_ITEM8_P215_S1	The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments:
797468_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a 24.5 -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment.
797468_16_ITEM8_P216_S1	In November 2014 and October 2013, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, resulting in pre-tax gains of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

797468_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows.
797468_16_ITEM8_P223_S1	These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8-20 percent.
797468_16_ITEM8_P223_S2	These properties were impacted by persistently worldwide low oil and natural gas prices and changing management's development plans.
797468_16_ITEM8_P223_S3	Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
797468_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	In the fourth quarter 2015, Occidental recognized approximately $814 million in pre-tax impairment charges for a Midstream CO 2 treatment plant related to recurring CO 2 shortfalls and unpaid penalty fees.

797468_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	Lower crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities that can be produced economically, which may reduce Occidental's revenues, operating income and cash flows.
797468_16_ITEM8_P243_S1	Recent global economic conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly.
797468_16_ITEM8_P243_S2	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_16_ITEM8_P243_S3	Prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to further reduce capital spending, potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	(a) A majority of the proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements.
797468_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	(b) Revisions of previous estimates were primarily price and price-related.
797468_16_ITEM8_P244_S2	(c) Approximately 13 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2015 are nonproducing, primarily associated with Permian EOR.
797468_16_ITEM8_P244_S3	compared to the same prior year period is related to the sale of Occidental's Williston assets.

797468_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_16_ITEM8_P249_S2	For example, in 2015, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $48.80 per barrel and $2.75 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.

797468_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	(a) Includes acquisition costs, development costs, capitalized interest and asset retirement obligations.
797468_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	COSTS INCURRED Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	Occidental s oil and gas producing activities for continuing operations, which exclude items such as asset dispositions, corporate overhead, interest and royalties, were as follows:
797468_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	(a) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P254_S1	(b) Production costs are the costs incurred in lifting the oil and gas to the surface and include gathering, primary processing, field storage and insurance on proved properties, but do not include DD A, royalties, income taxes, interest, general and administrative and other expenses.
797468_16_ITEM8_P254_S2	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.

797468_16_ITEM8_P256_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_16_ITEM8_P256_S2	For example, in 2015, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $48.80 per barrel and $2.75 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.
797468_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	(b) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_16_ITEM8_P257_S1	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	For purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to Occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P258_S1	The realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P258_S2	Future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce proved reserves at year end.
797468_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	Future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows.
797468_16_ITEM8_P259_S1	The discount was computed by application of a 10 percent discount factor.
797468_16_ITEM8_P259_S2	The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P259_S3	Such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past.
797468_16_ITEM8_P259_S4	Other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results.

797468_16_ITEM8_P267_S3	(d) Acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves.
797468_16_ITEM8_P268_S0	Occidental s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases.
797468_16_ITEM8_P268_S1	Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.
797468_16_ITEM8_P268_S2	In some instances, Occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.
797468_16_ITEM8_P268_S3	In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions.
797468_16_ITEM8_P268_S4	Scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM8_P269_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 .
797468_16_ITEM8_P269_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_16_ITEM8_P270_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_16_ITEM8_P270_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.

797468_16_ITEM9_P0_S0	Occidental had no changes in, and no disagreements with, Occidental's accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2015 , Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.

797468_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 25, 2016 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of New Mexico and Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in the Middle East.
797468_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	At Occidental s request, we have also presented the portion of the total company net reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE.
797468_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.
797468_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation by a person who is qualified by experience and training equivalent to that of a Reserves Auditor to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, [and] (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_16_ITEM15_P39_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_16_ITEM15_P39_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_16_ITEM15_P41_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2015; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2015 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Approximately 20 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	The remaining 80 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.
797468_16_ITEM15_P48_S3	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	All of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO 2 injection and infill drilling.
797468_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2015 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s average realized prices.
797468_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
797468_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	A summary of average realized prices are not included for properties located in the Middle East because of host government s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
797468_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
797468_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_16_ITEM15_P61_S4	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_16_ITEM15_P63_S5	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2015, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
797468_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_16_ITEM15_P66_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Occidental the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S4	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S5	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_16_ITEM15_P68_S6	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P73_S3	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2015.
797468_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Ryder Scott is an employee-owned independent petroleum engineering consulting firm.
797468_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	We do not serve as officers or directors of any privately-owned or publicly-traded oil and gas company and are separate and independent from the operating and investment decision-making process of our clients.
797468_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	No single client or job represents a material portion of our annual revenue.
797468_16_ITEM15_P78_S3	These factors allow us to maintain our independence and objectivity in the performance of our services.
797468_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	Ryder Scott requires that staff engineers and geoscientists receive professional accreditation in the form of a registered or certified professional engineer s license or a registered or certified professional geoscientist s license, or the equivalent thereof, from an appropriate governmental authority or a recognized self-regulating professional organization.
797468_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	We are independent petroleum engineers with respect to Occidental.
797468_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	Neither we nor any of our employees have any interest in the subject properties and neither the employment to do this work nor the compensation is contingent on the results of our review.
797468_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The results of the reserves process review, presented herein, are based on technical analysis conducted by teams of geoscientists and engineers from Ryder Scott.
797468_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	The professional qualifications of the undersigned, the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the review of the reserves information discussed in this report, are included as an attachment to this letter.

797468_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
797468_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
797468_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
797468_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
797468_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
797468_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_16_ITEM15_P95_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_16_ITEM15_P95_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
797468_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
797468_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
797468_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
797468_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
797468_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
797468_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
797468_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
797468_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
797468_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
797468_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
797468_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
797468_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
797468_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_16_ITEM15_P105_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
797468_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
797468_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
797468_16_ITEM15_P106_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
797468_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
797468_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
797468_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
797468_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
797468_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
797468_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
797468_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
797468_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
797468_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
797468_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
797468_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
797468_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
797468_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
797468_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
797468_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
797468_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
797468_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
797468_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(2)] , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in weather patterns and climatic changes.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The impacts of the members of OPEC and other producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Generally, Occidental's practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products in the future.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly since 2014.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These conditions may continue for an extended period.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to reduce capital spending and impair the carrying value of assets.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Occidental bears the risks of equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	New or amended laws and regulations, or interpretations of such laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use or increased use of land, water and other natural resources, safety, security and environmental protection, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental's costs or reduce demand for Occidental's products.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits and authorizations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Occidental s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates, and the variance may be material.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with SEC regulations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect Occidental s operations or results.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, natural gas and other products that Occidental s businesses produce.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas and other products produced by Occidental s businesses.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Consequently, government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental s business, financial condition and results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	It is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required, the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered, and Occidental s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company s oil, natural gas and other products.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, crude oil releases, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Cyber-attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Occidental relies on digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing and pipeline operations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Use of the internet, cloud services and other public networks exposes Occidental s business to cyber-attacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, release confidential information, corrupt data and disrupt critical systems and operations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Even though Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber-attack, there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	While we have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	However, if in the future our cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient, the potential consequences to Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As cyber-attacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication, we may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance our cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and network security vulnerabilities.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
797468_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent a notice to an OPC subsidiary that it is seeking penalties of $165,600 related to a crude oil pipeline incident in Scurry County, Texas.
797468_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The subsidiary contested the penalties and is awaiting a decision.
797468_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_17_ITEM4_P0_S0	The current term of office of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 12, 2017 meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_17_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 26,000 stockholders of record at January 31, 2017 , and by approximately 700,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividends declared on the common stock were $0.75 for the first and second quarter of 2016 and $0.76 for the third and fourth quarter ($3.02 for the year).
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S4	On February 16, 2017 , a quarterly dividend of $0.76 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 14, 2017 , to stockholders of record on March 10, 2017 .
797468_17_ITEM5_P0_S5	The current annual dividend rate of $3.04 per share has increased by over 500 percent since 2002.
797468_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS All of Occidental's stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans is approximately 35 million, of which approximately 4.5 million had been reserved for issuance through December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) Includes shares reserved to be issued pursuant to stock options (Options), and performance-based awards.
797468_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	Shares for performance-based awards are included assuming maximum payout, but may be paid out at lesser amounts, or not at all, according to achievement of performance goals.
797468_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	(2) Price applies only to the Options included in column (a).
797468_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	Exercise price is not applicable to the other awards included in column (a).
797468_17_ITEM5_P4_S2	(3) A plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than stock appreciation rights (SARs) and Options) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_17_ITEM5_P4_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than the amount shown depending on the type of award granted.
797468_17_ITEM5_P4_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the amount shown may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 , were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	(a) Represents purchases from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	(b) Represents the total number of shares remaining at year end under Occidental's share repurchase program of 185 million shares.
797468_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	The program was initially announced in 2005.
797468_17_ITEM5_P7_S1	The program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500), which Occidental is included in, and with that of Occidental s peer group over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM5_P8_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in: (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500, and (iii) each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the peer group, and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	Occidental's peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Total S.A. and Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM5_P10_S0	The information provided in this Performance Graph shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Exchange Act, other than as provided in Item 201 to Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act except to the extent Occidental specifically requests that it be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporates it by reference.
797468_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	_______________________ (1) The cumulative total return of the peer group companies' common stock includes the cumulative total return of Occidental's common stock.

797468_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	STRATEGY General Through its operations, Occidental aims to maximize Total Shareholder Return through a combination of:
797468_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business.
797468_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	In 2016, Occidental continued to experience a challenging price environment with low oil, natural gas and NGLs prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	In order to manage this risk, Occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and may access capital markets, as necessary.
797468_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	In connection with Occidental's strategic review initiatives, Occidental:
797468_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Completed its exit of non-core operations in the Piceance Basin, Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.
797468_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following describes the application of Occidental s overall strategy for each of its operating segments:
797468_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Oil and Gas The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy primarily by:
797468_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Focusing many of Occidental's subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin.
797468_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	discipline, with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental's existing positions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	In 2016, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $2.0 billion, and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the Permian Basin and the Middle East.
797468_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	This activity reflects Occidental's strategy to focus on achieving returns above the cost of capital even in a low price environment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Management believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the Permian Basin and Colombia and focused international projects in the Middle East.
797468_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Chemical The primary objective of OxyChem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to external customers.
797468_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
797468_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that U.S. shale gas development has presented to U.S. chemical producers by providing low-cost ethane as a raw material.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The joint venture will provide OxyChem with an ongoing source of ethylene, significantly reducing OxyChem's reliance on third-party ethylene suppliers.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	The construction of the ethylene cracker remains on budget and on schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	In 2016, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $324 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S5	Additionally, $160 million was spent on the Mexichem joint venture.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S6	In the first quarter of 2016, OxyChem sold its Occidental Tower building in Dallas for a pre-tax gain of approximately $57 million and a non-core specialty chemicals business for a pre-tax gain of approximately $31 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S7	In 2016, OxyChem announced a $145 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Geismar, Louisiana.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S8	The project will produce an OxyChem patented new raw material used in making next-generation, climate-friendly refrigerants with a low global warming and ozone depletion potential.
797468_17_ITEM7_P16_S9	Construction work has begun with an anticipated completion date in late 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Midstream and Marketing The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	In order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other Occidental segments as well as third parties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The segment invests in and operates pipeline systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities, and storage facilities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses, while limiting credit risk exposure.
797468_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	In 2016, capital expenditures totaled $358 million related to Permian Basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure, Al Hosn Gas and the Ingleside Crude Terminal.
797468_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Key Performance Indicators Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Specific measures such as total spend per barrel, per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development costs and reserves replacement percentages.
797468_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s financial performance.
797468_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2016 and 2015 :
797468_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2016 and 2015 :
797468_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Average WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined 11 percent and 16 percent, from $48.80 and $53.64 in 2015 to $43.32 and $45.04 in 2016 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Average worldwide realized oil prices fell $8.37, or 18 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	However, the WTI and Brent oil price indexes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2016 , closing at $53.72 per barrel and $56.82 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 , well above the 2016 average prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2016 decreased 12 percent from 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	Average NYMEX natural gas prices declined 12 percent, from $2.75 in 2015 to $2.42 in 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The decline in oil and gas prices during 2016 and 2015, as well as the decision to sell or exit non-core assets, caused Occidental to assess the carrying value of all of its oil and gas producing assets and assess development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	In 2016, impairment and related charges were immaterial.
797468_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	In 2015, Occidental recorded total pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion for its domestic assets and $5.0 billion for its international assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	To assess carrying value of its oil and gas assets, Occidental uses oil and gas price curves settled on the last trading day of each quarter.
797468_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	While oil and gas future prices were increasing at the end of 2016 any future sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future.
797468_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operations 2016 Developments In March 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for approximately $153 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $121 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	In September 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties for $63 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $59 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	In October 2016, Occidental acquired producing and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin.
797468_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	This acquisition includes 35,000 net acres in Reeves and Pecos counties, Texas, in the Southern Delaware Basin, in areas where Occidental currently operates or has working interests.
797468_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	Separately, Occidental also acquired working interests in several producing oil and gas properties with CO 2 floods and related EOR infrastructure, increasing Occidental's ownership in several properties where it is currently the operator or an existing working interest partner.
797468_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In 2016, Occidental completed its exit of non-core operations in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.
797468_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Business Review Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.
797468_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Of the total 3.6 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 84 percent is leased, 15 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following charts show Occidental s domestic total production volumes for the last five years:
797468_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Excludes volumes from California Resources, which was separated on November 30, 2014, and included as discontinued operations for all applicable periods.
797468_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Permian Basin Occidental's Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The basin extends throughout west Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total United States oil production.
797468_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 12 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin.
797468_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the basin.
797468_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities and Permian EOR, which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as CO 2 floods and waterfloods.
797468_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	During 2016 , the Permian operations focused on full cycle value through capital efficiency, reduced operating expense, improved base production and new well productivity.
797468_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	In the Permian Basin, Occidental spent over $1.2 billion of capital in 2016 , with 60 percent spent on Permian Resources assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	In 2017 , Occidental expects to allocate approximately one third of the 2017 capital budget to Permian Resources for focused development areas in the Midland and Delaware Basins and approximately 10 to 15 percent to Permian EOR in order to add to existing facilities to increase CO 2 production and injection capacity for future projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Occidental's Permian Resources operations are among its fastest growing assets with over 11,650 drilling locations in its horizontal inventory located in the Midland and Delaware sub-basins.
797468_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	This inventory was developed using data gathered from appraisal efforts, and development drilling, along with offset operators drilling activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	As of year end, approximately 650 of these drilling locations represented proved reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	Continued wellbore placement and completion optimization through advanced subsurface characterization and the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, combined with projected commercial savings, are expected to increase the well inventory even further.
797468_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	The development program, which largely began in 2010, continued in 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	In 2016, Permian Resources drilled 63 horizontal wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Production from Permian Resources comes from approximately 5,550 net wells, of which 23 percent are operated by other operators.
797468_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	These investments in Permian wells operated by others allows Occidental to access and leverage additional data in the same areas where it is operating.
797468_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	By analyzing the operated by others data with the significant amount of data Occidental has gathered, its Permian operations are able to use the information to aid in reducing operating expenses, gain drilling and completions efficiencies, increase the productivity of its wells and improve the base production.
797468_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	In 2016, Permian Resources added 92 million BOE to Occidental's proved reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Permian EOR operates a combination of CO 2 floods and waterfloods, which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	implementation of CO 2 enhanced oil recovery projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Permian Basin s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO 2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO 2 supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	With 31 active floods and over 40 years of experience, Permian EOR is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO 2 flooding.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Occidental is an industry leader in applying this technology, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent in the fields where it is employed.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	Significant opportunity remains to expand Occidental's existing projects into new portions of reservoirs that thus far have only been water-flooded, leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new CO 2 injection.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	Technology improvements, such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Over the last few years, Occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells, with 125 wells deepened in 2016 and 100 wells planned for 2017 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional CO 2 floodable sections of the reservoir.
797468_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	These are low cost projects that can add reserves even in a low price environment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	In 2016, Permian EOR had its largest improved recovery additions in more than 10 years adding 72 million BOE to Occidental's proved reserves, primarily as a result of executing CO 2 flood development projects and expansions as well as extending the approved CO 2 slug size of current floods.
797468_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The current strategy for Permian EOR is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production and provide cash flow.
797468_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	By exploiting natural synergies between Permian EOR and Permian Resources, Occidental is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Occidental's share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 269,000 BOE per day in 2016 with 124,000 BOE per day coming from Permian Resources and 145,000 BOE per day from Permian EOR.
797468_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	South Texas and Other Occidental holds approximately 178,000 net acres in South Texas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Occidental's share of production in South Texas and Other was approximately 33,000 BOE per day.
797468_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	International Interests Production-Sharing Contracts Occidental's interests in Oman and Qatar are subject to production sharing contracts (PSC).
797468_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following charts show Occidental s international production volumes for the last five years:
797468_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Operations sold or exited include Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

797468_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	Occidental's share of production from Colombia was approximately 33,000 BOE per day in 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	Occidental also holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P58_S6	Occidental's share of production from Bolivia was 1,000 BOE per day in 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	were $42.75, $50.28 and $94.99 per barrel, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The calculated average Brent oil prices for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 disclosures were $44.49, $55.57 and $99.51, per barrel, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $2.55, $2.66 and $4.42 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2016 of 2,406 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2015 amount of 2,200 million BOE.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	Proved reserves at year-end 2016 and 2015 consisted of, respectively, 56 percent and 59 percent oil, 17 percent and 15 percent NGLs and 27 percent and 26 percent natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P60_S5	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 77 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2016 and 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Changes in Proved Reserves Occidental's total proved reserves increased 206 million BOE in 2016 , which included additions of 187 million BOE from Occidental's development program.
797468_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Changes in reserves were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Many of these factors are outside management s control, and may negatively or positively affect Occidental's reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P64_S4	Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental's share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	revisions in Oman due to the PSC impact, partially offset by negative domestic price revisions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	In 2016 , Occidental added proved reserves of 185 million BOE mainly associated with the Permian Basin and Oman operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO 2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The use of either CO 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO 2 or steam and other economic factors.
797468_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P68_S4	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	In 2016 , extensions and discoveries added 2 million BOE related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in Oman.
797468_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Purchases of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2016, Occidental purchased 137 million BOE of proved reserves in the Permian Basin, which mainly came from acquisitions made in October 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Sales of Proved Reserves In 2016, Occidental sold 46 million BOE in proved reserves mainly related to Libya and Piceance.
797468_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2016 , Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 195 million BOE mainly from Permian Basin improved recovery and purchases.
797468_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	and 47 million BOE of negative price and price related revisions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	Permian Basin and Oman accounted for approximately 89 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Occidental incurred approximately $0.5 billion in 2016 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	A substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 , was the result of the development program in the Permian Basin, which represents 75 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Reserves Evaluation and Review Process Occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2016 , were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.
797468_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	The Senior Vice President has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe.
797468_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.
797468_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Classification.
797468_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In 2016 , Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2016 , in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2016 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	In 2016 , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 18 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P84_S5	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Average annual WTI and Brent oil price indexes for 2016 were below the 2015 averages, but ended the year higher, closing at $53.72 per barrel and $56.82 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Commodity prices remained relatively constant in early 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Although United States economic growth in 2016 lagged behind that of 2015, demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks remained fairly constant as natural gas and ethylene pricing was lower on average than in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Historically high planned and unplanned ethylene outages, resulting in price volatility within the spot market, and rising energy costs in the last half of 2016 put pressure on chemical margins.
797468_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	The impact of energy and feedstock costs was partially offset by the end of 2016 as tighter supply in the caustic soda and PVC markets resulted in improved margins.
797468_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals In 2016, the United States economic growth rate was expected to be below the 2.6 percent experienced in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	The lower than expected U.S. growth rate tempered domestic demand as the 2016 industry chlorine operating rate increased by only 1 percent, to 84 percent, resulting in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were relatively strong in 2016 as United States ethylene and energy costs were advantaged over global pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	Liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in the last three quarters of 2016 as new capacity growth in the United States slowed.
797468_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	over-year 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their year-over-year increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling.
797468_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	PVC industry operating rates in 2016 were approximately 2.3 percent higher than 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	Industry PVC margins declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015, as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Long-term weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental s products that are consumed by industry participants.
797468_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Further strengthening of the U.S. dollar may cause headwinds in the U.S. commodity export market.
797468_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Basic Chemicals Continued improvement in the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	Overall, the low chlor-alkali operating rates driven by capacity increases over the last few years should improve as the pace of expansions have slowed considerably both domestically and globally.
797468_17_ITEM7_P99_S3	Improved 2016 margins from historically low values in 2015 are expected to continue as long as United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remain favorable compared to global feedstock costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P99_S4	Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to be challenged but are expected to improve as oil prices rise.
797468_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Vinyls North American demand should improve slightly in 2017 over 2016 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	North American operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2016 but margins should improve as demand in the United States strengthens.
797468_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing business and its processing, transportation and power generation assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	The marketing business aggregates and markets Occidental's and third-party volumes and engages in storage activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2016 were significantly higher than those in 2015, primarily due to impairments taken in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	unfavorable contract pricing on long-term supply agreements as well as unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, decreased throughput and lower realized NGLs pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Business Review Pipeline Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy.
797468_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, and up to 2.5 Bcf per day in the summer.
797468_17_ITEM7_P105_S3	Dolphin Pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity.
797468_17_ITEM7_P105_S4	Occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the Dolphin Pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows.
797468_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,900 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin in west Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 7.1 million barrels of active storage capability and 128 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_17_ITEM7_P106_S2	Occidental's 2016 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2015 due to lower throughput volumes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Occidental s 2016 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2015 due to lower realized NGL pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Occidental, together with ADNOC, developed Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, of which Occidental has a 40-percent participating interest.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	Al Hosn Gas is designed to process 1.0 Bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, NGLs and sulfur.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	The processing facilities include processing and treatment facilities, sulfur recovery units, including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S3	The facilities produce approximately 10,000 tons per day of sulfur, of which approximately 4,000 tons is Occidental's share.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S4	Gas facilities generates revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur.
797468_17_ITEM7_P109_S5	The decrease in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sulfur pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	increase in earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 was a result of higher production due to fewer outages.
797468_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	Marketing The marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity.
797468_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Occidental s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Marketing performance in 2016 declined compared to 2015 due to unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast crude oil price differentials.
797468_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Marketing results can have significant volatile results depending on significant price swings, as well as Permian to Gulf Coast crude oil differentials.
797468_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	Occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders.
797468_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGLs prices, which cannot reasonably be predicted.
797468_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	Generally, higher NGLs prices result in higher profitability.
797468_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	The statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
797468_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014 because of the spin-off from Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	See footnotes following significant transactions and events affecting Occidental's earnings.
797468_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount.
797468_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	(b) The 2016 gain on sale of assets included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	The 2014 amount represented the gain on sale of the Hugoton properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P122_S3	(c) The 2015 amount included approximately $1.6 billion of impairment and related charges associated with non-core domestic oil and gas assets in the Williston Basin (sold in November 2015) and Piceance Basin sold in March 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P122_S4	The remaining 2015 charges were mainly associated with the decline in commodity prices and management changes to future development plans.

797468_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	Oil and gas segment results were losses of $0.6 billion and $8.1 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and income of $0.4 billion in 2014.

797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	Oil and gas segment results in 2015 included pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion on domestic and international assets, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S3	Approximately $1.3 billion of the domestic impairment and related charges were due to the exit of Occidental s operations in the Williston Basin, which was sold in November 2015 and in the Piceance Basin, which was sold in March 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S4	The remaining domestic charges were due to the significant decline in the futures price curve as well as management s decision not to pursue development activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S5	Internationally, the impairments and related charges were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce our exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S6	Earnings in 2014 included pre-tax charges of $5.3 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of Hugoton assets.

797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S8	Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in domestic oil and gas results in 2016, compared to 2015, reflected significantly lower realized oil prices, which had decreased by 13 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and higher DD A rates.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S9	To a lesser extent, the lower 2016 results also reflected lower oil volumes due to the sale of non-core domestic operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P127_S10	The decrease in results compared to 2015 were partially offset by lower cash operating expenses.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	lower realized crude oil prices, which had decreased by 23 percent in the Middle East and 16 percent in Latin America partially offset by lower DD A rates.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	Average production costs for 2016, excluding taxes other than on income, were $10.76 per BOE, compared to $11.57 per BOE for 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S2	The decrease in average costs reflected lower maintenance, workover and support costs as a result of improvements in operating efficiencies, especially in the domestic operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S3	Average daily production volumes were 630,000 BOE and 668,000 BOE for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and included production from assets sold or exited of 28,000 BOE and 103,000 BOE for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S5	The increase in production from on-going operations mainly reflected higher production from Al Hosn Gas as it was not fully operational in 2015 and higher production from Permian Resources, which increased its 2016 production by 13 percent compared to 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S6	These increases were offset by lower production from South Texas and Other due to curtailed drilling.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S7	In addition to the impairments and related charges noted above, the decrease in domestic oil and gas segment results in 2015, compared to 2014, reflected significantly lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and lower operating costs from lower workover and maintenance costs and lower DD A expenses.
797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S8	The decrease in international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes.

797468_17_ITEM7_P128_S13	The decrease in average costs reflected decreased activity in downhole maintenance and lower overall cost structure.
797468_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $571 million, $542 million and $420 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	Included in 2016 earnings are a pre-tax gain on sale of $57 million from the sale of the Occidental Tower building in Dallas and a $31 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a non-core specialty chemicals business.
797468_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Excluding these significant items, the decrease in 2016 earnings, compared to 2015, reflected lower PVC margins as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing, which was partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Segment earnings for 2014 included asset impairments of $149 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	Excluding these significant items, the decrease in 2015 earnings, compared to 2014 reflected lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volumes across most products, offset by improved PVC margins resulting primarily from lower energy and ethylene costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	Midstream and marketing segment results were losses of $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and earnings of $2.6 billion in 2014.

797468_17_ITEM7_P132_S3	Included in 2014 earnings were $2.0 billion of gains from the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and part of Occidental's investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_17_ITEM7_P132_S4	Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in 2016 results compared to 2015 reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable contract pricing on long-term supply agreements as well as unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, decreased throughput and lower realized NGLs pricing.
797468_17_ITEM7_P132_S5	Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in 2015 results, compared to 2014, primarily reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of the Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, lower domestic gas processing income due to lower NGL prices and lower Dolphin Pipeline income and the decrease in Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline.
797468_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $2.3 billion, were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	(a) Represents amounts attributable to income from continuing operations after deducting a non-controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014.
797468_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	The non-controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings.
797468_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	Occidental's 2016 worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent, which is higher than the 2015 rate mainly due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income, tax credits and tax benefits resulting from the write off of exploration blocks.
797468_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	Excluding the impact of impairments and other nonrecurring items, Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate for 2016 would be 24 percent.
797468_17_ITEM7_P136_S2	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is Occidental s intention to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_17_ITEM7_P136_S3	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $116 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of continuing operations are discussed below:
797468_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	The decrease in net sales in 2016 , compared to 2015 , was mainly due to the decline in average worldwide realized oil prices in 2016 and a decline in worldwide production as Occidental exited non-core areas.
797468_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	Average worldwide realized oil prices fell by approximately 18 percent from 2015 to 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P138_S2	The decrease in net sales in 2015 , compared to 2014 , was due to a significant decline in worldwide oil, NGLs and gas prices, partially offset by higher domestic and international crude oil volumes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	prices fell by nearly 50 percent and NYMEX gas prices fell by over 35 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment sales which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	The 2016 gain on sale included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties, the Occidental Tower building in Dallas, and a non-core specialty chemicals business.

797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	Cost of sales decreased in 2016 from the prior year due primarily to lower oil and gas maintenance costs and lower chemical feedstock and energy costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	Cost of sales decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to lower energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment, lower fuel costs in the power generation operations and lower worldwide production costs, including workovers and downhole maintenance costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S2	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a lower compensation accruals in 2015 related to Occidental's decision not to pay bonuses.
797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S3	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to lower compensation expense.
797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S4	DD A expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, due to lower volumes from the exited non-core oil and gas operations and lower DD A rates in the Middle East.
797468_17_ITEM7_P141_S5	DD A expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014 due to higher production volumes partially offset by lower DD A rates.
797468_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	In 2016, Occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of $825 million, of which $541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and $160 million for the termination of crude oil supply contracts, $78 million related to the disposal of CRC stock and $61 million related to exits from Libya and Iraq.
797468_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	Asset impairments and related items in 2015 of $10.2 billion included charges of $3.5 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to Occidental s exit from the Williston and Piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.
797468_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	International oil and gas charges of $5.0 billion were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	Midstream charges of $1.3 billion included the impairment of Occidental s Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $227 million for its available for sale investment in California Resources.

797468_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to lower production taxes, which are directly tied to lower commodity prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	Taxes other than on income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due primarily to lower oil, NGL and gas prices, which resulted in lower ad valorem and severance taxes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	The benefit from income taxes decreased in 2016 from the prior year as a result of a lower net loss in 2016, compared to 2015, which reflected significant impairments and related items charges.
797468_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	The provision for income taxes decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to the pre-tax loss in 2015 as a result of the lower price environment and impairments and related charges.
797468_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	The decline in income from equity investments in 2016 from 2015 is the result of lower Dolphin gas sales.
797468_17_ITEM7_P145_S3	The decline in 2015 from 2014 is a result of the lower Dolphin gas sales, Occidental's reduced ownership in Plains Pipeline and the expiration of Occidental's contract in Yemen Block 10, where Occidental held an equity interest.
797468_17_ITEM7_P145_S4	Discontinued operations, net in 2016 and 2015 of $428 and $317 million, respectively, primarily include settlement payments by the Republic of Ecuador.

797468_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	The increase in trade receivables, net, was the result of improved oil and gas prices at the end of 2016, compared to the end of 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	Average December WTI and Brent prices were below $40.00 per barrel in 2015 compared to over $50.00 per barrel in 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S2	Inventories decreased as a result of lower materials and supplies inventories in the oil and gas segment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S3	The decrease in assets held for sale is the result of the sale of Piceance oil and gas properties and the Dallas Tower office building.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S4	Other current assets increased as a result of receivables recorded for federal and state tax refunds anticipated on the net loss carryback.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S5	The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture, which were partially offset by distributions from Dolphin Energy and Plains All American Pipeline Company.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S6	The decrease in the available for sale investment is due to the complete distribution of Occidental's retained interest in California Resources as a special stock dividend in the first quarter of 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P148_S7	The increase in PP E, net, was due to capital expenditures and the fourth quarter Permian acquisitions, which were partially offset by DD A.
797468_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity The increase in accounts payable reflected higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	Liabilities of assets held for sale were transferred with the sale of the Piceance properties in the first quarter of 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes was due to the decrease in the difference between the book and tax basis of Occidental's oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to the additional asset retirement obligation (ARO) recorded related to the Permian acquisitions and newly drilled wells and additional environmental liabilities recorded for Maxus indemnified sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	The decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends and the 2016 net loss.
797468_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2016 , Occidental had approximately $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

797468_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments and through future borrowings, and if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 decreased $0.7 billion to $2.5 billion, from $3.3 billion in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide average realized oil prices in the first half of 2016, which on a year-over-year basis declined 18 percent.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S2	The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs, especially in the oil and gas segment where year over year production costs decreased by 7 percent.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S3	Cash flows from continuing operations in 2016 also included collections of $325 million of federal and state tax refunds.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S4	The usage of working capital in 2016 reflected an increase in receivables as oil prices were much higher at the end of 2016, compared to the end of 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S5	Operating cash flows from discontinued operations reflected the collection of the Ecuador settlement.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S6	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 decreased $5.6 billion to $3.3 billion, from $8.9 billion in 2014.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S7	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide realized oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices throughout 2015, which on a year-over-year basis declined 48 percent, 57 percent, and 42 percent, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S8	The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by higher production and lower operating costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S9	The usage of working capital in 2015 reflected lower realized prices that impacted receivable collections and payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM7_P159_S10	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	The chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	Occidental s net capital expenditures declined by $2.7 billion in 2016 to $2.9 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	The decline was a result of the oil and gas budget reduction due to lower commodity price environment and reductions in spending on long-term projects such as the OxyChem Ingleside facility, which is expected to come on line in early 2017.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S2	Occidental's net capital expenditures declined $3.1 billion in 2015 to $5.6 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility which was included in other investing activities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S3	The decline was the result of lower spending in oil and gas non-core operations in the United States and Middle East and reduced expenditures on long-term projects coming on line at the end of 2014.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S4	While the 2017 environment remains challenging, Occidental remains committed to allocating capital to only its highest return projects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S5	Occidental's 2017 capital spending is expected to be in the range of $3.0 billion to $3.6 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S6	In 2016, cash flows used in other investing activities of $2.0 billion is comprised primarily of the acquisition of acreage in the Permian in October 2016.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S7	In 2015, cash flows used in other investing activities of $0.1 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P161_S8	Capital commitments for long-term projects currently under construction in the midstream and chemicals segment in 2017 are planned to be approximately $140 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $0.4 billion, as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of $1.5 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S1	Financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from long term debt of $4.2 billion and payments of long term debt of $2.7 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S2	Occidental used restricted cash of $1.2 billion to pay dividends and retire debt.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S3	Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $1.5 billion, as compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 of $2.2 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S4	Financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from long term debt of $1.5 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P162_S5	Occidental used restricted cash of $2.8 billion to pay dividends and purchase treasury stock.
797468_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of Occidental's off-balance-sheet arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	Guarantees Occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $296 million of Dolphin s debt.
797468_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	Occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit, indemnities and commitments.
797468_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Qatar" and Segment Results of Operations for further information about Dolphin.
797468_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	Occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility.
797468_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	Lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
797468_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	The table below summarizes and cross-references Occidental s contractual obligations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	This summary indicates on- and off-balance-sheet obligations as of December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	(b) Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, accrued transportation commitments and other accrued liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	(c) Amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, drilling rigs and services, CO 2, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_17_ITEM7_P168_S2	Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P168_S3	Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.7 percent discount rate.
797468_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	Delivery Commitments Occidental has commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	The domestic volumes contracted to be delivered, which are not presented in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements, are approximately 81 million barrels of oil through 2025, 5 Bcf of gas through 2017 and 11 million barrels of NGLs through 2018.
797468_17_ITEM7_P169_S2	The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
797468_17_ITEM7_P169_S3	Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.
797468_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S1	Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S2	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S3	In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S4	In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy these criteria.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S5	Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation, that satisfy these criteria as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental s consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S6	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P171_S7	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.
797468_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	Tax Matters During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_17_ITEM7_P173_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS review.
797468_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	Indemnities to Third Parties Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	As of December 31, 2016, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P178_S3	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 147 sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($131 million in 2016, $70 million in 2015, and $79 million in 2014) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ($739 million in 2016, $316 million in 2015, and $255 million in 2014).
797468_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL) sites and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	described above, and 88 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	As of December 31, 2016, three sites the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio(both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S3	Four of the 68 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 53 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S4	The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S5	Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, and Texas accounted for 48 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P181_S6	Six other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 69 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware.
797468_17_ITEM7_P182_S2	Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.
797468_17_ITEM7_P182_S3	Occidental is pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of Maxus, to recover all indemnified costs, which will include costs to be incurred at the Site.
797468_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.
797468_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.
797468_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P184_S1	The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites.
797468_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $1.0 billion.
797468_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	Environmental Costs Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P190_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $89 million for 2017 .
797468_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_17_ITEM7_P191_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $9.5 billion, or 22 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_17_ITEM7_P191_S2	Of such assets, approximately $8.2 billion are located in the Middle East and approximately $1.0 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_17_ITEM7_P191_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , net sales outside North America totaled $3.7 billion, or approximately 37 percent of total net sales.
797468_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_17_ITEM7_P192_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_17_ITEM7_P192_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_17_ITEM7_P192_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_17_ITEM7_P193_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P195_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_17_ITEM7_P195_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_17_ITEM7_P195_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_17_ITEM7_P196_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_17_ITEM7_P196_S2	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_17_ITEM7_P197_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S5	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S6	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S7	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S8	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_17_ITEM7_P199_S9	In 2016 , positive revisions of previous estimates of 159 million BOE were primarily positive technical revisions in Al Hosn Gas and price revisions in Oman due to the PSC impact, partially offset by negative domestic price revisions.
797468_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P200_S1	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P200_S2	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	It is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
797468_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate.
797468_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $140 million annually at current production rates.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_17_ITEM7_P205_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S0	Chemical Assets Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_17_ITEM7_P206_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_17_ITEM7_P207_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P208_S0	loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_17_ITEM7_P208_S1	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.4 billion and its depreciation expense for 2017 is expected to be approximately $300 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P208_S2	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_17_ITEM7_P208_S3	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $45 million per year.
797468_17_ITEM7_P209_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_17_ITEM7_P210_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_17_ITEM7_P210_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_17_ITEM7_P211_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_17_ITEM7_P211_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P212_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_17_ITEM7_P213_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_17_ITEM7_P213_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
797468_17_ITEM7_P214_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_17_ITEM7_P215_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_17_ITEM7_P215_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P216_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_17_ITEM7_P217_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_17_ITEM7_P217_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_17_ITEM7_P218_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P218_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_17_ITEM7_P219_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P219_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_17_ITEM7_P219_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_17_ITEM7_P219_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_17_ITEM7_P220_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_17_ITEM7_P220_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_17_ITEM7_P221_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_17_ITEM7_P221_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_17_ITEM7_P222_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_17_ITEM7_P222_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_17_ITEM7_P223_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_17_ITEM7_P223_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S0	operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_17_ITEM7_P224_S7	Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis.
797468_17_ITEM7_P225_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_17_ITEM7_P225_S1	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_17_ITEM7_P225_S2	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_17_ITEM7_P226_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_17_ITEM7_P226_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_17_ITEM7_P227_S0	such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_17_ITEM7_P228_S0	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_17_ITEM7_P228_S1	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_17_ITEM7_P229_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_17_ITEM7_P229_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $87 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P229_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $87 million.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S1	Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S4	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S5	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.
797468_17_ITEM7_P230_S6	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_17_ITEM7_P231_S0	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES See Note 3, Accounting and Disclosure Changes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
797468_17_ITEM7_P232_S0	SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2, "Business and Properties," Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.
797468_17_ITEM7_P233_S0	"goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements.
797468_17_ITEM7_P233_S1	You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
797468_17_ITEM7_P233_S2	Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
797468_17_ITEM7_P234_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $120 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGLs prices.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $50 million.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S8	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P0_S9	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	According to IHS Chemical or Townsend, 2016 average contract prices were: chlorine $298 per ton; caustic soda $645 per ton; and PVC $0.38 per lb.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management of various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Fair Value of Marketing Derivative Contracts Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	At December 31, 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P8_S3	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P15_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $36 million and debt issuance cost of $52 million.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S2	Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S3	Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S4	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S6	As of December 31, 2016 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties.
797468_17_ITEM7A_P16_S7	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2016 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation:
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts.
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
797468_17_ITEM8_P2_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental Petroleum Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Occidental Petroleum Corporation:
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Occidental Petroleum Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_17_ITEM8_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

797468_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	As a result of the spin-off of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) the statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
797468_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources for additional information.
797468_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	Revenues from the production of oil and gas properties in which Occidental has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Occidental s net revenue interest.
797468_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Revenue from marketing activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Revenue from all marketing activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement.
797468_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 , and net sales of approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss, delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash is the result of the separation of California Resources in 2014.
797468_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , there was $1.2 billion of cash restricted for the payment of dividends, payment of debt or share repurchases.
797468_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	In 2016, Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends.
797468_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	A decline in market value of any available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, Occidental considers all available information relevant to the investment, including past events and current conditions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P34_S4	Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.
797468_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	INVENTORIES Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_17_ITEM8_P35_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_17_ITEM8_P38_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis.
797468_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	See Note 15 and below for further discussion of asset impairments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_17_ITEM8_P47_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to fifty years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_17_ITEM8_P48_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - using unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	IMPAIRMENTS AND RELATED ITEMS In 2016, Occidental recorded net impairment and related charges of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq and the termination of crude oil supply contracts at a cost of $160 million.
797468_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	The corporate amount included an allowance for doubtful accounts.
797468_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	In 2015, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges on oil and gas assets due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the decision to sell or exit non-core assets and changes in development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota and in December 2015, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado.
797468_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	In Iraq, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal and reassigned its interest in the Zubair Field in accordance with the contract terms.
797468_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	In Bahrain, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal, reassigning its interest, and completed the exit in 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P53_S4	In Yemen, Occidental s non-operated interest in Block 10 East Shabwa Field expired in December 2015, and in February 2016, Occidental sold its interests in Block S-1, An Nagyah Field.
797468_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	In 2015, the midstream and marketing segment recorded an impairment charge for the Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	In 2014, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges mainly for Williston, Bahrain, the Joslyn oil sands project and other non-core domestic gas properties due to declining prices and changes in development plans.
797468_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	(a) A portion of the 2015 charges are reported in the Midstream and Marketing segment.
797468_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	It is reasonably possible that prolonged or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace, or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $341 million and $188 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_17_ITEM8_P64_S7	Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis.
797468_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Many factors could affect Occidental's future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_17_ITEM8_P66_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_17_ITEM8_P66_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_17_ITEM8_P67_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1.2 billion is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs) and capital employed incentive awards and return on assets (ROCEI/ROAI), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock and the estimated payout at the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	For total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from a Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	Compensation expense for RSUs, ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S3	Compensation expense for the dividends accrued on unvested awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria, if applicable.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S4	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_17_ITEM8_P78_S5	The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, which are more fully described in Note 13, in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion , $1.0 billion and $2.9 billion during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately $343 million , $445 million and $610 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States.
797468_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	Interest paid totaled approximately $312 million , $246 million and $219 million , net of capitalized interest of $64 million , $138 million and $180 million , for the years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars.
797468_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income.
797468_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.

797468_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2018.
797468_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	Under the new standard, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services.
797468_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	The new standard also requires more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
797468_17_ITEM8_P104_S4	Occidental will not early adopt the standard, and plans to use a modified retrospective approach upon adoption, with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application subject to certain additional disclosures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	Occidental has started the assessment process by evaluating its revenue streams and evaluating contracts under the revised standards.
797468_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	Occidental is currently evaluating the impact the standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	These rules are designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting and cash flow classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (2) forfeitures, and (3) tax withholding requirements and cash flow classification.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The rules were adopted for the second quarter of 2016 and did not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S3	In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to eliminate the requirement to retrospectively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S4	The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S5	The rules became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S6	The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S7	In March 2016, the FASB issued rules clarifying that a change in one of the parties to a derivative contract that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require dedesignation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S8	The rules became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P106_S9	These rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued rules which require Occidental to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet.
797468_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	The new rules require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
797468_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	The lease liability represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for most leases.
797468_17_ITEM8_P107_S3	The guidance retains the current accounting for lessors and does not make significant changes to the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows by a lessee.
797468_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	Occidental is the lessee under various agreements for real estate, equipment, plants and facilities, aircraft, and vehicles that are currently accounted for as operating leases, refer to Note 6, Lease Commitments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	As a result, these new rules will increase reported assets and liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S2	Occidental will not early adopt this standard.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S3	Occidental will apply the revised lease rules for our interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach, including several optional practical expedients related to leases commenced before the effective date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S4	Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements and has started the assessment process by evaluating the population of leases under the revised definition.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S5	The quantitative impacts of the new standard are dependent on the leases in force at the time of adoption.
797468_17_ITEM8_P109_S6	As a result, the evaluation of the effect of the new standards will extend over future periods.
797468_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued rules simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	The new rules require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
797468_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	Occidental adopted these rules retrospectively as of January 1, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P110_S3	These rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately $192 million and $189 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Long-term debt consisted of the following:
797468_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2019.
797468_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility.
797468_17_ITEM8_P113_S2	Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit.
797468_17_ITEM8_P113_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_17_ITEM8_P113_S4	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2016 on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility.
797468_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur.
797468_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt.
797468_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	In November 2016, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, comprised of $750 million of 3.0-percent senior notes due 2027 and $750 million of 4.1-percent senior notes due 2047.
797468_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of $1.49 billion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August each year for each series of senior notes beginning August 15, 2017.
797468_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	Occidental will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior notes offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046.
797468_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P118_S2	In February 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that matured.
797468_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $296 million and $318 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt.
797468_17_ITEM8_P119_S2	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	At December 31, 2016 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $9.9 billion, of which zero is due in 2017, $0.5 billion is due in 2018, $0.1 billion is due in 2019, zero is due in 2020, $1.3 billion is due in 2021 and $8 billion is due in 2022 and thereafter.
797468_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $10.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $9.8 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.
797468_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space.
797468_17_ITEM8_P123_S1	Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses.
797468_17_ITEM8_P123_S2	At December 31, 2016 , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:
797468_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	Rental expense for operating leases was $237 million in 2016 , $197 million in 2015 and $155 million in 2014 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts, including those designated as cash flow hedges, to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, transportation commitments and to fix margins on the future sale of stored volumes of oil and natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Where Occidental buys product for its own consumption or sells its production to a defined customer, Occidental elects normal purchases and normal sales exclusions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Occidental usually applies cash flow hedge accounting treatment to derivative financial instruments to lock in margins on the forecasted sales of its natural gas storage volumes, and at times for other strategies to lock in margins.
797468_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	Occidental also enters into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes; however, the results of any transactions are immaterial to the marketing portfolio.
797468_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_17_ITEM8_P127_S3	The financial instruments, not designated as hedges, will impact Occidental's earnings through mark-to-market until the offsetting future physical commodity is delivered.
797468_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	For GAAP purposes, any physical inventory is carried at lower of cost or market on the balance sheet.
797468_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	A substantial majority of Occidental's physical derivative contracts are index-based and carry no mark-to-market value in earnings.
797468_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	Net gains and losses associated with derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in net sales.
797468_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	Net gains and losses attributable to derivatives instruments subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings.
797468_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s leased storage facilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM8_P131_S2	As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM8_P131_S3	The amount of cash-flow hedges, including the ineffective portion was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts reported in net sales related to the outstanding commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:
797468_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Fair Value of Derivatives Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - using unobservable inputs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	(b) These amounts do not include collateral.
797468_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	As of December 31, 2016, collateral received of $4 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $13 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
797468_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $25 million as of December 31, 2016, deposited by Occidental, has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables.
797468_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	These amounts do not include collateral.
797468_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements and presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	(b) These amounts do not include collateral.
797468_17_ITEM8_P136_S2	As of December 31, 2015, collateral received of $14 million has been netted against derivative assets and collateral paid of $4 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
797468_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $3 million as of December 31, 2015, deposited by Occidental, has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables.
797468_17_ITEM8_P137_S2	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P137_S3	These amounts do not include collateral.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S1	Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S2	Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S3	Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S4	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_17_ITEM8_P138_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was immaterial for both December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 147 sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities other ($739 million in 2016, $316 million in 2015, and $255 million in 2014).
797468_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA NPL sites and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 16 of the 147 sites described above, and 88 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	As of December 31, 2016, three sites the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S2	The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S3	Four of the 68 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 53 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S4	The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S5	Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, and Texas accounted for 48 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P145_S6	Six other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 69 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware.
797468_17_ITEM8_P146_S2	Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.
797468_17_ITEM8_P146_S3	Occidental is pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of Maxus, to recover all indemnified costs, which will include costs to be incurred at the Site.
797468_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.
797468_17_ITEM8_P147_S1	The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.
797468_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million.
797468_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites.
797468_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P149_S2	Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P150_S1	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_17_ITEM8_P150_S2	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $1.0 billion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM8_P153_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S3	Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S5	In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S6	In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S7	Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation, that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental s consolidated balance sheets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S8	Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P154_S9	Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.
797468_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P156_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_17_ITEM8_P156_S2	Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS review.
797468_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	As of December 31, 2016, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P160_S2	At December 31, 2016 , total purchase obligations were $8.9 billion, which included approximately $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion, $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion that will be paid in 2017 , 2018 , 2019 , 2020 and 2021 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P160_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2017 and thereafter, which were approximately $0.5 billion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	Total deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S2	The reduction in the net deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to the addition of deferred tax benefits associated with various tax credit carryforwards as well as a net reduction in the deferred tax asset related to the allowance for bad debts.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S3	Occidental had, as of December 31, 2016 , foreign tax credit carryforward of $2.0 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2026, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2036.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S4	In addition, Occidental had, as of December 31, 2016, alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $226 million, that do not expire, and $186 million of general business credit carryforwards that expire between 2023 and 2036.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S5	Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S6	A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $8.5 billion, net of foreign taxes, at December 31, 2016 , as it is Occidental s intention to reinvest such earnings permanently.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S7	If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $116 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S8	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $249 million, $1 million, and $454 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S9	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $22 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P165_S10	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount.
797468_17_ITEM8_P166_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	Occidental has recognized $761 million and $297 million in income tax receivables at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded in other current assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods.
797468_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters.
797468_17_ITEM8_P169_S0	Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P170_S0	The following is a summary of common stock issuances:

797468_17_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31:
797468_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax amounts:
797468_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	(a) See Note 13 for further information.
797468_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	Occidental has established several plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards including in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	An aggregate of 35 million shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 4.5 million shares had been allocated to employee awards through December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	In accordance with the terms of the shareholder approved 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), awards issued under the superseded 2005 LTIP and subsequently forfeited after adoption of the 2015 LTIP increase the shares available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP.
797468_17_ITEM8_P177_S1	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 30 million shares were available for grants of future awards.
797468_17_ITEM8_P177_S2	The plan requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_17_ITEM8_P177_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 30 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_17_ITEM8_P177_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash, including awards that were issued under a previous plan that remain outstanding.
797468_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	During 2016 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 23,888 shares of common stock.
797468_17_ITEM8_P178_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the closing quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
797468_17_ITEM8_P178_S2	The following table summarizes total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31:
797468_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards was $231 million.
797468_17_ITEM8_P179_S1	This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	RSUs Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria based on net income or earnings per share, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S2	These awards vest from one to four years following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S3	For certain RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S4	For those awards that cliff vest between one to three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting or performance period, as appropriate, and are paid upon vesting or performance certification, as appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $75.57, $72.64, and $100.95 per share, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S6	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were $74.82, $72.54, and $101.77, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S7	Cash-Settled RSUs resulted in payments of $41 million, $39 million, and $64 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P180_S8	The fair value of RSUs settled in shares during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $31 million, $28 million, and $56 million, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented below:
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S0	TSRIs Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of a three-year period following the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	Payout is based upon Occidental's total shareholder return performance relative to its peers and the S P 500.
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S2	TSRIs granted in 2016 and 2015 have payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S3	TSRIs granted in July 2014 have payouts that range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award; all outstanding TSRIs settle fully in stock once certified.
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S4	Dividend equivalents for TSRIs are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.
797468_17_ITEM8_P182_S5	The fair value of TSRIs settled in shares during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $8 million, $14 million, and zero, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P185_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	A summary of Occidental s unvested TSRIs as of December 31, 2016 , and changes during the year ended December 31, 2016 , is presented below:
797468_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	(a) Presented at the target payouts.
797468_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) or Options that are settled in stock.
797468_17_ITEM8_P189_S1	Exercise prices of the Options were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P189_S2	No options were granted in 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	and 2014 was $1 million, zero, and $5 million, respectively.

797468_17_ITEM8_P190_S2	In 2015 and 2016 no cash based SAR awards were granted or outstanding.
797468_17_ITEM8_P191_S0	The fair value of each Option or stock-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_17_ITEM8_P191_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the vesting and expiration terms of the award.
797468_17_ITEM8_P191_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P192_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on US Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_17_ITEM8_P192_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_17_ITEM8_P192_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended December 31, 2016 :
797468_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	ROCEI / ROAI Occidental grants share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period if performance targets based on return on assets of the applicable segment or return on capital employed are certified as being met.
797468_17_ITEM8_P194_S1	These awards are settled in stock upon certification of the performance target, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_17_ITEM8_P194_S2	Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.
797468_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, level and employee contributions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P196_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_17_ITEM8_P196_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $163 million and $175 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $113 million in 2016 , $136 million in 2015 and $146 million in 2014 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 600 domestic and 1,100 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $182 million in 2016 , $200 million in 2015 and $215 million in 2014 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values:
797468_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans:
797468_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2017 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs:
797468_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $10 million and zero, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $15 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2016 and 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P207_S0	The assumed long term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
797468_17_ITEM8_P208_S0	In 2016, Occidental adopted the Society of Actuaries 2016 Mortality Improvement Scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined benefit retirement plans in the United States use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor s pension obligations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P208_S1	The new mortality improvement scale reflects additional data that the Social Security Administration has released since the 2014 Mortality Tables Report and Mortality Improvement Scale released in 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P208_S2	This additional data shows a lower degree of mortality improvement than previously reflected.
797468_17_ITEM8_P208_S3	The changes in the mortality improvement scale results in a decrease of $5 million and $19 million in the pension and postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_17_ITEM8_P209_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.0 percent to 10.8 percent at December 31, 2016 and from 1.5 percent to 10 percent at December 31, 2015 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P209_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.0 percent to 10.0 percent in 2016 , depending on local economic conditions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 1.97 percent and 1.60 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S1	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S2	For those union employees, Occidental projected that healthcare cost trend rates would decrease 0.25 percent per year from 6.50 percent in 2016 until they reach 4.50 percent in 2025, and remain at 4.50 percent thereafter.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S3	A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed healthcare cost trend rates would result in an increase of $44 million or a reduction of $36 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S4	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P210_S5	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	The investments are monitored by Occidental s Pension and Retirement Trust and Investment Committee (Investment Committee) in its role as fiduciary.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S2	The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S3	Equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S4	Other asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S5	The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P211_S6	Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
797468_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	(a) This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries.
797468_17_ITEM8_P213_S1	(b) This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P213_S2	(c) This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries.
797468_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	The activity during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , for the assets using Level 3 fair value measurements was insignificant.
797468_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	Occidental expects to contribute $3 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during 2017 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENTS As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of equity-method investments, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s equity investments consisted mainly of a 12-percent interest in Plains Pipeline, a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, and various other partnerships and joint ventures.
797468_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	Equity investments paid dividends of $224 million, $438 million, and $396 million to Occidental in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P216_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since they were acquired was immaterial.
797468_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $653 million, of which almost $537 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives.
797468_17_ITEM8_P217_S1	The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments:
797468_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a 24.5 -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment.
797468_17_ITEM8_P218_S1	In November 2014, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.7 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion.
797468_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESOURCES STOCK As part of Occidental's spin-off of its California oil and gas operations and related assets, Occidental retained 71.5 million shares of, or approximately 18.7 percent interest in, California Resources stock, which was recorded as an available for sale investment.
797468_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $227 million for this available for sale investment as of December 31, 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	At December 31, 2015, Occidental's available for sale investment in California Resources was $167 million.
797468_17_ITEM8_P219_S3	In March 2016, Occidental distributed a special stock dividend for all of its 71.5 million shares of common stock of California Resources to stockholders and recorded a $78 million loss to reduce the investment to its fair market value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P219_S4	Occidental no longer owns any shares of California Resources common stock.
797468_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time, Occidental purchases oil, NGLs, power, steam and chemicals from and sells oil, NGLs, natural gas, chemicals and power to certain of its equity investees and other related parties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the following amounts due from or to its related parties:
797468_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , sales of Occidental-produced oil and NGLs to Plains Pipeline accounted for 89 percent, 87 percent and 46 percent of these totals, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	Sales to Plains Pipeline related to Occidental's oil and gas production are disclosed above.
797468_17_ITEM8_P221_S2	In addition to these sales, Occidental conducts marketing activities with Plains Pipeline for oil, NGLs and transportation.
797468_17_ITEM8_P221_S3	Net margins associated with these marketing activities are negligible.
797468_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	In January 2012, Occidental entered into a long-term contract to purchase CO 2 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	This contract contains a price adjustment clause that is linked to changes in NYMEX crude oil prices.
797468_17_ITEM8_P222_S2	Occidental determined that the portion of this contract linked to NYMEX oil prices is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and Occidental therefore bifurcated this embedded pricing feature from its host contract and accounts for it at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	The following tables provide fair value measurement information for assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis:
797468_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	FAIR VALUES NONRECURRING During the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, Occidental recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $15 million related to proved oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P224_S1	As a result of the sharp decline of the forward price curve during 2015, as well as the decision to sell or exit non-core operations, Occidental recognized approximately $6.5 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to proved oil and gas properties.
797468_17_ITEM8_P224_S2	Internationally, Occidental recognized $4.7 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to $1.8 billion in charges in Oman, $1.3 billion in Iraq and Libya, $1 billion in Qatar, and $550 million in Colombia and Bolivia.

797468_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows.
797468_17_ITEM8_P225_S1	These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8-20 percent.
797468_17_ITEM8_P225_S2	These properties were impacted by persistently worldwide low oil and natural gas prices and changing management's development plans.
797468_17_ITEM8_P225_S3	Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
797468_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	In the fourth quarter 2015, Occidental recognized approximately $814 million in pre-tax impairment charges for a Midstream CO 2 treatment plant related to recurring CO 2 shortfalls and unpaid penalty fees.

797468_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	(b) Williston assets sold in November 2015, classified as held for sale and written down to the sales price at September 30, 2015.
797468_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and other on-balance sheet financial instruments, other than fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value.
797468_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	See Note 5 for the fair value of Long-term Debt.
797468_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	Occidental conducts its continuing operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing.
797468_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas.
797468_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO 2 and power.
797468_17_ITEM8_P231_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_17_ITEM8_P231_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P231_S3	Results of industry segments and geographic areas exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P233_S1	Corporate assets consist of cash and restricted cash, certain corporate receivables and PP E.

797468_17_ITEM8_P241_S1	Occidental shareholders at the close of business on the record date of November 17, 2014 received 0.4 shares of California Resources for every share of Occidental common stock held.
797468_17_ITEM8_P241_S2	In connection with the spin-off, California Resources distributed to Occidental $4.95 billion in restricted cash and $1.15 billion in unrestricted cash.

797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S0	The following tables set forth Occidental s net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of oil (including condensate), NGLs and natural gas and changes in such quantities.
797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S1	Proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S2	Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S3	For the 2016, 2015 and 2014 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $42.75, $50.28 and $94.99 per barrel, respectively.
797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S4	The calculated average Henry Hub natural gas prices for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $2.55, $2.66 and $4.42 per MMBtu, respectively.

797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S6	Estimated reserves include Occidental's economic interests under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other similar economic arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P244_S7	In addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.
797468_17_ITEM8_P245_S0	Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely.
797468_17_ITEM8_P245_S1	Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_17_ITEM8_P245_S2	Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.
797468_17_ITEM8_P246_S0	(a) A majority of the proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P246_S1	(b) Sales of proved reserves in 2016 were related to the sale of Libya.
797468_17_ITEM8_P246_S2	Sales of proved reserves in 2015 were related to the sale of Williston and exit from Iraq.

797468_17_ITEM8_P248_S6	(e) A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.
797468_17_ITEM8_P249_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_17_ITEM8_P250_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_17_ITEM8_P250_S2	For example, in 2016, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $43.32 per barrel and $2.42 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.

797468_17_ITEM8_P251_S1	(e) Approximately 7 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016 are nonproducing, primarily associated with Permian EOR.
797468_17_ITEM8_P251_S2	(f) A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.
797468_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	CAPITALIZED COSTS Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated DD A were as follows:
797468_17_ITEM8_P253_S0	(a) Includes acquisition costs, development costs, capitalized interest and asset retirement obligations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P254_S0	COSTS INCURRED Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, were as follows:

797468_17_ITEM8_P257_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_17_ITEM8_P258_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_17_ITEM8_P258_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_17_ITEM8_P258_S2	For example, in 2016, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $43.32 per barrel and $2.42 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.
797468_17_ITEM8_P259_S0	(b) Revenues are net of royalty payments.
797468_17_ITEM8_P259_S1	(c) United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead.
797468_17_ITEM8_P260_S0	For purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to Occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P260_S1	The realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P260_S2	Future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce proved reserves at year end.
797468_17_ITEM8_P261_S0	Future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows.
797468_17_ITEM8_P261_S1	The discount was computed by application of a 10 percent discount factor.
797468_17_ITEM8_P261_S2	The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P261_S3	Such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past.
797468_17_ITEM8_P261_S4	Other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results.
797468_17_ITEM8_P262_S0	The following table sets forth, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , Occidental s approximate average sales prices in continuing operations.
797468_17_ITEM8_P263_S0	Net Productive and Dry Exploratory and Development Wells Completed The following table sets forth, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , Occidental s net productive and dry exploratory and development wells completed.
797468_17_ITEM8_P264_S0	Productive Oil and Gas Wells The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s productive oil and gas wells (both producing and capable of production).
797468_17_ITEM8_P265_S0	(a) The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of wells with multiple completions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P265_S1	(b) The total number of wells in which interests are owned.
797468_17_ITEM8_P265_S2	(c) The sum of fractional interests.
797468_17_ITEM8_P266_S0	Participation in Exploratory and Development Wells Being Drilled The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s participation in exploratory and development wells being drilled.
797468_17_ITEM8_P267_S0	At December 31, 2016 , Occidental was participating in 109 pressure-maintenance projects, mostly waterfloods, in the United States, 13 in Latin America and 30 in the Middle East.
797468_17_ITEM8_P268_S0	The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s holdings of developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage.
797468_17_ITEM8_P269_S0	(a) Acres spaced or assigned to productive wells.
797468_17_ITEM8_P269_S1	(b) Total acres in which interests are held.
797468_17_ITEM8_P269_S2	(c) Sum of the fractional interests owned based on working interests, or interests under PSCs and other economic arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM8_P269_S3	(d) Acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves.
797468_17_ITEM8_P270_S0	Occidental s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases.
797468_17_ITEM8_P270_S1	Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.
797468_17_ITEM8_P270_S2	In some instances, Occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.
797468_17_ITEM8_P270_S3	In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions.
797468_17_ITEM8_P270_S4	Scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM8_P271_S0	The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM8_P271_S1	The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.
797468_17_ITEM8_P272_S0	(a) Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.
797468_17_ITEM8_P273_S0	Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.
797468_17_ITEM8_P273_S1	The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.
797468_17_ITEM8_P273_S2	For example, in 2016, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $43.32 per barrel and $2.42, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.
797468_17_ITEM8_P274_S0	Note : The amounts presented represent continuing operations.
797468_17_ITEM9_P0_S0	Occidental had no changes in, and no disagreements with, Occidental's accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
797468_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2016 , Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
797468_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based upon that evaluation, Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Occidental's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016 .
797468_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	There has been no change in Occidental's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Occidental's internal control over financial reporting.

797468_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2004, the mandatory disaggregation rules relating to the ESOP and non ESOP portions of the Plan shall not apply.

797468_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	By an amendment to the Plan, the Administrative Committee may elect to apply paragraphs (1) and (2) by using the Actual Deferral Percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year only if the current year testing method has been used for at least the last five Plan Years.
797468_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	If the Plan is aggregated with any other Qualified Plan, the Actual Deferral Percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year may be used only if the Plan is amended to so provide and each Qualified Plan that is aggregated with this Plan used the current year method for at least the last five years (or, if shorter, the period that such other Qualified Plan was in existence, including years in which the Qualified Plan was a portion of another Qualified Plan).
797468_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	(c) The restrictions of this section shall be based on the Participant s actual Testing Compensation while an Active Participant and total Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions allocated to the Participant s Account for the Plan Year.

797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S4	The amount of Excess Contributions attributable to each Highly Compensated Employees is the amount by which Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions, along with any other elective deferrals made to other qualified cash or deferred arrangements that are included in the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, must be reduced so that the Actual Deferral Percentage for that Highly Compensated Employee is reduced to the maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees.
797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S5	The maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees is determined by reducing the Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage for the Plan Year to the Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest Actual Deferral Percentage.
797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S6	If a lesser reduction would enable the ADP Test to be satisfied, only the lesser reduction is used to determine the maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage.
797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S7	This procedure is repeated until the ADP Test would be satisfied.
797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S8	The total amount of Excess Contributions to be corrected is equal to the sum of the dollar amounts computed under this subsection for each Highly Compensated Employee and is to be referred to as the Total Excess Contributions.

797468_17_ITEM15_P95_S12	This amount shall be allocated as the Excess Contribution for the Highly Compensated Employee, unless a smaller reduction, when added to the total dollar amount already allocated as Excess Contributions for other Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to this procedure equals the Total Excess Contributions for the Plan Year.

797468_17_ITEM15_P622_S0	Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
797468_17_ITEM15_P622_S1	The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 26, 2017 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P623_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM15_P624_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P625_S0	The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the state of Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in the Middle East.
797468_17_ITEM15_P626_S0	The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P626_S1	Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM15_P627_S0	Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.
797468_17_ITEM15_P627_S1	At Occidental s request and provided by Occidental, we have also presented the portion of the total company net proved reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.
797468_17_ITEM15_P628_S0	The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.
797468_17_ITEM15_P628_S1	All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
797468_17_ITEM15_P628_S2	Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE.
797468_17_ITEM15_P628_S3	It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.
797468_17_ITEM15_P629_S0	A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is the result of an investigation by a person who is qualified by experience and training equivalent to that of a Reserves Auditor to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.
797468_17_ITEM15_P630_S0	In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_17_ITEM15_P630_S1	Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, [and] (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.
797468_17_ITEM15_P631_S0	Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.
797468_17_ITEM15_P631_S1	Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.
797468_17_ITEM15_P632_S0	Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.
797468_17_ITEM15_P633_S0	The SEC defines reserves as the estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P633_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_17_ITEM15_P633_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_17_ITEM15_P633_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_17_ITEM15_P633_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.
797468_17_ITEM15_P634_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S1	If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S3	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S4	The SEC defines probable reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S5	The SEC defines possible reserves as those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.
797468_17_ITEM15_P635_S6	All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
797468_17_ITEM15_P636_S0	The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.
797468_17_ITEM15_P637_S0	Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.
797468_17_ITEM15_P637_S1	At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
797468_17_ITEM15_P638_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_17_ITEM15_P638_S1	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
797468_17_ITEM15_P638_S2	Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
797468_17_ITEM15_P639_S0	Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2016; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2016 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.
797468_17_ITEM15_P639_S1	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.
797468_17_ITEM15_P639_S2	Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.
797468_17_ITEM15_P640_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P640_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
797468_17_ITEM15_P641_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.
797468_17_ITEM15_P641_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
797468_17_ITEM15_P641_S2	These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
797468_17_ITEM15_P641_S3	Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
797468_17_ITEM15_P642_S0	The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.
797468_17_ITEM15_P642_S1	Approximately 13 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
797468_17_ITEM15_P642_S2	The remaining 87 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.
797468_17_ITEM15_P642_S3	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_17_ITEM15_P643_S0	Approximately 80 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.
797468_17_ITEM15_P643_S1	The remaining 20 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.
797468_17_ITEM15_P643_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_17_ITEM15_P644_S0	Of the properties reviewed, approximately 34 percent of the proved producing reserves and 73 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques.
797468_17_ITEM15_P644_S1	These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO 2 injection and infill drilling.
797468_17_ITEM15_P645_S0	Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.
797468_17_ITEM15_P645_S1	Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.
797468_17_ITEM15_P645_S2	The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
797468_17_ITEM15_P646_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
797468_17_ITEM15_P647_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_17_ITEM15_P647_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
797468_17_ITEM15_P648_S0	The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2016 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.
797468_17_ITEM15_P649_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_17_ITEM15_P649_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
797468_17_ITEM15_P650_S0	The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s average realized prices.
797468_17_ITEM15_P650_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
797468_17_ITEM15_P650_S2	A summary of average realized prices are not included for properties located in the Middle East because of host government s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.
797468_17_ITEM15_P651_S0	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
797468_17_ITEM15_P652_S0	As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
797468_17_ITEM15_P652_S1	The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.
797468_17_ITEM15_P652_S2	We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P653_S0	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.
797468_17_ITEM15_P654_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.
797468_17_ITEM15_P654_S1	The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.
797468_17_ITEM15_P655_S0	Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_17_ITEM15_P655_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
797468_17_ITEM15_P655_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
797468_17_ITEM15_P655_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
797468_17_ITEM15_P655_S4	The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P656_S0	Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
797468_17_ITEM15_P656_S1	The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S1	The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S2	As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S4	Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
797468_17_ITEM15_P657_S5	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2016, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
797468_17_ITEM15_P658_S0	Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
797468_17_ITEM15_P658_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
797468_17_ITEM15_P658_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
797468_17_ITEM15_P659_S0	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
797468_17_ITEM15_P660_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
797468_17_ITEM15_P660_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P660_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
797468_17_ITEM15_P660_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_17_ITEM15_P661_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S0	The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S3	Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S4	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
797468_17_ITEM15_P662_S5	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
797468_17_ITEM15_P663_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.
797468_17_ITEM15_P664_S0	Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P664_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.
797468_17_ITEM15_P664_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.
797468_17_ITEM15_P665_S0	We have not made any field examination of the properties.
797468_17_ITEM15_P665_S1	No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
797468_17_ITEM15_P666_S0	Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.
797468_17_ITEM15_P667_S0	Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.
797468_17_ITEM15_P667_S1	In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
797468_17_ITEM15_P667_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.
797468_17_ITEM15_P667_S3	We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P668_S0	We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.
797468_17_ITEM15_P668_S1	Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.
797468_17_ITEM15_P669_S0	We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
797468_17_ITEM15_P670_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2016.
797468_17_ITEM15_P671_S0	Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

797468_17_ITEM15_P687_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
797468_17_ITEM15_P687_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
797468_17_ITEM15_P687_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
797468_17_ITEM15_P688_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
797468_17_ITEM15_P688_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
797468_17_ITEM15_P689_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P689_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
797468_17_ITEM15_P689_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
797468_17_ITEM15_P689_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
797468_17_ITEM15_P689_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
797468_17_ITEM15_P690_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
797468_17_ITEM15_P690_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
797468_17_ITEM15_P691_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
797468_17_ITEM15_P692_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
797468_17_ITEM15_P692_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
797468_17_ITEM15_P692_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
797468_17_ITEM15_P692_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
797468_17_ITEM15_P693_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P694_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
797468_17_ITEM15_P695_S0	Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
797468_17_ITEM15_P695_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
797468_17_ITEM15_P696_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
797468_17_ITEM15_P697_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
797468_17_ITEM15_P698_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
797468_17_ITEM15_P699_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
797468_17_ITEM15_P699_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
797468_17_ITEM15_P700_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
797468_17_ITEM15_P700_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
797468_17_ITEM15_P700_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
797468_17_ITEM15_P701_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_17_ITEM15_P702_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_17_ITEM15_P702_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
797468_17_ITEM15_P703_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
797468_17_ITEM15_P704_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
797468_17_ITEM15_P705_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_17_ITEM15_P706_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
797468_17_ITEM15_P707_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
797468_17_ITEM15_P708_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
797468_17_ITEM15_P708_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
797468_17_ITEM15_P709_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
797468_17_ITEM15_P709_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
797468_17_ITEM15_P710_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_17_ITEM15_P711_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
797468_17_ITEM15_P712_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
797468_17_ITEM15_P713_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
797468_17_ITEM15_P714_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
797468_17_ITEM15_P715_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
797468_17_ITEM15_P716_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
797468_17_ITEM15_P717_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
797468_17_ITEM15_P718_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
797468_17_ITEM15_P719_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
797468_17_ITEM15_P720_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
797468_17_ITEM15_P721_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_17_ITEM15_P722_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
797468_17_ITEM15_P723_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
797468_17_ITEM15_P724_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(2)] , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If the prices of oil, natural gas, or NGLs continue to be volatile, reverse their recent increases or decline, Occidental's operations, financial condition, cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Changes in weather patterns and climate.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The impacts of the members of OPEC and other non-OPEC member-producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Generally, Occidental's practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the future.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Occidental bears the risks of equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance, title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, Occidental faces risks of:
797468_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Occidental's costs or reduce demand for Occidental's products.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling, construction, environmental and other permits and authorizations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Occidental s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as declines in crude oil, NGL, and gas prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Occidental s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, and assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates, and the variance may be material.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with SEC regulations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect Occidental s operations or results.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, natural gas and other products that Occidental s businesses produce.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas and other products produced by Occidental s businesses.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Consequently, government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental s business, financial condition and results of operations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against Occidental, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	It is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required, the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered, and Occidental s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company s oil, natural gas and other products.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, crude oil releases, including maritime releases and releases into navigable waters, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Cyber-attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Occidental relies on digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing and pipeline operations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	data and systems, release confidential information, corrupt data and disrupt critical systems and operations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Even though Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber-attack that it believes are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Further, Occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	While Occidental has experienced cyber-attacks in the past, Occidental has not suffered any material losses.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	However, if in the future Occidental's cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient, the potential consequences to Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	As cyber-attacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication, Occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance Occidental's cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security vulnerabilities.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect Occidental's business.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Unless Occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities, acquires properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology, government regulations and permits, and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) may differ from Occidental's estimates.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Tax Reform was enacted in December 2017 and made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and mandating a deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Occidental recorded the effects of the changes in the tax law for which the accounting was complete.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In accordance with the guidance from the SEC, Occidental recorded a provisional estimate for the federal and state tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and the resulting impact to the net federal deferred tax liability.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	With regards to the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) provisions of the new tax law, Occidental has recorded no tax liability based on preliminary estimates.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Occidental will adjust provisional amounts as updated information is evaluated.
797468_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing Occidental and other risks, including risks deemed immaterial, may have material adverse effects.
797468_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent a notice to an OPC subsidiary that it is seeking civil penalties related to a crude oil pipeline incident in Scurry County, Texas.
797468_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The subsidiary is contesting the $122,400 in penalties being sought.
797468_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	A section of this report and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_18_ITEM4_P0_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The current term of office of each executive officer of Occidental will expire at the May 4, 2018 , meeting of the Board of Directors or when a successor is selected.
797468_18_ITEM4_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the executive officers of Occidental:
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 24,500 stockholders of record at January 31, 2018 , and by approximately 700,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts.
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	Dividends declared on the common stock were $0.76 for the first and second quarter of 2017 and $0.77 for the third and fourth quarter ($3.06 for the year).
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S4	On February 8, 2018 , a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 16, 2018 , to stockholders of record on March 9, 2018 .
797468_18_ITEM5_P0_S5	The current annual dividend rate of $3.08 per share has increased by over 500 percent since 2002.
797468_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
797468_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS All of Occidental's stock-based compensation plans for its employees and non-employee directors have been approved by the stockholders.
797468_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	The aggregate number of shares of Occidental common stock authorized for issuance under such plans is approximately 35 million, of which approximately 6.1 million had been reserved for issuance through December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) Includes shares reserved to be issued pursuant to restricted stock units, stock options (Options), and performance-based awards.
797468_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	Shares for performance-based awards are included assuming maximum payout, but may be paid out at lesser amounts, or not at all, according to achievement of performance goals.
797468_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	(2) Price applies only to the Options included in column (a).
797468_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	Exercise price is not applicable to the other awards included in column (a).
797468_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	(3) A plan provision requires each share covered by an award (other than stock appreciation rights (SARs) and Options) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than the amount shown depending on the type of award granted.
797468_18_ITEM5_P4_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the amount shown may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash.
797468_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES Occidental s share repurchase activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 , were as follows:
797468_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	(a) Represents purchases from the trustee of Occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
797468_18_ITEM5_P6_S1	(b) Represents the total number of shares remaining at year end under Occidental's share repurchase program of 185 million shares.
797468_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	The program was initially announced in 2005.
797468_18_ITEM5_P7_S1	The program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.
797468_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index (S P 500), which Occidental is included in, and with that of Occidental s peer group over the five-year period ended on December 31, 2017 .
797468_18_ITEM5_P8_S1	The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the beginning of the five-year period shown in the graph below in: (i) Occidental common stock, (ii) the stock of the companies in the S P 500, and (iii) each of the peer group companies' common stock weighted by their relative market values within the peer group, and that all dividends were reinvested.
797468_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	Occidental's peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Total S.A. and Occidental.

797468_18_ITEM5_P11_S0	________________________________________________ (1) The cumulative total return of the peer group companies' common stock includes the cumulative total return of Occidental's common stock.
797468_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	Note : The statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
797468_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014.
797468_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	A section of this report and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions and dispositions, discontinued operations and other items affecting comparability.
797468_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end total shares of common stock outstanding, net of shares held as treasury stock, by the year-end closing stock price.
797468_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment operates a crude oil export terminal, as well as invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Occidental's oil and gas assets are located in some of the world s highest-margin basins and are characterized by an advantaged mix of short- and long-cycle, high-return development opportunities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	In the United States, Occidental continues to hold a leading position in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Other core operations are in the Middle East (Oman, Qatar and UAE) and Latin America (Colombia).
797468_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing business provides access to domestic and international markets through pipeline infrastructure and Occidental's Ingleside Crude Terminal with an emphasis on operational excellence.
797468_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	OxyChem is a world-class chemical business that generates high financial returns.
797468_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	STRATEGY General Occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through continual enhancements to its asset quality, organizational capability and innovative technical applications that provide competitive advantages.
797468_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The attributes of Occidental's strategy include its mix of short- and long-cycle investment opportunities, low base production declines, strong financial position and focus on generating shareholder returns through its value-based development approach.
797468_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:
797468_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Maintenance of a strong balance sheet to secure business and enhance shareholder value.
797468_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Occidental conducts its operations with a focus on its social responsibility commitments and initiatives, including health and safety, and environmental stewardship.
797468_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
797468_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and Occidental s strategy is to position the business to thrive in an up- or down-cycle commodity price environment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Recent strategic initiatives have resulted in Occidental exiting its non-core areas, including South Texas in 2017, and strengthening its position in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage and an advantaged asset portfolio.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	In 2017, Occidental continued to build upon its business, including a growing dividend and production growth at low oil prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	During the year, Occidental's board of directors and management implemented a short-term strategic plan that is intended to maintain production and sustain the dividend at a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $40 per barrel.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	At $50 WTI, Occidental s plan anticipates that the business will generate additional capital to cover production growth of 5 to 8 percent, and fulfill Occidental's dividend growth goal.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	This plan has continued into 2018 and, longer term, Occidental will continue to build upon this low-cost, high-margin value proposition through development and operation of its focused and advantaged assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	The following describes the application of Occidental s overall strategy for each of its operating segments:
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Oil and Gas Occidental s oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in health, safety and the environment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	In each core operating area, Occidental's operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, environmental and safety leadership, and commercial and governmental collaboration.
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs, and provide low-cost growth opportunities with advanced technology.
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result of Occidental's strategic positioning, Occidental's assets provide current production and a future portfolio of projects that are flexible, have short-cycle investment paybacks, deliver a low base decline and provide decades of diverse and unique opportunities to support energy demand across many future scenarios.
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Together with Occidental's technical capabilities, the oil and gas segment is able to achieve low development and operating costs to obtain full-cycle value while promoting innovative ideas that differentiate Occidental's approach and provide future opportunities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy primarily by:
797468_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Focusing many of Occidental's subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with focus on returns and maintain discipline and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental's existing positions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	In 2017, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $3.0 billion, and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the Permian Basin and the Middle East.
797468_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	This activity reflects Occidental's strategy to focus on achieving returns well above the cost of capital even in a low price environment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Management believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the Permian Basin and Colombia and focused international projects in the Middle East.
797468_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Chemical The primary objective of OxyChem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns.
797468_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to external customers.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Capital is employed to sustain production capacity in a safe and environmentally sound manner, as well as to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S5	In the first quarter of 2017, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., began commercial operations on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S6	The joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that U.S. shale gas development has presented to U.S. chemical producers by providing low-cost ethane as a raw material.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S7	The joint venture will provide OxyChem with an ongoing source of ethylene, significantly reducing OxyChem's reliance on third-party ethylene suppliers.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S8	In 2017, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $308 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P17_S9	An additional $39 million was contributed to the Mexichem joint venture.

797468_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Key Performance Indicators Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return.
797468_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
797468_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Specific measures such as per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding-and-development costs and reserves replacement percentages.
797468_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s financial performance.
797468_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2017 and 2016 :
797468_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2017 and 2016 :
797468_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Average WTI and Brent oil price indexes increased 18 percent and 22 percent, from $43.32 and $45.04 in 2016 to $50.95 and $54.82 in 2017 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Average worldwide realized oil prices rose $10.20, or 26 percent, in 2017 compared to 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	WTI and Brent oil price indexes increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 , closing at $60.42 per barrel and $66.87 per barrel, respectively, well above 2017 average prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The average realized domestic natural gas price in 2017 increased 22 percent from 2016 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	Average NYMEX natural gas prices increased 28 percent, from $2.42 in 2016 to $3.09 in 2017 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
797468_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operations 2017 Developments In the third quarter of 2017, Occidental closed on two divestitures of non-core acreage in the Permian Basin for proceeds of approximately $0.6 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $81 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Concurrently, Occidental purchased additional ownership interests and assumed operatorship in CO 2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) properties located in the Seminole-San Andres Unit for approximately $0.6 billion, which was primarily allocated to proved property.
797468_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2017, Occidental sold other non-core proved and unproved acreage in the Permian Basin for approximately $90 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $55 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Occidental also classified approximately $0.5 billion in non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage to assets held for sale at December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	In April 2017, Occidental completed the sale of its South Texas operations for net proceeds of $0.5 billion resulting in pre-tax gain of $0.5 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Business Review Domestic Interests Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns.
797468_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences.
797468_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Of the total 3.4 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 83 percent is leased, 16 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
797468_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following charts show Occidental s domestic total production volumes for the last five years:
797468_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Excludes volumes from California Resources, which was separated on November 30, 2014, and included as discontinued operations for all applicable periods.
797468_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Permian Basin extends throughout West Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for more than 20% of the total United States oil production.
797468_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities, and Permian EOR, which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as CO 2 floods and waterfloods.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	approximately 9 percent of the total oil in the basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	By exploiting the natural synergies between Permian Resources and Permian EOR, Occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Occidental can decrease its Permian Basin full-cycle breakeven costs, while continuing to add high-quality, low-cost breakeven inventory of future drilling locations faster than it is developed.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	The combined technical advancements, infrastructure utilization opportunities and operations across over 2.5 million net acres will provide sustainability of Occidental's low cost position in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	In the next few years, growth within Occidental s Permian Basin portfolio will be focused in the Permian Resources unconventional assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	In 2017, Occidental spent approximately $2.1 billion of capital in the Permian Basin, of which over 75 percent was spent on Permian Resources assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P34_S6	In 2018, Occidental expects to allocate approximately half of its worldwide 2018 capital budget to Permian Resources for development and approximately 15 percent to Permian EOR for the expansion of existing facilities to increase CO 2 production and injection capacity.
797468_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Permian Resources Permian Resources' unconventional oil development projects provide very short-cycle investment payback, averaging less than two years, that replaces the lower return production from assets divested during the 2013-2017 portfolio optimization, while also providing some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world.
797468_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	These investments provide better cash-flow and production growth, while increasing long-term value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed.
797468_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Occidental's Permian Resources inventory includes over 11,200 horizontal drilling locations in the Midland and Delaware sub-basins.
797468_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 750 of these drilling locations represented proved undeveloped reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	In 2017, Permian Resources produced approximately 141,000 net BOE per day from approximately 5,050 net wells, of which 18 percent are operated by other companies.
797468_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	In 2017, Permian Resources drilled 138 horizontal wells and added 127 million BOE from improved recovery to Occidental's proved reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Permian EOR The Permian Basin s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO 2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO 2 supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production.
797468_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	With 34 active floods and over 40 years of experience, Occidental is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO 2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent.
797468_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the CO 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects.
797468_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	Occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill extra depth into additional CO 2 floodable sections of the reservoir, and completed 91 well workovers in 2017 and has plans to complete 100 well workovers in 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	BOE to Occidental s proved reserves for improved recovery additions, primarily as a result of executing CO 2 flood development projects and expansions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Occidental's share of production from Permian EOR was approximately 150,000 BOE per day in 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding Occidental's existing CO 2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been water-flooded.
797468_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Other Domestic Occidental holds approximately 908,000 net acres in other domestic locations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Occidental's share of production in other domestic locations was approximately 5,000 BOE per day.
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	International Interests Production-Sharing Contracts Occidental's interests in Oman and Qatar are subject to production sharing contracts (PSC).
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit.
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC.
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_18_ITEM7_P40_S5	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.
797468_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following charts show Occidental s international production volumes for the last five years:
797468_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Operations sold or exited include Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

797468_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	In 2017, the average gross daily production was 22,000 BOE per day.
797468_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Occidental's Oman operations reached a significant milestone in November 2017 with the production of its one billionth gross barrel of oil, including condensate, from all its blocks.
797468_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Over two-thirds of this production has come in the last ten years, illustrating the tremendous growth achieved over that period.
797468_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	In 2017, Occidental's share of production in Oman averaged 95,000 BOE per day.
797468_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Qatar In Qatar, Occidental is the operator of the offshore fields Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each.
797468_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The terms for ISND and ISSD expire in October 2019 and December 2022, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Occidental's net share of production from ISND and ISSD was 53,000 BOE and 4,000 BOE per day respectively, in 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Occidental operated Al-Rayyan (Block 12) until the term expired on May 31, 2017, when Block 12 was successfully transitioned back to the Government of Qatar.
797468_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	Production from Block 12 in 2017 was not significant.
797468_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Occidental has continued to successfully implement large scale water flooding projects combined with state-of-the-art horizontal drilling, advanced completion techniques as well as utilizing extensive automated artificial lift systems that are significantly extending the life of the fields.
797468_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Since the commencement of its operations in 1994, Occidental has boosted the production from the Idd El Shargi fields by over 400 percent with current gross oil rates of around 91,000 BOE per day.
797468_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Utilizing Occidental s expertise in artificial lift, together with other game-changing technologies and innovations, the ISSD field continues to outperform expectations and exited 2017 with record gross production rates of over 9,000 BOE per day.
797468_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Despite complex marine operations, Occidental is recognized as a regional leader in its safety performance as well as being the lowest-cost offshore oil operator in the State of Qatar.
797468_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Occidental also partners in the Dolphin Energy project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests.
797468_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Occidental has a 24.5-percent interest in the upstream operations to develop and produce natural gas, NGLs and condensate from Qatar s North Field through mid-2032.
797468_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	Occidental also has a 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy Limited which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in "Midstream and Marketing Segment Pipeline Transportation.

797468_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Northern Llanos Basin Colombia Occidental has working interests in the La Cira-Infantas and Teca areas and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	In 2017, Occidental continued a thermal recovery pilot at the Teca heavy oil field and the initial results are better than anticipated.
797468_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	Production began from these pilots in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	Occidental's share of production from Colombia was approximately 31,000 BOE per day in 2017 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Proved Reserves Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	For the 2017 , 2016 and 2015 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $51.34, $42.75 and $50.28 per barrel, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	The calculated average Brent oil prices for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 disclosures were $54.93, $44.49 and $55.57, per barrel, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $3.08, $2.55 and $2.66 per MMBtu, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	Occidental had proved reserves at year-end 2017 of 2,598 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2016 amount of 2,406 million BOE.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S6	Proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 consisted of, respectively, 58 percent and 56 percent oil, 17 percent and 17 percent NGLs and 25 percent and 27 percent natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P54_S7	Proved developed reserves represented approximately 74 percent and 77 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources.
797468_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Changes in Proved Reserves Occidental's total proved reserves increased 192 million BOE in 2017 , which included additions of 206 million BOE from Occidental's development program.
797468_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Changes in reserves were as follows:
797468_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Many of these factors are outside management s control, and may negatively or positively affect Occidental's reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Revisions of Previous Estimates Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data.
797468_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental.
797468_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental's share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	In 2017, Occidental had positive revisions of 151 million BOE, mainly in the Permian Basin and Oman.
797468_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
797468_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	In 2017 , Occidental added proved reserves of 201 million BOE mainly associated with the Permian Basin and UAE.
797468_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO 2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects.
797468_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration.
797468_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells.
797468_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	either CO 2 or steam and other economic factors.
797468_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells.
797468_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells.
797468_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
797468_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Extensions and Discoveries Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	In 2017 , extensions and discoveries added 5 million BOE related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in Oman.
797468_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Purchases of Proved Reserves Occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.
797468_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	In 2017, Occidental purchased 99 million BOE of proved reserves in the Permian Basin, which mainly came from acquisitions made in the third quarter of 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Sales of Proved Reserves In 2017, Occidental sold 44 million BOE in proved reserves mainly related to the sales of South Texas and non-core Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Proved Undeveloped Reserves Occidental had proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2017 of 670 million BOE, compared to the year-end 2016 amount of 550 million BOE.
797468_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:
797468_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The increase in proved undeveloped reserves from the Permian Basin added approximately 168 million BOE through improved recovery, positive revisions and purchases.
797468_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The remaining additions mainly came from Oman and UAE.
797468_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	The 2017 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were partially offset by 89 million BOE of transfers to proved developed reserves, mainly from the Permian Basin, and sales of proved undeveloped reserves related to the sales of South Texas and non-core Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	represented 73 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The majority of Occidental s 2018 capital program of $3.9 billion is allocated to the development program in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Overall, Occidental plans to spend approximately $8 billion, or over 76 percent of total estimated future development costs, over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	Occidental s proved undeveloped reserves in international locations are associated with approved long-term international development projects.
797468_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Reserves Evaluation and Review Process Occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2017 , were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management.
797468_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts.
797468_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures.
797468_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced, and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance.
797468_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
797468_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.
797468_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled.
797468_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	The development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel.
797468_18_ITEM7_P77_S4	Annually a detailed review is performed by Occidental s Worldwide Reserves Group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date.
797468_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and has sufficient capital committed in the development plan.
797468_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan.
797468_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	A portion of the proved developed reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans.
797468_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data.

797468_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.
797468_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year.
797468_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	In 2017 , Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2017 , in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards.
797468_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s 2017 year-end total proved reserves portfolio.
797468_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	In 2017 , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process.
797468_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	WTI and Brent oil price indexes for 2017 were above the 2016 index prices closing at $60.42 per barrel and $66.87 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	Commodity prices remained relatively constant in 2017 and started to increase in the latter part of the fourth quarter.
797468_18_ITEM7_P85_S3	Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and costs in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids.
797468_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock.
797468_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
797468_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	These and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably.
797468_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental anticipates 2018 oil prices to be higher than average 2017 oil prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts.
797468_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
797468_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	In 2017, U.S. economic growth surpassed that of 2016 and was supported by growing demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks, even though natural gas and ethylene pricing was higher on average than in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Hurricane Harvey impacted the ethylene market in the second half of 2017 and ethylene pricing on average ended the year slightly higher than 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	resulted in higher margins, while PVC margins slightly improved as prices kept up with raw material costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Business Review Basic Chemicals In 2017, the U.S. economic growth rate was expected to exceed the 1.5 percent experienced in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The higher U.S. growth rate bolstered domestic demand as the 2017 industry chlorine operating rate increased by 4 percent, to 88 percent, resulting in an improvement in chlorine pricing in the second half of 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were stable in 2017 as U.S. ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing.
797468_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	Liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in 2017, as increased demand and tighter supply supported the higher pricing.
797468_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Vinyls Demand for PVC improved year-over-year with domestic demand improving 5 percent and export demand being on par with 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their year-over-year increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling.
797468_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Export volume remains a significant portion of PVC sales, representing over 30 percent of total North American producer s production.
797468_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	PVC industry operating rates decreased less than one percent compared to 2016, despite impact from Hurricane Harvey.
797468_18_ITEM7_P93_S4	Industry PVC margins slightly improved in 2017, as PVC pricing kept pace with higher ethylene cost.
797468_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Industry Outlook I ndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	Margins also depend on market supply-and-demand balances and feedstock and energy prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Strengthening in the petroleum industry may positively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental s products that are consumed by industry participants.
797468_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, which is anticipated to be relatively neutral in 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Basic Chemicals Continued improvement in the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	Export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	Chlor-alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to improve as oil and gas drilling activity increases in the U.S., which is expected to continue in 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Vinyls North American demand should continue to show improvement in 2018 over 2017 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects.
797468_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	American operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2017 but margins should improve as demand in the United States strengthens.
797468_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT Business Environment Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses including its gas processing, transportation, power-generation assets, and storage facilities and terminal business.
797468_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	The marketing business aggregates markets, and stores Occidental's and third-party volumes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Gas processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
797468_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2017 were significantly higher than those in 2016 primarily due to improved Permian to Gulf Coast price differentials, higher plant income due to higher NGL prices and higher income from a full year of operating the Ingleside Crude Terminal.
797468_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Business Review Pipeline and Gathering Systems and Transportation Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped.
797468_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.
797468_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy.
797468_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, and up to 2.5 Bcf per day in the summer.
797468_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,950 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin in West Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.
797468_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	The system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 7.1 million barrels of active storage capability and 128 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
797468_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	In 2017, Occidental expanded its oil pipeline system in New Mexico by an additional 50 miles.
797468_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	Occidental's 2017 pipeline transportation earnings increased from 2016 due to higher throughput volumes and improved margins.
797468_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Gas Processing Plants and CO 2 Fields and Facilities Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO 2 , and delivers dry gas to pipelines.
797468_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	Occidental s 2017 earnings from these operations increased compared to 2016 due to higher throughput volumes and higher realized NGL pricing.
797468_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, NGLs and sulfur.
797468_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	The facilities produce approximately 10,500 tons per day of sulfur, of which approximately 4,200 tons is Occidental's share.
797468_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	Al Hosn Gas facilities generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur.
797468_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	The increase in 2017 earnings compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher throughput volumes and higher sulfur pricing.
797468_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Power Generation Facilities Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	The decrease in earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 was a result of lower production due to longer outages and lower ancillary sales.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Storage Facilities and Terminal Assets Occidental owns the Oxy Ingleside Energy Center, which includes the Ingleside Crude Terminal, a crude oil storage and export terminal located in the Port of Corpus Christi in Ingleside, Texas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	The facility has a competitive advantage over other similarly situated export terminals, with a location near port entry, access to deep water, industry-leading loading rates and reduced lay times while berthed.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	The facility has over 300,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity, along with 2.1 million barrels of storage and three loading berths with 80,000 barrels per hour loading capability.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S3	The terminal is currently capable of loading articulated tug barges (ATB), medium range (MR), Aframax and Suezmax size vessels.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S4	In 2017, Occidental became the largest exporter of Permian light sweet crude from the United States (U.S.) Gulf Coast.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S5	The export market for crude has developed since the lifting of the export ban in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S6	While U.S. producers have increased production of light crude, U.S. refineries are constrained in their ability to process incremental volumes of light crude without significant incremental capital investment, necessitating exports to international markets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S7	In response to the increase in Permian production and the need to export these barrels, Occidental is expanding its terminal to approximately 750,000 barrels per day of capacity and 6.8 million barrels of storage which will be operational by the end of 2019.
797468_18_ITEM7_P109_S8	Occidental is also expanding the facility to be capable of loading VLCC size vessels by the fourth quarter of 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Marketing The marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including its own and third-party transportation and storage capacity.
797468_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Occidental s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	Marketing performance in 2017 improved compared to 2016 due to favorable Permian-to-Gulf Coast crude oil price differentials and higher marketing volumes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Industry Outlook The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	Marketing results can have significant volatile results depending on significant price swings, as well as Permian-to-Gulf Coast crude oil differentials.
797468_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending on NGLs prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P112_S3	Generally, higher NGLs prices result in higher profitability.
797468_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments.
797468_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
797468_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
797468_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	(a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	(a) Results include significant items listed below.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	(b) The 2017 gain on sale of assets included the sale of South Texas and non-core acreage in the Permian Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S2	The 2016 gain on sale of assets included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S3	(c) The 2017 amount included $397 million of impairment and related charges associated with non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S4	The 2015 amount included approximately $1.6 billion of impairment and related charges associated with non-core domestic oil and gas assets in the Williston Basin (sold in November 2015) and Piceance Basin (sold in March 2016).
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S5	The remaining 2015 charges were mainly associated with the decline in commodity prices and management changes to future development plans.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S6	(d) The 2016 amount included a net charge of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq.
797468_18_ITEM7_P116_S7	The 2015 amount included impairment and related charges of approximately $1.7 billion for operations where Occidental exited or reduced its involvement in and $3.4 billion related to the decline in commodity prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Domestic oil and gas results were losses of $0.6 billion, $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	Excluding significant items affecting results, domestic oil and gas results in 2017 increased from 2016, due to a 22 percent increase in realized oil prices, and lower DD A rates.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	Excluding significant items affecting results, domestic oil and gas results in 2016 were lower than 2015, due to a 13 percent decrease in realized oil prices, higher DD A rates, and lower oil volumes due to the sale of non-core domestic operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S2	International oil and gas earnings were $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively and a loss of $3.7 billion in 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S3	Excluding significant items affecting results, international oil and gas earnings in 2017, increased from 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S4	The improved 2017 earnings reflected a 32 and 20 percent increase in realized crude oil and NGL prices in the Middle East, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S5	Excluding significant items affecting results, the decrease in international oil and gas results in 2016, compared to 2015, reflected lower realized crude oil prices, which had decreased by 23 percent in the Middle East and 16 percent in Latin America.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S6	The decrease in prices was partially offset by lower DD A rates.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S7	Average production costs for 2017, excluding taxes other than on income, were $11.73 per BOE, compared to $10.76 per BOE for 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S8	The increase in average production costs per BOE reflected the sales of low margin non-core gas assets, including South Texas and Piceance Basin.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S9	Permian Resources production costs per BOE for 2017 decreased by 5 percent from the prior year due to continued improved operational efficiencies.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S10	Average production costs for 2016, excluding taxes other than on income, were $10.76 per BOE,compared to $11.57 per BOE for 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P118_S11	The decrease in average costs reflected lower maintenance, workover, and support costs as a result of improvements in operating efficiencies, especially in domestic operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	The following table sets forth the production volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 .

797468_18_ITEM7_P122_S5	The increase in production from on-going operations mainly reflected higher production from Al Hosn Gas as it was not fully operational in 2015 and higher production from Permian Resources, which increased its 2016 production by 13 percent compared to 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P122_S6	These increases were offset by lower production from South Texas and Other due to curtailed drilling.
797468_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	(a) Results include significant items listed below.
797468_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	(b) The 2016 amount included the $57 million gain on sale of the Occidental Tower in Dallas and a $31 million gain on the sale of a non-core specialty chemicals business.
797468_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	The 2015 amount included a $98 million gain on sale of an idled facility.
797468_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	Chemical segment earnings were $822 million, $571 million and $542 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	Excluding significant items affecting results, the year over year increase in 2017 earnings compared to 2016, was the result of higher realized pricing for caustic soda, improved vinyls margins, higher sales volumes across most product lines, and the addition of equity income from the joint venture ethylene cracker in Ingleside, Texas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	Excluding significant items affecting results, the decrease in 2016 earnings, compared to 2015, reflected lower PVC margins as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing, which was partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	(a) Results include significant items listed below.
797468_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	(b) The 2017 amount included a $94 million non-cash fair value gain on the Plains equity investment.

797468_18_ITEM7_P125_S4	The 2015 amount included an impairment charge of $814 million related to the Century gas processing plant as a result of our partner's inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	Midstream and marketing segment results were earnings of $0.1 billion and losses of $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	Excluding significant items affecting results, the increase in 2017 results compared to 2016, reflected higher marketing margins due to improved spreads, higher plant income due to higher NGL prices and higher income from a full year of operating the Ingleside Crude Terminal.
797468_18_ITEM7_P126_S2	Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in 2016 results compared to 2015 reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable contract pricing on long-term supply agreements as well as unfavorable Permian-to-Gulf Coast differentials, decreased throughput and lower realized NGLs pricing.
797468_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	Corporate The following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount.

797468_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	TAXES On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted which made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, repealing the corporate AMT and mandating a deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	Occidental recorded the effects of the changes in the tax law for which the accounting was complete.
797468_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	In accordance with the guidance from the SEC, Occidental recorded a provisional estimate for the federal and state tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and the resulting impact to the net federal deferred tax liability.
797468_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	Tax Reform resulted in a one-time non-cash gain of $583 million due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	Occidental recognized a noncurrent receivable of $221 million for its corporate AMT credit carryforwards.
797468_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	The tax impact of Occidental's deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings was fully offset by foreign tax credits.
797468_18_ITEM7_P130_S3	At December 31, 2017, Occidental reversed its indefinite re-investment assertion with regards to its investments in foreign subsidiaries and as a result, a deferred foreign tax liability of $99 million was recorded.
797468_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	The ultimate impact of Tax Reform may differ from Occidental s estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance.
797468_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	Occidental will adjust provisional amounts as updated information is evaluated.
797468_18_ITEM7_P131_S2	Refer to Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
797468_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.8 billion, were $581 million at December 31, 2017 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
797468_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:
797468_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	In 2017, Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate was 1 percent, which is lower than the 2016 rate mainly due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	items, Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate for 2017 would be 37 percent.
797468_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Changes in components of Occidental's results of continuing operations are discussed below:
797468_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	The increase in net sales in 2017 , compared to 2016 , was mainly due to the increase in average worldwide realized oil and NGLs prices, as well as higher realized prices for caustic soda in the Chemical business.
797468_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	Average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 26 percent from 2016 to 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P137_S2	The decrease in net sales in 2016 , compared to 2015 , was mainly due to the decline in average worldwide realized oil prices in 2016 and a decline in worldwide production as Occidental exited non-core areas.
797468_18_ITEM7_P137_S3	Average worldwide realized oil prices fell by approximately 18 percent from 2015 to 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment sales, which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.
797468_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	The 2017 gain on sale included the sale of South Texas and non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	The 2016 gain on sale included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties, the Occidental Tower building in Dallas, and a non-core specialty chemicals business.
797468_18_ITEM7_P139_S2	The 2015 gain on sale included $98 million for the sale of an idled chemical facility.
797468_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Cost of sales increased in 2017 from 2016 due primarily to increases in chemical feedstock and energy costs and higher oil and gas purchase injectants.
797468_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	Cost of sales decreased in 2016 from the prior year due primarily to lower oil and gas maintenance costs and lower chemical feedstock and energy costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to the change in timing of incentive compensation awards.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due to lower compensation accruals in 2015 related to Occidental's decision not to pay bonuses.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S1	DD A expense decreased in 2017, compared to 2016, due to lower volumes and lower DD A rates.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S2	DD A expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, due to lower volumes from the exited non-core oil and gas operations and lower DD A rates in the Middle East.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S3	In 2017, Occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of $545 million, of which $397 million related to proved and unproved non-core Permian acreage and $120 million for idled midstream assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S4	In 2016, Occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of $825 million, of which $541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and $160 million for the termination of crude oil supply contracts, $78 million related to the disposal of CRC stock and $61 million related to exits from Libya and Iraq.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S5	The allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2016 includes a reserve against the long-term receivable related to environmental sites indemnified by Maxus described in Note 8, Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S6	Occidental recorded a reserve against this receivable due to the uncertainty of collection as a result of the Maxus bankruptcy.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S7	Asset impairments and related items in 2015 of $10.2 billion included charges of $3.5 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to Occidental s exit from the Williston and Piceance basins, as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S8	International oil and gas charges of $5.0 billion were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S9	Midstream charges of $1.3 billion included the impairment of Occidental s Century gas processing plant as a result of our partner s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P141_S10	Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $227 million for its available for sale investment in California Resources.
797468_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	Taxes other than on income in 2017 increased from 2016 due primarily to higher oil, NGL and natural gas prices, which resulted in higher production taxes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	Taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to lower production taxes, which are directly tied to lower commodity prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	In 2017, Occidental recorded an income tax expense as opposed to an income tax benefit recorded in 2016, due to higher pre-tax operating income as a result of a recovery in commodity prices, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from Tax Reform.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	decreased in 2016 from the prior year as a result of a lower net loss in 2016, compared to 2015, which reflected significant impairments and related item charges.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	The increase in income from equity investments in 2017 from 2016 is the result of the OxyChem Ingleside facility beginning operations in the first quarter of 2017 and a non-cash fair value gain on the Plains equity investment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S2	The decline in income from equity investments in 2016 from 2015 is the result of lower Dolphin gas sales.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S3	There were no charges for discontinued operations in 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S4	Discontinued operations, net in 2016 and 2015 of $428 and $317 million, respectively, primarily include settlement payments by the Republic of Ecuador.
797468_18_ITEM7_P144_S5	See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
797468_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:
797468_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	Assets See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
797468_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	The increase in trade receivables, net, was the result of improved oil and gas prices at the end of 2017, compared to the end of 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	Average December WTI and Brent prices increased approximately 11 percent and 17 percent, per barrel, respectively from 2016 to 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	The increase in inventories in 2017 was the result of more exported domestic crude oil in transit in the midstream and marketing segment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P147_S3	Assets held for sale at the end of 2017 mainly reflected non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture, and the second quarter non-cash fair value gain related to Occidental's equity investment in Plains Pipeline.
797468_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	The decrease in property, plant and equipment, net (PP E), was due to depletion and sales of non-core assets, which was partially offset by capital additions and acquisitions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current maturities of long-term debt represent the $0.5 billion of 1.50-percent senior notes due 2018.
797468_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	The increase in accounts payable reflected higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of 2017, compared to the end of 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P149_S2	The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes was primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred taxes as a result of a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P149_S3	The decrease in long-term debt is the result of the reclassification of notes to current maturities of long-term debt.
797468_18_ITEM7_P149_S4	The decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends, partially offset by the 2017 net income.
797468_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2017 , Occidental had approximately $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
797468_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States.
797468_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P150_S3	Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance resulting from the spin-off of California Resources in the first quarter of 2016 to retire debt and pay dividends.
797468_18_ITEM7_P150_S4	In November 2016, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, comprised of $750 million of 3.0-percent senior notes due 2027 and $750 million of 4.1-percent senior notes due 2047.

797468_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August each year for each series of senior notes beginning August 15, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	Occidental used the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior note offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046.
797468_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	In February 2016, Occidental retired $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that had matured.
797468_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	In June 2015, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of debt that was comprised of $750 million of 3.50-percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750 million of 4.625-percent senior unsecured notes due 2045.
797468_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.48 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P155_S2	Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year for both series of notes, beginning on December 15, 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	As of December 31, 2017, Occidental had an undrawn $2.0 billion revolving credit facility (2014 Credit Facility).
797468_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility during 2017 or 2016, and no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	In January 2018, Occidental entered into a new five-year, $3.0 billion revolving credit facility (2018 Credit Facility), which replaced the 2014 Credit Facility, that was scheduled to expire in August 2019.
797468_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	The 2018 Credit Facility has similar terms to the 2014 Credit Facility and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow under the facility.
797468_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
797468_18_ITEM7_P157_S3	Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments and through future borrowings, and if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2017 increased $2.5 billion to $5.0 billion, from $2.5 billion in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S1	Operating cash flows were positively impacted by higher worldwide oil and NGLs prices and higher domestic volumes in the oil and gas business and improved margins in the midstream and marketing and chemicals businesses.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S2	Cash flows from continuing operations in 2017 also included $761 million of federal tax refunds.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S3	Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 decreased $0.7 billion to $2.5 billion, from $3.3 billion in 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S4	Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide average realized oil prices in the first half of 2016, which on a year-over-year basis declined 18 percent.
797468_18_ITEM7_P158_S5	The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs, especially in the oil and gas segment where year over year production costs decreased by 7 percent.
797468_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	continuing operations in 2016 also included collections of $325 million of federal and state tax refunds.
797468_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	Operating cash flows from discontinued operations reflected the collection of the Ecuador settlement.
797468_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.
797468_18_ITEM7_P159_S3	Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P159_S4	The chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	Occidental s capital expenditures increased by $0.9 billion in 2017 to $3.6 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	The increase was a result of additional capital spending primarily in the Permian Basin due to a recovery in the commodity price environment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	Occidental s net capital expenditures declined by $2.7 billion in 2016 to $2.9 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility; which is included in other investing activities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S3	The decline was a result of the oil and gas budget reduction due to lower commodity price environment and reductions in spending on long-term projects such as the OxyChem Ingleside facility, which came on line in early 2017.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S4	Occidental remains committed to allocating capital to its highest-return projects and its 2018 capital spending is expected to be $3.9 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S5	In 2017, cash flows provided by other investing activities of $0.4 billion includes proceeds of $1.4 billion, which were primarily related to the sale of non-core Permian acreage and Occidental's South Texas operations, partially offset by $1.1 billion of acquisition costs primarily related to Permian properties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S6	In 2016, cash flows used in other investing activities of $2.0 billion is comprised primarily of the acquisition of acreage in the Permian in October 2016.
797468_18_ITEM7_P160_S7	In 2015, cash flows used in other investing activities of $0.1 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	Cash used by financing activities in 2017 was $2.3 billion, as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2016 of $0.4 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	Financing activities in 2017 mainly consist of dividend payments of $2.3 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P161_S2	Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $0.4 billion, as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of $1.5 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P161_S3	Financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from long term debt of $4.2 billion and payments of long term debt of $2.7 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P161_S4	Occidental used restricted cash of $1.2 billion to pay dividends and retire debt.
797468_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of Occidental's off-balance-sheet arrangements.
797468_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Guarantees Occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees).
797468_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $272 million of Dolphin Energy's debt.

797468_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Delivery Commitments Occidental has commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	The domestic volumes contracted to be delivered, which are not presented in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements, are approximately 279 million barrels of oil through 2025, 2 Bcf of gas through 2019 and 25 million barrels of NGLs through 2019.
797468_18_ITEM7_P168_S2	The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.
797468_18_ITEM7_P168_S3	Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.
797468_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
797468_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM7_P171_S2	In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria.
797468_18_ITEM7_P171_S3	Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheet.
797468_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	In 2017, Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. filed a demand for arbitration, claiming it is entitled to a 40 percent share of the settlement payments made by the Republic of Ecuador to Occidental for the 2006 expropriation of Occidental s Participation Contract for Ecuador s Block 15.
797468_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	Occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration.
797468_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	The ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings on Occidental cannot be predicted.
797468_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	Management believes that the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Occidental's consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations or cash flows after consideration of recorded accruals.
797468_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Occidental s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters.
797468_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.
797468_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Tax Matters During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P175_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.
797468_18_ITEM7_P175_S2	Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P175_S3	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	Indemnities to Third Parties Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	As of December 31, 2017, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
797468_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P179_S2	OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P179_S3	Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems.
797468_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 148 sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	The following table presents Occidental s current and non-current environmental remediation reserves as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($137 million in 2017, $131 million in 2016, and $70 million in 2015) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities Environmental remediation reserves ($728 million in 2017, $739 million in 2016, and $316 million in 2015).
797468_18_ITEM7_P182_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL) sites and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	described above, and 89 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S1	As of December 31, 2017, three sites the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York - accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S2	The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites indemnified by Maxus.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S3	Five of the 70 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States, a sediment site in Louisiana and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities- accounted for 60 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S4	The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites indemnified by Maxus.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S5	Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and Texas accounted for 49 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P183_S6	Five other sites a landfill in Western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania- accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_18_ITEM7_P184_S2	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at all of its environmental sites could be up to $1.1 billion.
797468_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	Maxus Environmental Sites When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware.
797468_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.
797468_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.
797468_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.
797468_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	Occidental's accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S2	Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S3	Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S4	In June 2017, the court overseeing the Maxus bankruptcy approved a Plan of Liquidation (Plan) to liquidate Maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against YPF, Repsol and others to satisfy claims by Occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S5	In July 2017, the court-approved Plan became final and the trust became effective.
797468_18_ITEM7_P189_S6	Among other responsibilities, the trust will pursue claims against YPF, Repsol and others and distribute assets to Maxus' creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and Plan.
797468_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Environmental Costs Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:
797468_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.
797468_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental.
797468_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P192_S2	Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $137 million for 2018 .
797468_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America.
797468_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	aggregated approximately $9.8 billion, or 23 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date.
797468_18_ITEM7_P194_S1	Of such assets, approximately $8.2 billion are located in the Middle East and approximately $1.1 billion are located in Latin America.
797468_18_ITEM7_P194_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , net sales outside North America totaled $4.4 billion, or approximately 35 percent of total net sales.
797468_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions.
797468_18_ITEM7_P195_S1	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts.
797468_18_ITEM7_P195_S2	There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years.
797468_18_ITEM7_P195_S3	The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
797468_18_ITEM7_P195_S4	Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_18_ITEM7_P196_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_18_ITEM7_P197_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P198_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P198_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells, and development costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P198_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_18_ITEM7_P198_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_18_ITEM7_P198_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_18_ITEM7_P199_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_18_ITEM7_P199_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
797468_18_ITEM7_P199_S2	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production, and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_18_ITEM7_P200_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_18_ITEM7_P200_S1	It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P201_S0	data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_18_ITEM7_P202_S0	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S0	Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S1	For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S2	Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S3	Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S4	In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S5	For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S6	Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S7	These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S8	Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S9	Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S10	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P203_S11	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_18_ITEM7_P204_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
797468_18_ITEM7_P204_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_18_ITEM7_P205_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_18_ITEM7_P205_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P205_S2	It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments.
797468_18_ITEM7_P206_S0	For impairment testing, unless prices were contractually fixed, Occidental used observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows.
797468_18_ITEM7_P207_S0	Prices are held constant for periods beyond those covered by forward strip prices.
797468_18_ITEM7_P208_S0	Future operating and development costs were estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P208_S1	Market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.
797468_18_ITEM7_P208_S2	Current market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in 2018; however, changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, and applicable laws and regulations, and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts.
797468_18_ITEM7_P209_S0	Future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly.
797468_18_ITEM7_P209_S1	The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P209_S2	For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.55 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $120 million annually at current production rates.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_18_ITEM7_P210_S6	Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
797468_18_ITEM7_P211_S0	Chemical Assets Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_18_ITEM7_P211_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_18_ITEM7_P211_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_18_ITEM7_P211_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_18_ITEM7_P211_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S0	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S1	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S2	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S3	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S4	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_18_ITEM7_P212_S5	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_18_ITEM7_P213_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P213_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_18_ITEM7_P213_S2	Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.4 billion and its DD A expense for 2018 is expected to be approximately $350 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P213_S3	The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense.
797468_18_ITEM7_P213_S4	For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $44 million per year.
797468_18_ITEM7_P214_S0	Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_18_ITEM7_P215_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_18_ITEM7_P215_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_18_ITEM7_P216_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_18_ITEM7_P216_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P217_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_18_ITEM7_P218_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_18_ITEM7_P218_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
797468_18_ITEM7_P219_S0	throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_18_ITEM7_P220_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_18_ITEM7_P220_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P221_S0	Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_18_ITEM7_P222_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_18_ITEM7_P222_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_18_ITEM7_P223_S0	Fair Value Measurements Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P223_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
797468_18_ITEM7_P224_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P224_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_18_ITEM7_P224_S2	In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_18_ITEM7_P224_S3	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_18_ITEM7_P225_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_18_ITEM7_P225_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_18_ITEM7_P226_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_18_ITEM7_P227_S0	are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_18_ITEM7_P228_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_18_ITEM7_P228_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_18_ITEM7_P229_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_18_ITEM7_P229_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S0	Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_18_ITEM7_P230_S7	Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis.
797468_18_ITEM7_P231_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_18_ITEM7_P231_S1	Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S0	change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S1	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S2	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S3	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S4	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_18_ITEM7_P232_S5	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_18_ITEM7_P233_S0	If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings.
797468_18_ITEM7_P233_S1	For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $87 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P233_S2	If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $87 million.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S0	Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S1	Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S2	In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S3	Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S4	Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S5	Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors.
797468_18_ITEM7_P234_S6	See "Lawsuits, Claims and Contingencies" for additional information.
797468_18_ITEM7_P235_S0	See Note 3 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
797468_18_ITEM7_P236_S0	SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2, "Business and Properties," Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects.
797468_18_ITEM7_P237_S0	Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "might," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "aim," "goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements.
797468_18_ITEM7_P237_S1	You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
797468_18_ITEM7_P237_S2	Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
797468_18_ITEM7_P238_S0	Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodity Price Risk General Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $110 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGLs prices.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $20 million.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S6	These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S8	A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P0_S9	A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	According to IHS Chemical or Townsend, 2017 average contract prices were: chlorine-$324 per ton; caustic soda-$635 per ton; and PVC-$0.40 per lb.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management of various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Fair Value of Marketing Derivative Contracts Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:
797468_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	with a 95 percent level of confidence.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P9_S2	As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Interest Rate Risk General Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P11_S2	A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P11_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P14_S0	(a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts of $32 million and debt issuance cost of $47 million.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S2	Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S3	Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S4	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S6	As of December 31, 2017 , the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties.
797468_18_ITEM7A_P15_S7	Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2017 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	To The Stockholders and Board of Directors Occidental Petroleum Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ).
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S2	( PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S3	Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S9	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S10	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P0_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2002.
797468_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	To The Stockholders and Board of Directors Occidental Petroleum Corporation:
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	( PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ), and our report dated February 23, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S9	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
797468_18_ITEM8_P3_S10	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
797468_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
797468_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

797468_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	NATURE OF OPERATIONS In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).
797468_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.
797468_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments.
797468_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.
797468_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and power.
797468_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.
797468_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment operates a crude oil export terminal, as well as invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.
797468_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method.
797468_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
797468_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
797468_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped.
797468_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms.
797468_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue.
797468_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	Revenues from the production of oil and gas properties in which Occidental has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Occidental s net revenue interest.
797468_18_ITEM8_P17_S4	Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer.
797468_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.
797468_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Revenue from marketing activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer.
797468_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales.
797468_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue from all marketing activities is reported on a net basis.
797468_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.
797468_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances.
797468_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement.
797468_18_ITEM8_P21_S3	Management believes that these estimates and judgments provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods.
797468_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 , and net sales of approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America.
797468_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss, delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences.
797468_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.
797468_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.
797468_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash.
797468_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	Cash equivalents were approximately $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash was the result of the separation of California Resources in 2014.
797468_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , there was no restricted cash.
797468_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI).
797468_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.
797468_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	A decline in market value of any available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, Occidental considers all available information relevant to the investment, including past events and current conditions.
797468_18_ITEM8_P28_S4	Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.
797468_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	INVENTORIES Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence.
797468_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
797468_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue.
797468_18_ITEM8_P29_S4	For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable).
797468_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges.
797468_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found.
797468_18_ITEM8_P32_S3	If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
797468_18_ITEM8_P32_S4	Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense.
797468_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells.
797468_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12 -month period after drilling is complete.
797468_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31:
797468_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.
797468_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.
797468_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	It amortizes leasehold costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
797468_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
797468_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable.
797468_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment.
797468_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
797468_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants.
797468_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time.
797468_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	See Note 15 and below for further discussion of asset impairments.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S3	Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S4	If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed.
797468_18_ITEM8_P40_S5	The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Chemical Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to fifty years, are also used for impairment tests.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA).
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S4	Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S5	PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S6	Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S7	These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S8	The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S9	Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly.
797468_18_ITEM8_P41_S10	Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
797468_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Midstream and Marketing Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method.
797468_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	IMPAIRMENTS AND RELATED ITEMS In 2017, Occidental recorded net impairment and related charges of $397 million related to proved and unproved non-core Permian acreage and $120 million related to idled midstream and marketing facilities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	In 2016, Occidental recorded net impairment and related charges of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq and the termination of crude oil supply contracts at a cost of $160 million.
797468_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	The corporate amount included an allowance for doubtful accounts.
797468_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2016 includes a reserve against the long-term receivable related to environmental sites indemnified by Maxus described in Note 8.
797468_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	Occidental recorded a reserve against this receivable due to the uncertainty of collection as a result of the Maxus bankruptcy.
797468_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	In 2015, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges on oil and gas assets due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the decision to sell or exit non-core assets and changes in development plans for its non-producing assets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota and in December 2015, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado.
797468_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	In Iraq, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal and reassigned its interest in the Zubair Field in accordance with the contract terms.
797468_18_ITEM8_P46_S3	In Bahrain, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal, reassigning its interest, and completed the exit in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P46_S4	In Yemen, Occidental s non-operated interest in Block 10 East Shabwa Field expired in December 2015, and in February 2016, Occidental sold its interests in Block S-1, An Nagyah Field.
797468_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	In 2015, the midstream and marketing segment recorded an impairment charge for the Century gas processing plant as a result of our partner's inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO 2 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	(a) A portion of the 2015 charges are reported in the Midstream and Marketing segment.
797468_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments.
797468_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 using unobservable inputs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Fair Values - Recurring Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
797468_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
797468_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	These derivatives are classified as Level 1.
797468_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
797468_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves.
797468_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace, or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
797468_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.
797468_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $412 million and $341 million at December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S5	Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S6	The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established.
797468_18_ITEM8_P58_S7	Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis.
797468_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.
797468_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Many factors could affect Occidental's future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses.
797468_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
797468_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
797468_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
797468_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems.
797468_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
797468_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances.
797468_18_ITEM8_P61_S3	If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligations changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligations and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
797468_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning.
797468_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.
797468_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligations, of which $1.2 billion is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - asset retirement obligations, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at both December 31, 2017 , and 2016 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
797468_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment.
797468_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged.
797468_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item.
797468_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument.
797468_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.
797468_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed probable.
797468_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12.
797468_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSU) and capital employed incentive awards and return on assets (ROCEI/ROAI), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock and the estimated payout at the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	For total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from a Monte Carlo valuation model.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	Compensation expense for RSUs, ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	Compensation expense for the dividends accrued on unvested awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria, if applicable.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S4	All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense.
797468_18_ITEM8_P72_S5	The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	EARNINGS PER SHARE Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
797468_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units.
797468_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards.
797468_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, which are more fully described in Note 13, in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates.
797468_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns.
797468_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value.
797468_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available.
797468_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market.
797468_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer.
797468_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately $0.8 billion, $0.6 billion and $1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

797468_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the U.S. dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in U.S. dollars.
797468_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented.
797468_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.

797468_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	Under the new standard, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services.
797468_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	The new standard also requires more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
797468_18_ITEM8_P98_S3	Occidental will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2018.

797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Occidental stratified all revenue streams within each operating segment and compiled an inventory of all contracts from which a sample of customer contracts was reviewed to assess the required accounting under the new standard The review consisted of identifying whether such contracts are in scope of the new standard; whether there will be material changes in the timing or amount of revenue recognized from our historical accounting policies and practices; whether processes and controls are in place to evaluate new contracts for revenue recognition and to assemble any additional required disclosures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	Occidental has reviewed and considered interpretations and published guidelines from The Entities with Oil and Gas Producing Activities Revenue Recognition Task Force of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and certain public accounting firms, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	Occidental has completed its review of the sample contracts and does not expect any material change to the pattern or timing of revenue recognition and earnings as a result of adopting the new standard.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S3	Additionally, Occidental has assessed the disclosure requirements under the new standard and anticipates disclosing additional information, as necessary, to supplement the historical disaggregated revenue disclosures, including qualitative disclosures regarding the nature of its customer contracts and performance obligations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S4	Occidental is coordinating the data collection needs to meet those disclosure requirements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S5	Occidental continues to conduct training for accounting staff on the new standard.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S6	In February 2016, the FASB issued rules which require Occidental to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S7	The new rules require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S8	The lease liability represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S9	The corresponding right-of-use asset includes the discounted obligation in addition to any upfront payment or cost incurred during contract execution of the lease.
797468_18_ITEM8_P100_S10	The guidance retains the current accounting for lessors and does not make significant changes to the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows by a lessee.
797468_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease.
797468_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	Occidental is the lessee under various agreements for real estate, equipment, plants and facilities, aircraft, information technology hardware and vehicles that are currently accounted for as operating leases, refer to Note 6.

797468_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	Occidental will not be an early adopter of this standard.
797468_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	Occidental will apply the revised lease rules for its interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach, including several optional practical expedients related to leases commenced before the effective date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P101_S5	Occidental is currently evaluating the effect of these rules on its financial statements, training accounting staff and developing an internal interim software solution for the identification, documentation and tracking of leases in order to create an adoption plan based on Occidental's population of leases under the revised definition of leases.
797468_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	dependent on the leases in force at the time of adoption.
797468_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	As a result, the evaluation of the effect of the new standard will extend over future periods.

797468_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	Borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.
797468_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in 2017 on the total commitment amounts of the 2014 Credit Facility.

797468_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.
797468_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	At December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $272 million and $296 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt.
797468_18_ITEM8_P108_S3	The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
797468_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	At December 31, 2017 , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $9.9 billion, of which $0.5 billion is due in 2018, $0.1 billion is due in 2019, zero is due in 2020, $1.3 billion is due in 2021, $1.2 billion is due in 2022, and $6.8 billion is due in 2023 and thereafter.
797468_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $10.4 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $9.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material.

797468_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	Objective Strategy Occidental uses a variety of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts, including those designated as cash flow hedges, to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, transportation commitments and to fix margins on the future sale of stored volumes of oil and natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	Where Occidental buys product for its own consumption or sells its production to a defined customer, Occidental may elect normal purchases and normal sales exclusions.
797468_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	Occidental usually applies cash flow hedge accounting treatment to derivative financial instruments to lock in margins on the forecasted sales of its natural gas storage volumes, and at times for other strategies to lock in margins.
797468_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	Occidental also enters into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes; however, the results of any transactions are immaterial to the marketing portfolio.
797468_18_ITEM8_P116_S2	Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.
797468_18_ITEM8_P116_S3	The financial instruments, not designated as hedges, will impact Occidental's earnings through mark-to-market until the offsetting future physical commodity is delivered.
797468_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	Physical inventory is carried at lower of cost or market on the balance sheet.
797468_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	A substantial majority of Occidental's physical derivative contracts are index-based and carry no mark-to-market value in earnings.
797468_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Net gains and losses associated with derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in net sales.
797468_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	Net gains and losses attributable to derivatives instruments subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings.
797468_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Cash-Flow Hedges Occidental s marketing operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s leased storage facilities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes.
797468_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas.
797468_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The amount of cash-flow hedges, including the ineffective portion, was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts reported in net sales related to the outstanding commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2017, and 2016:
797468_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Fair Value of Derivatives Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - using unobservable inputs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	(a) Fair values are presented at gross amounts, including when the derivatives are subject to netting arrangements and presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.

797468_18_ITEM8_P127_S2	This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Credit Risk The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S3	Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S4	Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post.
797468_18_ITEM8_P128_S5	Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of December 31, 2017 , and 2016 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was immaterial for both December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

797468_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA NPL sites and three categories of non-NPL sites third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 16 of the 148 sites described above, and 89 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	As of December 31, 2017, three sites the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York - accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites indemnified by Maxus.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S3	Five of the 70 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States, a sediment site in Louisiana and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 60 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S4	The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites indemnified by Maxus.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S5	Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and Texas accounted for 49 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P134_S6	Five other sites a landfill in Western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.
797468_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
797468_18_ITEM8_P135_S2	Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at all of its environmental sites could be up to $1.1 billion.
797468_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Maxus Environmental Sites When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River.
797468_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware.
797468_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.
797468_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.
797468_18_ITEM8_P138_S1	The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.
797468_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million.
797468_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S1	Occidental's accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S2	Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S3	Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S4	In June 2017, the court overseeing the Maxus bankruptcy approved a Plan of Liquidation (Plan) to liquidate Maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against YPF, Repsol and others to satisfy claims by Occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs.
797468_18_ITEM8_P140_S5	In July 2017, the court-approved Plan became final and the trust became effective.

797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S1	Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S2	These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S3	Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S4	Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S5	In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S6	In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria.
797468_18_ITEM8_P145_S7	Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheet.
797468_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	In 2017, Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. filed a demand for arbitration, claiming it is entitled to a 40 percent share of the settlement payments made by the Republic of Ecuador to Occidental for the 2006 expropriation of Occidental s Participation Contract for Ecuador s Block 15.
797468_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	Occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration.
797468_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	The ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings on Occidental cannot be predicted.
797468_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	Management believes that the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Occidental's consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations or cash flows after consideration of recorded accruals.
797468_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	Occidental s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters.
797468_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.
797468_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
797468_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review.

797468_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes.
797468_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
797468_18_ITEM8_P151_S1	Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.
797468_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.
797468_18_ITEM8_P152_S2	As of December 31, 2017, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
797468_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials.
797468_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities.

797468_18_ITEM8_P153_S3	Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during 2018 and thereafter, which were approximately $0.7 billion.
797468_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows:
797468_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:
797468_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income:
797468_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted which made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and mandating a deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	In accordance with the guidance from the SEC, Occidental recorded a provisional estimate for the federal and state income tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and the resulting impact to the net federal deferred tax liability.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	Tax Reform introduced a new tax on certain foreign income which the statute refers to as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI).
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	GILTI is income of a U.S.-owned foreign corporation (net of allowed deductions) in excess of a 10 percent rate of return on the assets of the subsidiary.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S2	Tax Reform also introduced a base-erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) that aims to reduce the ability of multinational companies to use cross-border payments to shift income to affiliates in lower-taxed countries.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S3	Based on current analysis and interpretation of Tax Reform, Occidental does not anticipate a material GILTI or BEAT-related tax obligation and is recording no current or deferred tax impact with regards to GILTI or BEAT on a provisional basis.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S4	Further, pending definitive technical guidance from the states in which it is subject to income tax, Occidental has recorded a reasonable estimate of $10 million for the state tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation on a provisional basis.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S5	The ultimate impact of Tax Reform may differ from Occidental s estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance.
797468_18_ITEM8_P158_S6	Occidental will adjust provisional amounts as updated information is evaluated.
797468_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2017 , and 2016 were as follows:
797468_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, were $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P160_S1	Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.

797468_18_ITEM8_P161_S3	At December 31, 2017, Occidental reversed its indefinite re-investment assertion with regards to its investments in foreign subsidiaries and, as a result, a deferred foreign tax liability of $99 million was recorded.
797468_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and approximately $4 million of the state net operating loss carryforwards.
797468_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $249 million and $1 million in 2016, and 2015, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P162_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $22 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P162_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
797468_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount.
797468_18_ITEM8_P163_S1	Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.
797468_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	Occidental has recognized $76 million and $761 million in income tax receivables at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which were recorded in other current assets.

797468_18_ITEM8_P174_S2	The plan requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards.
797468_18_ITEM8_P174_S3	Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 27.7 million depending on the type of award granted.
797468_18_ITEM8_P174_S4	Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash, including awards that were issued under a previous plan that remain outstanding.
797468_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	During 2017 , non-employee directors were granted awards for 32,787 shares of common stock.
797468_18_ITEM8_P175_S1	Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the closing quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.

797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting.
797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S2	These awards vest from one to four years following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S3	For certain RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S4	For those awards that cliff vest between one to three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting or performance period, as appropriate, and are paid upon vesting or performance certification, as appropriate.
797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S5	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $66.62, $75.57, and $72.64 per share, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P177_S6	The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $67.21, $74.82, and $72.54, respectively.

797468_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
797468_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term).
797468_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (U.S. Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term.
797468_18_ITEM8_P181_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P181_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.
797468_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows:

797468_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs Certain employees have been granted Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) or Options that are settled in stock.
797468_18_ITEM8_P185_S1	Exercise prices of the Options were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P185_S2	No options were granted in 2017.
797468_18_ITEM8_P185_S3	The intrinsic value of options and stock-settled SARs exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016, and 2015 was zero, $1 million, and zero, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	The fair value of each Option or stock-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model.
797468_18_ITEM8_P186_S1	The expected life is estimated based on the vesting and expiration terms of the award.
797468_18_ITEM8_P186_S2	The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P187_S0	The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument.
797468_18_ITEM8_P187_S1	The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date.
797468_18_ITEM8_P187_S2	Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.

797468_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	ROCEI / ROAI Occidental grants share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period if performance targets based on return on assets of the applicable segment or return on capital employed are certified as being met.
797468_18_ITEM8_P189_S1	These awards are settled in stock upon certification of the performance target, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award.
797468_18_ITEM8_P189_S2	Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.

797468_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.
797468_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, level and employee contributions.
797468_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits.
797468_18_ITEM8_P192_S2	The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $175 million and $163 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and Occidental expensed $130 million in 2017 , $113 million in 2016 and $136 million in 2015 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
797468_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 500 domestic and 900 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
797468_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
797468_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
797468_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year.
797468_18_ITEM8_P195_S2	These benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $181 million in 2017 , $182 million in 2016 and $200 million in 2015 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans:
797468_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	The following tables show the funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans:
797468_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans:
797468_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2018 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs:
797468_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $5 million and zero, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P201_S1	The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $17 million and $1 million, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans:
797468_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2017 and 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
797468_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	In 2017, Occidental adopted the Society of Actuaries 2017 Mortality Improvement Scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined-benefit plans in the United States use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor s pension obligations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	The new mortality improvement scale reflects additional data that the Social Security Administration has released since the MP-2016 scale released in 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P205_S2	This additional data shows a lower degree of mortality improvement than previously reflected.
797468_18_ITEM8_P205_S3	The changes in the mortality improvement scale results in a decrease of $2 million and $9 million in the pension and postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary.
797468_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.0 percent to 10.8 percent at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P206_S2	The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.0 percent to 8.0 percent in 2017, depending on local economic conditions.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 1.97 percent as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S1	Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S2	For those union employees, Occidental projected that health care cost trend rates would decrease from 8.00 percent in 2017 until they reach 4.50 percent in 2025, and remain at 4.50 percent thereafter.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S3	A 1 percent increase or a 1 percent decrease in these assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of $42 million or a reduction of $34 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S4	The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes.
797468_18_ITEM8_P207_S5	The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	The investments are monitored by Occidental s Pension and Retirement Trust and Investment Committee (Investment Committee) in its role as fiduciary.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S2	The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S3	Equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S4	Other asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S5	The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P208_S6	Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
797468_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows:
797468_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	(a) This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries.
797468_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	(b) This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities.
797468_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	(c) This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries.
797468_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	Occidental expects to contribute $5 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during 2018 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:
797468_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENTS As of December 31, 2017 , and 2016 , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion of equity-method investments, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental s equity investments consisted mainly of an equity interest in Plains Pipeline, a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, a 50-percent interest in OxyChem Ingleside facility, and various other partnerships and joint ventures.
797468_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	Equity investments paid dividends of $297 million, $224 million, and $438 million to Occidental in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P212_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since they were acquired was immaterial.
797468_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $649 million, of which $464 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives.
797468_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments:
797468_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a 24.5 -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a 24.5 -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment.
797468_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time, Occidental purchases oil, NGLs, power, steam and chemicals from and sells oil, NGLs, natural gas, chemicals and power to certain of its equity investees and other related parties.
797468_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the following amounts due from or to its related parties:
797468_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , sales of Occidental-produced oil and NGLs to Plains Pipeline affiliates accounted for 86 percent, 89 percent and 87 percent of these totals, respectively.
797468_18_ITEM8_P216_S1	Sales to Plains Pipeline affiliates related to Occidental's oil and gas production are disclosed above.
797468_18_ITEM8_P216_S2	In addition to these sales, Occidental conducts marketing activities with Plains Pipeline affiliates for oil, NGLs and transportation.
797468_18_ITEM8_P216_S3	Net margins associated with these marketing activities are negligible.
797468_18_ITEM8_P216_S4	(b) In 2017 , purchases of ethylene from the Ingleside ethylene cracker accounted for 98 percent of related-party purchases.
797468_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	In January 2012, Occidental entered into a long-term contract to purchase CO 2 .
797468_18_ITEM8_P217_S1	This contract contains a price adjustment clause that is linked to changes in NYMEX crude oil prices.
797468_18_ITEM8_P217_S2	Occidental determined that the portion of this contract linked to NYMEX oil prices is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and Occidental therefore bifurcated this embedded pricing feature from its host contract and accounts for it at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
797468_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	The following tables provide fair value measurement information for assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis:
797468_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	FAIR VALUES NONRECURRING During 2017, Occidental recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $397 million primarily related to held for sale non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage.
797468_18_ITEM8_P219_S1	Assumptions for proved and unproved properties classified as held for sale include estimated third-party prices to be received based on recent transactions of similar acreage.
