884219_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Operating results for the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the operating results for the Marketing Events Group are adversely affected.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Similarly, many of the retail shopping mall and lifestyle center clients of the Marketing Events Group may reduce marketing expenditures when economic conditions deteriorate.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Revenues from the Travel Recreation Group businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Viad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Viad has not hedged its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period to period comparisons.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	During 2010, $165.0 million of revenue and $9.5 million of operating income was derived through Canadian and United Kingdom operations of Viad s Marketing Events International segment.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, $64.2 million of 2010 revenue and $15.8 million of 2010 operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For this segment, Canadian operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and therefore, revenue and operating income in the Travel Recreation Group segment.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Exhibition rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer).
884219_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than when they have historically been held.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins in a given period if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a consequence of these factors, the operating results for these businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees or others, to travel.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities could adversely impact revenues.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Although no single client accounts for more than five percent of the revenue of any of Viad s reporting segments, the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments have a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The loss of any of these large clients would adversely affect results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, revenues of the Marketing Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing and other services.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	When the Marketing Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the show organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform these electrical and plumbing services, subject in each case to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibitions space.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, some of these facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of these services.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing Events Group has these relationships seek to move these services in-house, Viad s revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenues) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take that customer to a competitor.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that could complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Any acquisition can involve a number of risks, including: the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. segment generally reports its highest revenues during the first quarter of each year, while the Marketing Events International segment generally reports its highest revenues during the second quarter of each year.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Travel Recreation Group businesses are also seasonal, experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters; these quarters accounted for 84 percent of the segment s 2010 revenues.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could reduce the operating results of Viad s businesses.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. and International segments rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities and customer facilities.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If they were unable to secure the services of these independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on these businesses and their results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on these businesses and operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Similarly, disruption of transportation services could adversely affect the ability of the Marketing Events Group to supply time-sensitive holiday-themed exhibits and experiences to retail shopping mall and lifestyle center customers and could cause the cancellation of the exhibits and experiences.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-fourth requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to the customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In either event, Viad s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Moreover, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective bargaining process, the union may strike or carry-out other types of work stoppages.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could adversely affect the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans to which Viad contributes may have an adverse impact on operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Viad s contributions to these multi-employer plans in 2010 and 2009 totaled $15.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to these plans.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have an adverse impact on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Competition in the exhibition and events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting operating results.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If Viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment, results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over seven decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food and fresh meats.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Some of these businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, the subject of litigation.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by these businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of those of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover these future liabilities, results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions, and reserves or insurance become inadequate.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad s business.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Such catastrophic events could impact our production facilities preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and also could cause a disruption in the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels and other public venues.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Such catastrophic events also could cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues.
884219_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, Viad could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition.
884219_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Viad s businesses operate service or production facilities and maintain sales and service offices in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United Arab Emirates.
884219_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The principal properties of Viad s businesses as of December 31, 2010, were:
884219_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Viad s headquarters are located at 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 800 in Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4545.
884219_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Excluding space which is subleased to third parties, Viad leases approximately 59,400 square feet.
884219_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. segment operates 20 offices and 28 multi-use facilities (manufacturing, sales and design, office and/or warehouse and truck marshaling yards).
884219_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 590,900 square feet.
884219_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Three of the multi-use facilities are owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	The Marketing Events International segment operates six offices and 20 multi-use facilities, with three offices and eight multi-use facilities in Canada, one office and eight multi-use facilities in the United Kingdom, one office and two multi-use facilities in Germany and one office and two multi-use facilities in the United Arab Emirates.
884219_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 134,000 square feet.
884219_11_ITEM2_P3_S2	One of the multi-use facilities is owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment operates two offices, nine retail stores, one bus terminal, three garages, an icefield tour facility, a gondola lift operation, a boat tour facility and nine hotels/lodges (with approximately 900 rooms and ancillary foodservice and recreational facilities).
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	All of the facilities are in the United States or Canada.
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S2	Four of the hotels/lodges are owned and the five other hotels/lodges are operated pursuant to concessionaire agreements.
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S3	One bus terminal, three garages and the boat tour facility are owned and one garage is leased.
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S4	The icefield tour facility and gondola lift operation are operated through lease agreements with Parks Canada and all other properties are leased.
884219_11_ITEM2_P4_S5	In January 2011, Viad acquired a 145-room hotel with ancillary foodservice facilities in Whitefish, Montana, which is operated by Glacier Park within Viad s Travel Recreation Group segment.
884219_11_ITEM2_P5_S0	Management believes that the Company s facilities in the aggregate are adequate and suitable for their purposes and that capacity is sufficient for current needs.
884219_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Viad and certain subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2010 with respect to certain of these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for, including insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial condition or results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure for actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for, including insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	The names, ages and positions of Viad s executive officers as of the filing of this Annual Report, are listed below:

884219_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
884219_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The principal market on which Viad s common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange.
884219_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The common stock is also admitted for trading on the American, Chicago, National, Pacific and NASDAQ OMX Exchanges.

884219_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Viad Corp s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
884219_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Viad Corp s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
884219_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Viad s reportable segments consist of Marketing Events U.S., Marketing Events International and Travel Recreation Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	In July 2009, Viad announced a strategic reorganization to align its brands and operations into two operating groups: the Marketing Events Group and the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The operating groups are supported by a Corporate Services Group that centralizes responsibility for various corporate functions.
884219_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	On the close of business on December 31, 2009, substantially all of the domestic operations of the Marketing Events Group were combined into one legal entity by transferring all of the assets and third party liabilities of Exhibitgroup/Giltspur, a division of Viad Corp, The Becker Group, Ltd. ( Becker Group ) and other related entities into GES Exposition Services, Inc.
884219_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Furthermore, on February 2, 2010, GES Exposition Services, Inc. changed its name to Global Experience Specialists, Inc. ( GES ).
884219_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	The services that were previously provided under the Company s brands of Exhibitgroup/Giltspur and Becker Group are now provided under the Global Experience Specialists brand.
884219_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Beginning in 2010, the Company changed its reportable segments as a result of the reorganization and consolidation of business units within the Marketing Events Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The reportable segments are based on geographical lines of responsibility and reflect the management structure and internal organization of the business.
884219_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Accordingly, the presentation of segment information for the Marketing Events Group is based on the redefined segments, and comparable information for earlier periods has been restated to reflect the revised segment structure.
884219_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Marketing Events Group specializes in all aspects of the design, planning and production of face-to-face events, immersive environments and brand-based experiences for clients, including show organizers, corporate brand marketers and retail shopping centers.
884219_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the Marketing Events Group provides a variety of immersive, entertaining attractions and brand-based experiences, sponsored events, mobile marketing and other branded entertainment and face-to-face marketing solutions for clients and venues, including shopping malls, movie studios, museums, leading consumer brands and casinos.
884219_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The composition of the Marketing Events Group s reportable segments reflects geographical lines of responsibility.
884219_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	segment includes all domestic GES and affiliated operations, including those services formerly provided under the Exhibitgroup/Giltspur and Becker Group brands.
884219_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The consolidation of the domestic Marketing Events Group operations is intended to provide a fully integrated service delivery network through a realigned sales organization, shared infrastructure and facilities, and a common operational platform.
884219_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	International segment includes all foreign operations of the Marketing Events Group and consists of two operating segments: Canada and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Asia).
884219_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	This reporting segment includes the operations of the following companies: GES Exposition Services (Canada) Limited, Melville Exhibition and Event Services Limited and affiliates (collectively Melville ), SDD Exhibitions Limited and GES GmbH Co. KG.
884219_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Travel and recreation services are provided by Brewster Inc. ( Brewster ) and Glacier Park, Inc. ( Glacier Park ).
884219_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Brewster provides tourism services in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and in other parts of Western Canada.
884219_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Brewster s operations include the Banff Gondola, Columbia Icefield Ice Explorer Tours, motorcoach services, charter and sightseeing services, tour boat operations, inbound package tour operations and hotel operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Glacier Park operates four historic lodges and three motor inns and provides food and beverage operations, retail operations and tour and transportation services in and around Glacier National Park in Montana and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada.
884219_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Glacier Park is an 80 percent owned subsidiary of Viad.
884219_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following 2010 financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ):
884219_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following discussion includes a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses, which are utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Income before impairment losses is defined by Viad as income from continuing operations before the after-tax effect of impairment losses related to goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Adjusted EBITDA is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation, debt service costs, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	Income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of non-cash impairment losses.
884219_11_ITEM7_P15_S5	These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are net income attributable to Viad and income from continuing operations attributable to Viad, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Although Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, the use of Adjusted EBITDA is limited because it does not consider material costs, expenses and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment losses or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Similarly, although Income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, its use is limited because it does not consider non-cash goodwill, other intangible asset and other long-lived asset impairment losses.
884219_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Because Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses do not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad and income from continuing operations attributable to Viad as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the Company s performance.
884219_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Viad is as follows:
884219_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million from 2009 to 2010 was primarily driven by higher segment operating results at all operating segments and lower restructuring charges.
884219_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $91.9 million from 2008 to 2009 was primarily driven by lower segment operating results at all operating segments, restructuring charges and lower interest income, partially offset by lower corporate activities expense.
884219_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	A reconciliation of income (loss) before impairment losses attributable to Viad to income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Viad is as follows:
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenues for 2010 increased 4.8 percent to $844.8 million compared to $805.8 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2.6 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $133.4 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Impairment losses for 2010 were $268,000 (after-tax), or $0.01 per diluted share.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	In 2009, the Company recorded impairment losses of $98.2 million (after-tax), or $4.92 per diluted share, primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the Marketing Events Group, as well as $2.9 million related to the write down of a non-strategic real estate asset held for sale as of December 31, 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	Income attributable to Viad before impairment losses for 2010 was $449,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to the 2009 loss attributable to Viad before impairment losses of $7.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	Net restructuring charges in 2010 were $4.2 million compared to $14.1 million in 2009, both primarily related to the Marketing Events Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	The improved results as compared to 2009 were also the result of higher revenues, overhead reductions and productivity improvements driven by the Company s Lean initiatives.
884219_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net income attributable to Viad for 2010 was $443,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $104.7 million, or $5.25 per diluted share, in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	These results include income from discontinued operations of $262,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2010 and $679,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2009 relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	During 2010, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in increases in revenues and segment operating income of $8.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, as compared to 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on full year revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations:
884219_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Accordingly, Viad s full year results were primarily impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Future decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $571.0 million for 2010, up 0.4 percent compared to $568.4 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase was primarily due to positive show rotation of $15 million in revenue, mostly offset by reductions in brand marketer spending and a base same-show revenue decline of one percent.
884219_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year.
884219_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Base same-shows represented 37.1 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2010.
884219_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The 2010 segment operating loss was $15.2 million, compared to a loss of $22.1 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	The improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues, overhead reductions of approximately $10 million versus 2009 and productivity improvements driven by the Company s Lean initiatives, partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentives (which were not significant in 2009) and pricing pressures.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $197.8 million for 2010, up 14.6 percent compared to $172.6 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Segment operating income was $10.1 million in 2010, compared to $9.2 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rates during 2010, resulting in increases of $4.3 million in revenue and $519,000 in segment operating income, as compared to 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2010 revenues increased by $20.8 million, or 12.1 percent, and operating income increased by $343,000, or 3.7 percent.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	The increase in revenue primarily resulted from market share gains, improving industry trends, a major project for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Canada and positive show rotation of $3 million.
884219_11_ITEM7_P29_S5	The improved operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues, partially offset by performance-based incentives and the reinstatement of full wages after a temporary reduction in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenues are affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement.
884219_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Following quarterly declines from the second quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010, Marketing Events U.S. base same-show revenues were essentially flat in the 2010 second quarter and increased by 8.6 percent and 16.6 percent in the 2010 third and fourth quarters, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Excluding the strong growth of a major auto show, the fourth quarter increase in U.S. base same-show revenues was 5.4 percent.
884219_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In 2011, management expects U.S. same-show revenues to increase at a mid-single-digit rate.
884219_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Additionally, management expects show rotation to positively impact full year revenues by approximately $10 million.
884219_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Foreign currency exchange rate variances are not expected to have a significant impact on full year 2011 results.
884219_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Management remains focused on improving the profitability of the U.S. segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs.
884219_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Management expects to record restructuring charges of approximately $500,000 in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of these efforts.
884219_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Additional charges may be incurred as additional cost structure improvements are made.
884219_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Marketing Events Group is subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs, about one-fourth of which expire each year.
884219_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Although labor relations between the Company and labor are currently stable, disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $88.3 million, up 17.2 percent compared to 2009 revenues of $75.3 million.
884219_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rate variances during 2010, resulting in increases of $4.4 million and $538,000 in revenues and segment operating income, respectively, as compared to 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2010 revenues increased by $8.6 million, or 11.4 percent, primarily due to initiatives to capture incremental spend per guest as well as stronger demand for the Company s tourism services that was partly related to the centennial anniversary of Glacier National Park and the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management expects 2011 results from the Travel Recreation Group segment to benefit from improved tourism demand versus 2010.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2010 will not have a significant impact on 2011 results.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	Additionally, management anticipates lower room revenues at Many Glacier Hotel, a property operated by Glacier Park, Inc., due to planned construction that will reduce the number of rooms available during 2011 as compared to 2010.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	However, management expects the acquisition of Grouse Mountain Lodge, which is located near Glacier National Park, to more than offset the revenue decline at Many Glacier Hotel.
884219_11_ITEM7_P37_S5	The Company acquired the 145-room Grouse Mountain Lodge on January 5, 2011 for $10.5 million in cash.
884219_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	During 2010, approximately 73 percent of revenue and 79 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income from the Travel Recreation Group segment.
884219_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Glacier Park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park.
884219_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Glacier Park s original 25-year concession contract with the Park Service that was to expire on December 31, 2005, has been extended for six one-year periods and now expires on December 31, 2011.
884219_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Park Service, in its sole discretion, may continue extending Glacier Park s concession contract in one-year increments.
884219_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	When this contract ultimately expires, Glacier Park will have the opportunity to bid on a new concession contract.
884219_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	If Glacier Park does secure a new contract, possible terms would be for 10, 15 or 20 years.
884219_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Glacier Park generated approximately 70 percent of its 2010 revenue through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	If a new concessionaire is selected by the Park Service, Glacier Park s remaining business would consist of its operations at Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada; East Glacier, Montana and Whitefish, Montana.
884219_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	In such a circumstance, Glacier Park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract.
884219_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Glacier Park owns its Glacier Park Lodge operations in East Glacier, Montana as well as the Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana (acquired January 5, 2011).
884219_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Glacier Park also owns the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, which is operated under a ground lease with the Canadian Government that was recently renewed for a 42-year term running through January 31, 2052.
884219_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Glacier Park generated approximately 25 percent of the Travel Recreation Group s full year 2010 segment operating income.
884219_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Corporate activities expense of $6.4 million in 2010 increased from $5.6 million in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher performance-based compensation expense in 2010 as compared to performance-based compensation expense reversals in 2009, partially offset by lower consulting fees in 2010.
884219_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	In 2010, Viad recorded impairment losses of $302,000 related to other intangible assets and certain property and equipment at the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	In 2009, Viad recorded impairment losses of $116.9 million, including $112.3 million related to the non-cash write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets at the Marketing Events Group, $1.7 million related to touring exhibit assets at the Marketing Events Group and $2.9 million related to the write-down of a non-strategic real estate asset held for sale at the Travel Recreation Group as of December 31, 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	In 2010, Viad recorded gross restructuring charges of $5.0 million compared to $15.4 million in 2009 primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of the elimination of certain positions as well as facility consolidations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	In 2010, Viad also reversed restructuring reserves of $814,000 versus $1.3 million in 2009 primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities.
884219_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The effective tax rate for 2010 was 68.1 percent compared to 21.5 percent for 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The relatively high rate for 2010 compared to the statutory rate was due to the write-off of deferred taxes of $1.3 million as a result of recent health care legislation, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $514,000.
884219_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Excluding the effects of these items, the 2010 effective rate was 38.2 percent.
884219_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The relatively low rate for 2009 compared to the statutory rate was due to the effect of certain nondeductible impairment losses of $26.8 million, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $3.5 million.

884219_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	These declines resulted primarily from a significant reduction in exhibition marketing spending, as well as show rotation that negatively impacted revenue by $87 million versus 2008.
884219_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Marketing Events U.S. base same-show revenues declined 22.5 percent in 2009.

884219_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	Additionally, the declines versus 2008 reflect lower sales of holiday-themed events and experiences and retail merchandising units as shopping center clients reduced spending in response to the recession.
884219_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $172.6 million for 2009, down 23.6 percent compared to $225.9 million in 2008.

884219_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2009 revenues decreased by $26.5 million, or 11.7 percent, primarily due to a significant reduction in exhibition marketing spending.
884219_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	During 2009, Viad revised downward its forecast for future revenues and earnings in the Marketing Events Group based on continued declines in exhibition marketing spending by its customers and a sharper than expected decline in retail holiday d cor demand.
884219_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result, the Company projected a more prolonged contraction in its trade show and retail marketing revenues than was previously anticipated.
884219_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Due to these facts and circumstances, Viad performed an impairment evaluation of goodwill, other intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	As a result of the evaluation, Viad recorded aggregate impairment losses of $114.0 million primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets.

884219_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	Primarily as a result of the strategic reorganization, Viad recorded restructuring charges of $14.6 million during 2009 related to the Marketing Events Group.
884219_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	In addition, Viad also reversed restructuring reserves of $1.3 million primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities.

884219_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	During 2009, approximately 72 percent of revenue and 80 percent of operating income generated by Viad s Travel Recreation Group segment was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	These operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and, therefore, revenue and operating income in the Travel Recreation Group segment.

884219_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	In 2009, Viad recorded impairment losses of $116.9 million, including $112.3 million primarily related to the non-cash write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets at the Marketing Events Group, $1.7 million related to touring exhibit assets at the Marketing Events Group and $2.9 million related to the write-down of a non-strategic real estate asset held for sale as of December 31, 2009 at the Travel Recreation Group.

884219_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The effective tax rate for 2009 was 21.5 percent compared to 32.2 percent for 2008.
884219_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The relatively low rates compared to the statutory rate were primarily due to certain nondeductible impairment losses recorded in 2009 and 2008 and also reflect aggregate favorable resolution of tax matters of $3.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Excluding the effects of these items, Viad s effective tax rates were 39.0 percent and 37.1 percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

884219_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The amended Credit Facility provides for a $75 million revolving line of credit, which was lowered from $150 million, and may be increased up to an additional $50 million under certain circumstances.
884219_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	The Credit Facility borrowings are to be used for general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions) and to support up to $25 million of letters of credit.

884219_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Aggregate liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of $1.1 million (including interest and penalties) are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are highly uncertain.
884219_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.

884219_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The SEC has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates:
884219_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

884219_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events U.S. segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level, which represents all domestic operations of GES.
884219_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	Furthermore, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events International segment is assigned to and tested at the component level within the segment s geographical operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting units in the United Kingdom (Melville) and Canada was $13.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P90_S5	Also, as of December 31, 2010, the Brewster operating segment (within the Travel Recreation Group) had goodwill of $42.3 million.
884219_11_ITEM7_P90_S6	Brewster is considered a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	Furthermore, the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Viad had aggregate goodwill of $127.4 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	Furthermore, as a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2010, the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test were 80 percent, 69 percent and 69 percent, respectively, for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom (Melville) and Canada.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	For the Brewster reporting unit, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 50 percent as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	Due to continued uncertainties in the current economic environment, reductions in the Company s expected future revenue, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment losses.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	Furthermore, management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the Company as ongoing declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment.
884219_11_ITEM7_P94_S5	See Results of Operations above and Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of goodwill impairment losses recorded during 2009 and 2008.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S5	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $67.1 million and $61.2 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P95_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	During 2010 and 2009, Viad recorded pre-tax losses from its operations in the United States.
884219_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The Company considered the negative evidence of these domestic pre-tax operating losses on the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Viad also considered positive evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets including the Company s historical and forecasted taxable income, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	Furthermore, Viad also considered the fact that goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible and thus did not contribute to tax losses in 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad had a valuation allowance of $411,000 and $162,000, respectively, related to certain state deferred tax assets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	In light of the Company s recent domestic operating losses, and the continued uncertainties in the current economic environment, it is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	If such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
884219_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad did not have any accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	However, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of $146,000 and $407,000, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of $514,000, $3.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	These tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In addition to the above, Viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $636,000 as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009.
884219_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $351,000 and $313,000, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	Future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations (net of federal tax effects, if applicable).
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Insurance liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability and property loss claims.
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to Viad s continuing operations was $22.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Of this total, $16.2 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $6.4 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	Viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling $7.5 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S4	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_11_ITEM7_P102_S5	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $200,000 to $500,000 on a per claim basis.
884219_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $6.8 million, $6.7 million and $8.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.6 million to its funded pension plans and $943,000 to its unfunded pension plans in 2011.
884219_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $500,000 to the plans in 2011.
884219_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine and one-half percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2009 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was ten percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by approximately $1.6 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $124,000.
884219_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 by approximately $1.4 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $104,000.
884219_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	See Note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan ).
884219_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	The 2007 Plan has a ten-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $3.5 million, $3.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	Furthermore, the total tax benefits related to such costs were $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $2.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2010, 2009 or 2008.
884219_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price until the time of settlement.
884219_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility; the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding; the expected dividend yield on Viad common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	Changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	See Note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	For a description of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Viad s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Among other things, natural disasters, gains and losses of customers, consumer demand patterns, labor relations, purchasing decisions related to customer demand for exhibition and event services, existing and new competition, industry alliances, consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which Viad competes, acquisitions, adverse developments in liabilities associated with discontinued operations, any deterioration in the economy and other risks discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, included in this Annual Report, may individually or in combination impact future results.
884219_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere, economic, competitive, governmental, technological, capital marketplace and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect financial condition or results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of Viad.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P3_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of $39.0 million and $31.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	During 2010 and 2009, unrealized foreign currency translation gains of $7.7 million and $25.1 million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses, gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As noted above, Viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in Canada and the United Kingdom.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange rate variances on segment operating results from Viad s Canadian and United Kingdom operations:
884219_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	As the Canadian operations generated aggregate operating income in 2010, Viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by $1.1 million from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	A hypothetical change of ten percent in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $1.9 million.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	As the United Kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in 2010, Viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by $52,000 from the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	A hypothetical change of ten percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $656,000.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2010 Viad had variable rate debt outstanding of $4.5 million under the Credit Facility.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Interest payments related to Viad s variable rate debt outstanding are indexed to LIBOR.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Assuming a hypothetical adverse change in short term interest rates of 50 and 100 basis points, Viad s 2010 income from continuing operations before income taxes would have been lower by approximately $200,000 and $230,000, respectively.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P12_S3	See Note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Periodically, Brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume, by fuel product, to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract, which is generally no longer than one year.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	The main objective of Viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins.
884219_11_ITEM7A_P14_S1	There were no fuel contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.
884219_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Refer to Index to Financial Statements on page 35 for required information.
884219_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

884219_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
884219_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
884219_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
884219_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, are provided in this Annual Report immediately prior to the Index to Financial Statements.

884219_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview: Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) operates in three reportable business segments: Marketing Events U.S., Marketing Events International and Travel Recreation Group.

884219_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment consists of Brewster Inc. ( Brewster ), Glacier Park, Inc. ( Glacier Park ) and Alaskan Park Properties, Inc. ( Alaskan Park Properties ).
884219_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Brewster provides tourism products and experiential services in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and in other parts of Western Canada.
884219_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Brewster s operations include the Banff Gondola, Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, motorcoach services, charter and sightseeing services, tour boat operations, inbound package tour operations and hotel operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Glacier Park operates five lodges, three motor inns and one four-season resort hotel and provides food and beverage operations, retail operations and tour and transportation services in and around Glacier National Park in Montana and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada.
884219_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Glacier Park is an 80 percent owned subsidiary of Viad.
884219_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Alaskan Park Properties operates the Denali Backcountry Lodge, which is the largest of three lodges located within Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, and the Denali Cabins, which are located near the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve.

884219_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Non-GAAP Measures: The following discussion includes a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses, which are utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Income before impairment losses is defined by Viad as income from continuing operations before the after-tax effect of impairment losses related to goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	Adjusted EBITDA is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation, debt service costs, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	Income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of non-cash impairment losses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are net income attributable to Viad and income from continuing operations attributable to Viad, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Although Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, the use of Adjusted EBITDA is limited because it does not consider material costs, expenses and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment losses or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Similarly, although Income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, its use is limited because it does not consider non-cash goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived asset impairment losses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	Because Adjusted EBITDA and Income before impairment losses do not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad and income from continuing operations attributable to Viad as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the Company s performance.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Viad is as follows: The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to higher segment operating results in the Marketing Events Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million from 2009 to 2010 was primarily driven by higher segment operating results at all operating segments and lower restructuring charges.
884219_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	See Results of Operations below for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	A reconciliation of income (loss) before impairment losses attributable to Viad to income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Viad is as follows: (1) Includes income tax benefits of $34,000 and $18.7 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Results of Operations: 2011 vs. 2010: Revenues for 2011 increased 11.6 percent to $942.4 million compared to $844.8 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $13.2 million for 2011 compared to $2.6 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	These increases were primarily due to higher revenues from the Marketing Events Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	Net restructuring charges in 2011 were $3.8 million compared to $4.2 million in 2010, both primarily related to the Marketing Events Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	Impairment losses for 2010 were $268,000 (after-tax), or $0.01 per diluted share.
884219_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	The Company did not record any impairment losses in 2011.
884219_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net income attributable to Viad for 2011 was $9.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $443,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	These results include income from discontinued operations of $451,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2011 and $262,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2010 relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	During 2011, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in increases in revenues and segment operating income of $14.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations: Accordingly, Viad s results were impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $631.4 million for 2011, up 10.6 percent compared to $571.0 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was primarily due to base same-show revenue increases of 11.2 percent, increased exhibitor spending, new business wins and positive show rotation of approximately $11 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Base same-shows represented 36.6 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2011.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	The 2011 segment operating loss was $6.3 million, compared to a loss of $15.2 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	The improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues, partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentives.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $218.6 million for 2011, up 10.5 percent compared to $197.8 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	Segment operating income was $11.4 million in 2011, compared to $10.1 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rates during 2011, resulting in increases of $9.8 million in revenue and $379,000 in segment operating income, as compared to 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P16_S7	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 revenues increased by $11.1 million, or 5.6 percent, and operating income increased by $982,000, or 9.7 percent.
884219_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	revenues was primarily due to new show wins, positive show rotation of approximately $4 million and same-show growth, which more than offset 2010 first quarter revenues from a major project for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Canada.
884219_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Operating results for 2011 reflect higher compensation expenses, including merit increases and the elimination of temporary wage reductions, as compared to 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenues are affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Following quarterly declines from the third quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010, Marketing Events U.S. base same-show revenues were essentially flat in the 2010 second quarter and have increased in each of the following six quarters.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	For 2012, management expects U.S. same-show revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate and that show rotation will not have a meaningful impact on revenues as revenue from non-annual shows during 2012 is expected to be comparable to revenues from non-annual shows that took place during 2011.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Additionally, management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2011 will have an unfavorable impact on the Marketing Events Group s 2012 revenues and operating income of approximately $9 million and $500,000, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	Management remains focused on improving the profitability of the Marketing Events U.S. segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	Consequently, management expects to record additional restructuring charges of approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of the continued reorganization activities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	Additional restructuring charges may be incurred as further cost structure improvements are made.
884219_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Marketing Events Group is subject to multiple collective-bargaining agreements that affect labor costs, about one-third of which expire each year.
884219_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Although labor relations between the Company and labor are currently stable, disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $101.8 million, up 15.3 percent compared to 2010 revenues of $88.3 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Segment operating income was $20.2 million, up 1.6 percent from 2010 segment operating income of $19.9 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Segment operating margins were 19.8 percent in 2011 compared to 22.5 percent in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rate variances during 2011, resulting in increases of $4.3 million and $1.3 million in revenues and segment operating income, respectively, as compared to 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 revenues increased by $9.2 million, or 10.5 percent, primarily due to the acquisitions of St. Mary Lodge Resort and Grouse Mountain Lodge, which are located near Glacier National Park, as well as organic revenue growth at Brewster.
884219_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	The Company acquired the 145-room Grouse Mountain Lodge on January 5, 2011 for $10.5 million in cash and the 115-room St. Mary Lodge Resort on June 29, 2011 for $15.3 million in cash.
884219_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Brewster realized growth across all of its lines of business with the exception of its transportation business, which had higher 2010 revenues resulting from charter contracts related to the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.
884219_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	These improvements were partially offset by lower revenues from Many Glacier Hotel, a property operated by Glacier Park, resulting from planned construction that reduced the number of rooms available during 2011 as compared to 2010, as well as lower visitation to Glacier National Park during July and August.
884219_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 segment operating income decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to the lower revenues at Many Glacier Hotel (which have a high flow through to operating income) and the seasonal fourth quarter operating loss at Alaskan Park Properties.
884219_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company acquired the 42-room Denali Backcountry Lodge and 46 Denali Cabins on September 16, 2011 for $15.3 million in cash.
884219_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	During 2011, approximately 70 percent of revenue and 86 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2011 will have an unfavorable impact on Travel Recreation Group segment 2012 revenues and operating income of approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Glacier Park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park.
884219_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Park Service, in its sole discretion, may continue extending Glacier Park s concession contract in one-year increments beyond 2012.
884219_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	When this contract ultimately expires, Glacier Park will have the opportunity to bid on a new concession contract.
884219_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	If Glacier Park does secure a new contract, possible terms would be for 10, 15 or 20 years.
884219_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Glacier Park generated approximately 45 percent of its 2011 revenue through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	If a new concessionaire is selected by the Park Service, Glacier Park s remaining business would consist of its operations at Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada; East Glacier, Montana; Whitefish, Montana and St. Mary, Montana.
884219_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	In such a circumstance, Glacier Park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract.
884219_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Glacier Park owns Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana and St. Mary Lodge Resort in St. Mary, Montana.
884219_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Glacier Park also owns the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, which is operated under a 42-year ground lease with the Canadian government running through January 31, 2052.
884219_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Glacier Park generated 19 percent of the Travel Recreation Group s 2011 segment operating income.
884219_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Corporate activities expense of $7.7 million in 2011 increased from $6.4 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	This increase was primarily due to higher legal fees related to employee benefits associated with previously divested operations and other matters.
884219_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	In 2011, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $3.8 million compared to $4.2 million in 2010 (the 2010 amount includes a reversal of restructuring reserves of $814,000 primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities).
884219_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	These charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of the elimination of certain positions as well as facility consolidations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The effective tax rate for 2011 was 29.5 percent compared to 68.1 percent for 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The relatively low rate for 2011 compared to the statutory rate was due to favorable tax resolutions of $103,000, state tax benefits of $100,000 and other tax benefits.
884219_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The relatively high rate for 2010 compared to the statutory rate was due to the write-off of deferred taxes of $1.3 million as a result of health care legislation, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $514,000.
884219_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Excluding the effects of these items, the 2010 effective rate was 38.2 percent.
884219_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	2010 vs. 2009: Revenues for 2010 increased 4.8 percent to $844.8 million compared to $805.8 million in 2009.

884219_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase was primarily due to positive show rotation of $15 million in revenue, mostly offset by reductions in brand marketer spending and a base same-show revenue decline of one percent.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Base same-shows represented 37.1 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The 2010 segment operating loss was $15.2 million, compared to a loss of $22.1 million in 2009.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	The improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues, overhead reductions of approximately $10 million versus 2009 and productivity improvements driven by the Company s Lean initiatives, partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentives (which were not significant in 2009) and pricing pressures.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $197.8 million for 2010, up 14.6 percent compared to $172.6 million in 2009.

884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S8	The increase in revenue primarily resulted from market share gains, improving industry trends, a major project for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Canada and positive show rotation of $3 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S9	The improved operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues, partially offset by performance-based incentives and the reinstatement of full wages after a temporary reduction in 2009.

884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S13	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2010 revenues increased by $8.6 million, or 11.4 percent, primarily due to initiatives to capture incremental spend per guest as well as stronger demand for the Company s tourism services that was partly related to the centennial anniversary of Glacier National Park and the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S14	During 2010, approximately 73 percent of revenue and 79 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S15	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income from the Travel Recreation Group segment.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S16	Corporate activities expense of $6.4 million in 2010 increased from $5.6 million in 2009.
884219_12_ITEM7_P35_S17	This increase was primarily due to higher performance-based compensation expense in 2010 as compared to performance-based compensation expense reversals in 2009, partially offset by lower consulting fees in 2010.

884219_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The effective tax rate for 2010 was 68.1 percent compared to 21.5 percent for 2009.
884219_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The relatively high rate for 2010 compared to the statutory rate was due to the write-off of deferred taxes of $1.3 million as a result of health care legislation, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $514,000.
884219_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Excluding the effects of these items, the 2010 effective rate was 38.2 percent.
884219_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	The relatively low rate for 2009 compared to the statutory rate was due to the effect of certain nondeductible impairment losses of $26.8 million, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $3.5 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	Excluding the effects of these items, the 2009 effective rate was 39.0 percent.
884219_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources: Cash and cash equivalents were $100.4 million as of December 31, 2011 as compared to $145.8 million as of December 31, 2010, with the decrease primarily due to Viad s acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash flow from operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	During 2011, the Company generated net cash flows from operating activities of $34.7 million primarily driven by operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.
884219_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	Management believes that Viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $64.1 million of its cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States.
884219_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Of the total amount, $56.0 million was held in Canada, $6.5 million in the United Kingdom and $1.6 million in Germany.
884219_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Although the Company records income tax expense with respect to its foreign operations at the statutory tax rates in effect in the United States, there were certain historical earnings related to its Canadian operations which, if repatriated to the United States, would result in incremental income tax expense.
884219_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The incremental tax liability as of December 31, 2011 that would result assuming all foreign cash balances were repatriated to the United States would be approximately $2.0 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Viad s total debt as of December 31, 2011 was $3.2 million compared to $9.1 million as of December 31, 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	The debt-to-capital ratio was 0.008 to 1 as of December 31, 2011 compared with 0.023 to 1 as of December 31, 2010.
884219_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Capital is defined as total debt and capital lease obligations plus total stockholders equity.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Effective May 18, 2011, Viad amended and restated its secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility ).
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Credit Facility provides for a $130 million revolving line of credit, which may be increased up to an additional $50 million under certain circumstances.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The term of the Credit Facility is five years (expiring on May 18, 2016) and borrowings are to be used for general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions) and to support up to $50 million of letters of credit.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	The lenders have a first perfected security interest in all of the personal property of Viad and GES, including 65 percent of the capital stock of top-tier foreign subsidiaries.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	In April 2011, Viad paid off its outstanding borrowing under the previous credit facility of $4.2 million and as of December 31, 2011, Viad s total debt of $3.2 million consisted entirely of capital lease obligations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had $125.4 million of capacity remaining under its Credit Facility reflecting outstanding letters of credit of $4.6 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	Borrowings under the Credit Facility (of which GES is a guarantor) are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus appropriate spreads tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S7	Commitment fees and letters of credit fees are also tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S8	The fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility are currently 0.35 percent annually.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S9	As part of the amendment, Viad s financial covenants were revised to include a fixed-charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.25 to 1 (and a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1 after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2012) and a leverage ratio (defined as total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 2.50 to 1.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S10	Additionally, Viad must maintain a consolidated minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of $50 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P42_S11	As of December 31, 2011, the fixed-charge coverage and leverage ratios were 2.94 to 1 and 0.30 to 1, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility allow Viad to pay up to $10 million in dividends in the aggregate in any calendar year and also allow the Company to purchase up to $10 million in any calendar year of the Company s common stock.
884219_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Significant other covenants include limitations on: investments, additional indebtedness, sales/leases of assets, acquisitions, consolidations or mergers and liens on property.
884219_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2011, Viad was in compliance with all covenants.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by the Company s subsidiary operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2011 would be $28.5 million.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities and expire through October 2017.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Capital expenditures for 2011 totaled $21.5 million and primarily related to the purchase of rental inventory, equipment and computer hardware primarily at the Marketing Events U.S. segment.
884219_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Capital expenditures for 2010 totaled $17.0 million and primarily related to the purchase of rental inventory, equipment and computer hardware primarily at the Marketing Events U.S. segment and building improvements and equipment at the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	On January 5, 2011, Viad completed the acquisition of Grouse Mountain Lodge for $10.5 million in cash.

884219_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Banff International Hotel is a 162-guest room commercial hotel located in Banff, Alberta, Canada.
884219_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	In 2012, management anticipates incurring an estimated $20 million on the development of the Glacier Discovery Walk, a 1,312-foot guided interpretive walkway with a 98-foot glass-floored observation area overlooking the Sunwapta Valley at the Tangle Ridge Viewpoint in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada.
884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	In March 2010, Viad completed the sale of a non-strategic real estate asset for $14.3 million (net of selling costs).
884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Viad has announced its intent to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices.
884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	During 2011 and 2010, Viad repurchased 250,760 shares for $4.6 million and 356,300 shares for $6.3 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	As of December 31, 2011, 53,621 shares remain available for repurchase from the announced authorization.
884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Additionally, during 2011 and 2010, the Company repurchased 28,627 shares for $679,000 and 28,407 shares for $573,000, respectively, related to tax withholding requirements on share-based awards.

884219_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	During 2010, Viad received income tax refunds of $5.6 million related to carryback claims associated with 2009 operating losses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table presents Viad s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011:
884219_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) Estimated contributions related to multi-employer benefit plans are excluded from the table above.
884219_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	See Note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding those obligations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	(2) Purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
884219_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	(3) Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $27.1 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	See Note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2011 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
884219_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	As of December 31, 2011, there was a remaining environmental remediation liability of $5.8 million related to previously sold operations of which $755,000 is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Other current liabilities and $5.0 million under the caption Other deferred items and liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $19.6 million, $15.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Viad does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
884219_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	See Notes 10, 18 and 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The SEC has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including: the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had total goodwill of $133.7 million consisting of $84.9 million related to the Marketing Events Group and $48.8 million related to the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	Within the Marketing Events Group, goodwill of $62.7 million relates to the Marketing Events U.S. segment and $22.2 million to the Marketing Events International segment.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events U.S. segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level, which represents all domestic operations of GES.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S8	Furthermore, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events International segment is assigned to and tested at the component level within the segment s geographical operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S9	As of December 31, 2011, the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting units in the United Kingdom (Melville) and Canada was $13.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S10	Also, as of December 31, 2011, the Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaskan Park Properties operating segments (within the Travel Recreation Group) had goodwill of $41.2 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million (acquired September 2011), respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P57_S11	Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaskan Park Properties are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Furthermore, the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had aggregate goodwill of $133.7 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Furthermore, as a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2011, the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test was 89 percent, 43 percent and 30 percent for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom (Melville) and Canada, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	For the Brewster and Glacier Park reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 44 percent and 48 percent, respectively, as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenue, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in additional impairment losses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	Furthermore, management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the Company as ongoing declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment.
884219_12_ITEM7_P60_S5	See Results of Operations above and Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of goodwill impairment losses recorded during 2009.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S5	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $70.7 million and $67.1 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history and projected taxable income, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P61_S8	Furthermore, Viad also considered the fact that goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible and thus did not contribute to tax losses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had a valuation allowance of $356,000 and $411,000, respectively, related to certain state deferred tax assets.
884219_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	If such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Insurance liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability and property loss claims.
884219_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to Viad s continuing operations was $21.1 million as of December 31, 2011.
884219_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Of this total, $14.3 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $6.8 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	Viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling $6.0 million as of December 31, 2011, primarily related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $200,000 to $500,000 on a per claim basis.
884219_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $7.6 million, $6.8 million and $8.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.6 million to its funded pension plans and $952,000 to its unfunded pension plans in 2012.
884219_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $450,000 to the plans in 2012.
884219_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2011 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine and one-half percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by approximately $1.7 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $112,000.
884219_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $93,000.
884219_12_ITEM7_P69_S4	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows: The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	See Note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan which has a ten-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $4.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	Furthermore, the total tax benefits related to such costs were $1.6 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2011, 2010 or 2009.
884219_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price until the time of settlement.
884219_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility; the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding; the expected dividend yield on Viad common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	See Note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Viad s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Forward-Looking Statements: As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of Viad.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of $34.6 million and $39.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	During 2011 and 2010, an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $4.3 million and a gain of $7.7 million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses, gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	As noted above, Viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in Canada and the United Kingdom.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange rate variances on segment operating results from Viad s Canadian and United Kingdom operations: As the Canadian operations generated aggregate operating income in 2011, Viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by $1.3 million from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	A hypothetical change of ten percent in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $1.9 million.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As the United Kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in 2011, Viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by $445,000 from the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A hypothetical change of ten percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $951,000.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Periodically, Brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume, by fuel product, to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract, which is generally no longer than one year.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The main objective of Viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins.
884219_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	There were no fuel contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
884219_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	controls and procedures has been evaluated as of December 31, 2011, and, based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2011.

884219_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

884219_12_ITEM15_P5_S0	Directors Wayne G. Allcott Daniel Boggan Jr.
884219_12_ITEM15_P6_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P7_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
884219_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
884219_12_ITEM15_P10_S2	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_12_ITEM15_P10_S3	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page 32 of this Annual Report.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_12_ITEM15_P11_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_12_ITEM15_P12_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, of the Company and our report dated March 9, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates.
884219_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
884219_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:
884219_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Viad considers all highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
884219_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Viad s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank demand deposits, bank time deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company s investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or market.
884219_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Viad capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software.
884219_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	These costs are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_12_ITEM15_P33_S3	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_12_ITEM15_P33_S4	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance.
884219_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Viad has Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash the Company could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in the consolidated statements of operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims.
884219_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Viad has also retained certain liabilities related to workers compensation and general liability insurance claims in conjunction with previously sold operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s prior historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels.
884219_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Viad has retained certain liabilities representing the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations primarily associated with previously sold operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	The amounts accrued primarily consist of the estimated direct incremental costs, on an undiscounted basis, for contractor and other services related to remedial actions and post-remediation site monitoring.
884219_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when the specific obligation is considered probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
884219_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Subsequent recoveries from third parties, if any, are recorded through discontinued operations when realized.

884219_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Viad applies the two-class method in calculating income per common share as unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.
884219_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	Accordingly, such securities are included in the earnings allocation in calculating income per share.
884219_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	Furthermore, Viad funds its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) feature of the Company s 401(k) defined contribution plan.

884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	The new guidance is intended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and also changes certain principles and disclosures.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S4	In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income, which is codified in ASC Topic 220.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S5	The new guidance requires entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in one of two formats: 1) in a single continuous statement, or 2) in two separate but consecutive statements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S6	The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and will not have an impact on Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S7	In September 2011, the FASB issued new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing, which is codified in ASC Topic 350.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S8	The new guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S9	If, after performing the assessment, an entity determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S10	The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
884219_12_ITEM15_P52_S11	The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Viad s financial condition or results of operations.

884219_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	No stock options were granted in 2011 or 2009.
884219_12_ITEM15_P58_S3	The following table summarizes information concerning stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2011:
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	prior to the spin-off of that company.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2011, there were 5,889 of such options outstanding and exercisable, both with exercise prices ranging from $19.57 to $26.07.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	The weighted-average remaining contractual life of these options outstanding was less than one year.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	During 2011, 100 options were exercised by MoneyGram participants at an exercise price of $19.57.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S4	Stock options granted in 2010 were for a term of ten years and become exercisable one third after one year, another third after two years and the balance after three years from the date of grant.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S5	Stock options granted between 2004 and 2008 were for contractual terms of seven years and become exercisable, based on a graded vesting schedule, in annual increments of 20 percent beginning one year after the grant date and become fully exercisable after five years from the date of grant.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S6	Stock options granted in 2003 were for a term of ten years and became exercisable one third after one year, another third after two years and the balance after three years from the date of grant.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S7	Stock options granted in calendar years 2002 and prior were for a contractual term of ten years and were exercisable 50 percent after one year from the date of grant with the balance exercisable after two years from the date of grant.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S8	The fair value of the 2010 stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming Viad s expected stock price volatility of 33.2 percent, a five year expected period of time the stock options will remain outstanding, an expected dividend yield on Viad common stock of 0.8 percent and a risk-free interest rate estimate of 2.44 percent.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S9	The expected dividend yield was based on Viad s expectation of future dividend payouts.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S10	The volatility assumption was based on Viad s daily historical stock price volatility during the time period that corresponds to the expected weighted-average life of the option.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S11	The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of stock options granted was estimated based on historical exercise activity.
884219_12_ITEM15_P59_S12	The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the interest rate of a U.S. Treasury strip for a five-year term from the date the option was granted.
884219_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Additional information pertaining to stock options is provided in the table below:
884219_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding in the table above represents the difference between Viad s closing stock price on December 31 of each year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options.
884219_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	The intrinsic value of stock options outstanding therefore changes based on changes in the fair market value of Viad s common stock.
884219_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Impairment Losses During 2010, Viad recorded impairment losses of $302,000 at the Travel Recreation Group.

884219_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	During 2009, Viad revised downward its forecast for future revenues and earnings in the Marketing Events Group based on continued declines in trade show marketing spending by its customers and a sharper than expected decline in retail holiday d cor demand.
884219_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	As a result, the Company had projected a more prolonged contraction in its trade show and retail marketing revenues than was previously anticipated.

884219_12_ITEM15_P65_S6	Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaskan Park Properties are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_12_ITEM15_P65_S7	As a result of the Company s most recent analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2011, the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test was 89 percent, 43 percent and 30 percent for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom (Melville) and Canada, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P65_S8	For the Brewster and Glacier Park reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 44 percent and 48 percent, respectively, as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_12_ITEM15_P65_S9	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenue, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional impairment testing, which may result in additional impairment losses.

884219_12_ITEM15_P91_S7	The fair value of debt was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity.
884219_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	The fair value of an asset or liability is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
884219_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The fair value guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
884219_12_ITEM15_P92_S3	Level 3 Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value.
884219_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	Viad measures its money market mutual funds and certain other mutual fund investments at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.
884219_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following tables:
884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had investments in money market mutual funds of $20.9 million and $31.3 million, respectively, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Cash and cash equivalents.

884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	There have been no realized or unrealized gains or losses related to these investments and the Company has not experienced any redemption restrictions with respect to any of the money market mutual funds.
884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had investments in other mutual funds of $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which are classified in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Other investments and assets.
884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S4	These investments were classified as available-for-sale and were recorded at fair value.
884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S5	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were unrealized gains of $366,000 ($222,000 after-tax) and $462,000 ($282,000 after-tax), respectively, which were included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
884219_12_ITEM15_P94_S6	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of diluted and basic per share computations for net income (loss) attributable to Viad:
884219_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	(1) Diluted income per share amount cannot exceed basic income per share.
884219_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	Options to purchase 304,000, 474,000 and 627,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of dilutive shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
884219_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	Additionally, 336,000 and 322,000 share-based compensation awards were considered dilutive and included in the computation of diluted income per share in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P96_S3	During 2009, 294,000 share-based compensation awards, that would normally have been considered dilutive and thus included as outstanding for purposes of computing diluted income per share, were excluded due to a net loss reported in 2009, thereby making such shares anti-dilutive.
884219_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	Employee Stock Ownership Plan Viad funds its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s ESOP portion of the Viad Corp Capital Accumulation Plan (the 401(k) Plan ).
884219_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	All eligible employees of Viad and its participating affiliates, other than certain employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements that do not expressly provide for participation of such employees in an employee stock ownership plan, may participate in the employee stock ownership feature within the 401(k) Plan.
884219_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	In 1989, the ESOP borrowed $40.0 million (guaranteed by Viad) to purchase treasury shares from the Company.
884219_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	In July 2004, Viad borrowed $12.4 million under its revolving credit agreement to pay in full the outstanding ESOP loan and obtain release of Viad from its guarantee of the loan.
884219_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	In connection with the loan payoff, the ESOP entered into a $12.4 million loan with Viad maturing in June 2009 calling for minimum quarterly principal payments of $250,000 plus interest.
884219_12_ITEM15_P98_S3	The same amount, representing unearned employee benefits, was recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity.
884219_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	In 2007, the loan agreement between the ESOP and Viad was extended to December 31, 2016.
884219_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the balance of the ESOP loan was $3.0 million and is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Unearned employee benefits and other.
884219_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	The liability is reduced as the ESOP makes principal payments on the borrowing, and the amount offsetting stockholders equity is reduced as stock is allocated to employees and benefits are charged to expense.
884219_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Information regarding ESOP transactions is as follows:
884219_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Shares were released for allocation to participants based upon the ratio of the current year s principal and interest payments to the sum of the total principal and interest payments expected over the remaining life of the plan.
884219_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Viad recorded expense of $1.6 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P101_S2	Unallocated shares held by the 401(k) Plan totaled 293,280 and 440,369 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P101_S3	Shares allocated during 2011 and 2010 totaled 147,089 and 149,490, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	( Right ) outstanding on each outstanding share of its common stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan (the Rights Agreement ) adopted by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2002, as adjusted in connection with Viad s one-for-four reverse stock split on July 1, 2004, and as amended on February 28, 2012.
884219_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	that all of Viad s shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and in protecting Viad and its shareholders from abusive takeover tactics.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	Each Right represents the right to purchase one twenty-fifth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, Rights become exercisable ten days following the public announcement of the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of Viad s outstanding common stock.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	If such a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the common stock, each Right (other than such person s or group s Rights, which will become void) will entitle the holder to purchase, at the Right s then-current exercise price, Viad s common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S3	Moreover, at any time after a person or group acquires 20 percent or more of Viad s outstanding common stock (unless such person or group acquires 50 percent or more), the Board of Directors may exchange one share of Viad s common stock for each outstanding right (other than rights owned by such person or group, which would have become void).
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S4	In addition, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 20 percent or more of Viad s outstanding common stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right s then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value of twice the exercise price.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S5	The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at an initial redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time before any person or group acquires 20 percent or more of Viad s outstanding common stock.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S6	If not redeemed, the Rights will expire on February 28, 2015, subject to early termination on February 28, 2013, if the Rights Agreement is not ratified by shareholders before such date.
884219_12_ITEM15_P103_S7	In addition, if Viad receives a qualifying offer (which includes certain all-cash fully financed tender offers or exchange offers for all of Viad s outstanding common stock), under certain circumstances, holders of 10 percent of Viad s outstanding common stock (excluding shares held by the offeror and its affiliates and associates) may direct the Board of Directors to call a special meeting of shareholders to consider a resolution exempting such qualifying offer from the Rights Agreement.
884219_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	Viad has authorized 5 million and 2 million shares of Preferred Stock and Junior Participating Preferred Stock, respectively, none of which is outstanding.
884219_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	The 2 million shares of Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been reserved for issuance in connection with the Rights.
884219_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) and the amount that would be computed using the statutory federal income tax rates: In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a related measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, were both enacted into law.
884219_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	As a result of this legislation, the tax deductions for the portion of the prescription drug costs for which Viad receives a Medicare Part D subsidy have been eliminated for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012.
884219_12_ITEM15_P105_S2	Accordingly, during 2010, Viad reduced its deferred tax asset related to its postretirement benefit plan liability to reflect the change in the tax law.
884219_12_ITEM15_P105_S3	The reduction in the deferred tax asset resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $1.3 million in 2010.
884219_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	Viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts or had previously conducted operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	These include U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions, and certain foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.
884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S4	During 2011 and 2010, Viad recorded tax-related interest expense credits of $146,000 and $261,000, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S5	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of $103,000, $514,000 and $3.5 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S6	These tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S7	In addition to the above, Viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $636,000 as of both December 31, 2011 and 2010.

884219_12_ITEM15_P107_S10	Viad does not expect any of the unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized during the next 12 months.
884219_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of the total amounts of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties): Viad s 2008 through 2011 U.S. federal tax years and various state tax years from 2007 through 2011 remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities.

884219_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	In addition, tax years from 2007 through 2011 related to Viad s foreign taxing jurisdictions also remain subject to examination.

884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S5	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $70.7 million and $67.1 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history and projected taxable income, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S8	Furthermore, Viad also considered the fact that goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible and thus did not contribute to tax losses.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S9	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had state net operating loss carryforwards of $91.9 million and $79.0 million, respectively, for which the Company had deferred tax assets of $2.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P110_S10	The state net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates from 2016 through 2031.
884219_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Viad had a valuation allowance of $356,000 and $411,000, respectively, related to those state deferred tax assets.
884219_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S3	If such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S4	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had tax credit carryforwards related to alternative minimum tax of $9.9 million that may be carried forward indefinitely.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S5	Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, Viad had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $15.3 million, of which $1.9 million expire in 2019, $8.3 million expire in 2020 and $5.1 million expire in 2021.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S6	Viad has not recorded deferred taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiaries as management intends to reinvest those earnings in its Canadian operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S7	As of December 31, 2011, the incremental unrecognized tax liability (net of estimated foreign tax credits) related to those undistributed earnings was approximately $2.3 million.
884219_12_ITEM15_P113_S8	To the extent that circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of those undistributed earnings will be remitted to the U.S., Viad would accrue income taxes attributable to such remittance.
884219_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:
884219_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded tax deficiencies of $325,000, $524,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted stock and PBRS and the exercise of stock options, which were recorded as charges to stockholders equity.

884219_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Viad also has certain defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_12_ITEM15_P119_S2	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad may fund the plans.

884219_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	The estimated net actuarial loss for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is approximately $617,000.
884219_12_ITEM15_P123_S2	The estimated prior service credit for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit credit in 2012 is approximately $1.1 million.
884219_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	The fair value of the domestic plans assets by asset class were as follows:
884219_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	Viad employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income securities is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
884219_12_ITEM15_P125_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
884219_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities.
884219_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	Furthermore, equity securities are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth and value.
884219_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	Viad utilizes a building-block approach in determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.
884219_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
884219_12_ITEM15_P128_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
884219_12_ITEM15_P128_S3	The long-term portfolio return also considers diversification and rebalancing.
884219_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed relative to Viad s assumed rates for reasonableness and appropriateness.

884219_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	In aggregate for both the domestic and foreign plans, the Company anticipates contributing $1.6 million to the funded pension plans, $952,000 to the unfunded pension plans and $450,000 to the postretirement benefit plans in 2012.
884219_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows: Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2011 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine and one-half percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by approximately $1.7 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $112,000.
884219_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $93,000.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Viad contributes to defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	The financial risks of participating in these multi-employer pension plans generally include the fact that assets contributed to the plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	Furthermore, if a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S3	In addition, if Viad were to discontinue its participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S4	Viad also contributes to defined contribution plans pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements, which are generally not subject to the funding risks inherent in defined benefit pension plans.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S5	The overall level of Viad s contributions to its multi-employer plans may significantly vary from year-to-year based on the demand for union-represented labor to support the Company s operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S6	Viad does not have any minimum contribution requirements for future periods pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements for individually significant multi-employer plans.
884219_12_ITEM15_P142_S7	Contributions to multi-employer pension plans totaled $19.6 million, $15.3 million and $15.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

884219_12_ITEM15_P146_S3	These legacy restructuring liabilities represent the remaining contractual lease obligations on certain facilities, and are subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes in estimated sublease activity and other factors.
884219_12_ITEM15_P146_S4	These adjustments can result in reversals of previously recorded amounts, or additional charges in some cases.
884219_12_ITEM15_P146_S5	The table below represents a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability balances by major restructuring activity:
884219_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the liability of $831,000 and $24,000 related to severance and employee benefits in the Marketing Events Group consolidation and other restructurings, respectively, is expected to be paid by the end of 2012.

884219_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	Litigation, Claims, Contingencies and Other Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_12_ITEM15_P151_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2011 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.

884219_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by Viad s subsidiary operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2011 would be $28.5 million.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities expiring through October 2017.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_12_ITEM15_P153_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and the Company is a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	As of December 31, 2011, approximately 34 percent of Viad s regular full-time employees are covered by collective-bargaining agreements.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	If the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	Viad believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2012 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse effect on Viad s operations.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S4	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S5	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $19.6 million, $15.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively.
884219_12_ITEM15_P154_S6	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_12_ITEM15_P155_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.

884219_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Although Viad believes that Glacier Park is well-positioned to win the new contract, if the Park Service selects a new concessionaire, Glacier Park would be entitled to $25 million for its possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract, plus an estimated $5 million for the personal property Glacier Park uses at the facilities covered by the concession contract.

884219_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Government Regulation Compliance with legal requirements and government regulations represents a normal cost of doing business.
884219_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	The principal regulations affecting the day-to-day businesses are rules and regulations relating to transportation (such as regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and its state counterparts), employees (such as regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines implemented pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act and general federal and state employment laws), unionized labor (such as guidelines imposed by the National Labor Relations Act) and U.S. and Canadian regulations relating to national parks (such as regulations established by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Park Service).
884219_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Employees Viad s businesses had approximately 3,930 employees as of December 31, 2012 as follows:
884219_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Viad believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2013 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without a material adverse effect on Viad s operations.

884219_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Viad s Board of Directors authorized management to explore and evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a potential separation of its Travel Recreation and Marketing Events business groups.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	The Company engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor to assist in this evaluation process.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	No decision has been made to separate the two business groups, and Viad cannot assure that it will identify and undertake a transaction that allows its shareholders to realize an increase in the value of Viad s stock or provide any guidance on the timing of any such action.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Viad also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to its shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond Viad s control, including, among other factors, the U.S. and global economic and market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in Viad s businesses and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Viad s businesses and operating results are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Viad s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by increases and decreases in the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Operating results for the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the operating results for the Marketing Events Group are adversely affected.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Similarly, many of the retail shopping mall and lifestyle center clients of the Marketing Events Group may reduce marketing expenditures when economic conditions deteriorate.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenues from the Travel Recreation Group businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Viad s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Viad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Viad has not hedged its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenue, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	During 2012, $223.5 million of revenue and $11.7 million of segment operating income was derived through Canadian and United Kingdom operations of the International segment.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, $80.6 million of 2012 revenue and $18.3 million of 2012 segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	For this segment, Canadian operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and, therefore, revenue and segment operating income in the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Exhibition rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer).
884219_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than when they have historically been held.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins in a given period if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	As a consequence of these factors, the operating results for these businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees or others, to travel.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities could adversely impact revenue.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Although no single client accounts for more than 5.2 percent of the revenue of any of Viad s reporting segments, the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments have a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The loss of any of these large clients would adversely affect Viad s results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, revenue of the Marketing Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing or other services.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	When the Marketing Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the show organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform these electrical and plumbing services, subject in each case to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, some of these facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of these services.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing Events Group has these relationships moves these services in-house, Viad s revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The business activities of the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take those customers to a competitor.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any acquisition can involve a number of risks, including: the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Marketing Events U.S. segment generally reports its highest revenue during the first quarter of each year, while the Marketing Events International segment generally reports its highest revenue during the second quarter of each year.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Travel Recreation Group businesses are also seasonal, experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These quarters accounted for 87 percent of the segment s 2012 revenue.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could adversely affect the operating results of Viad s businesses.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	From time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays and cost overruns, failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals and the inability to successfully integrate into Viad s ongoing businesses, as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with Viad s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. and International segments rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities and customer facilities.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If they were unable to secure the services of these independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on these businesses and their results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on these businesses and operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Similarly, disruption of transportation services could adversely affect the ability of the Marketing Events Group to supply time-sensitive holiday-themed exhibits and experiences to retail shopping mall and lifestyle center customers and could cause the cancellation of the exhibits and experiences.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In either event, Viad s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Moreover, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could adversely affect the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans to which Viad contributes may have an adverse impact on operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Viad s contributions to these multi-employer plans in 2012 and 2011 totaled $20.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Viad does not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to these plans.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have an adverse impact on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Competition in the exhibition and events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting operating results.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If Viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment, results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over seven decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food and fresh meats.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Some of these businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, the subject of litigation.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by these businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover these future liabilities, results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions, and reserves or insurance become inadequate.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad s business.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Such catastrophic events could impact the Company s production facilities preventing Viad from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and also could cause a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels and other public venues.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Such catastrophic events also could cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues.
884219_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, Viad could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition.
884219_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	which are leased and approximate 24,700 square feet, are located at 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900 in Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565.
884219_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. segment operates 15 offices and 26 multi-use facilities (manufacturing, sales and design, office and/or warehouse and truck marshaling yards).
884219_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 592,100 square feet.
884219_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	Three of the multi-use facilities are owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Marketing Events International segment operates four offices and twenty multi-use facilities, with two offices and nine multi-use facilities in Canada, seven multi-use facilities in the United Kingdom, two multi-use facilities in Germany, one office and two multi-use facilities in the United Arab Emirates and one office in the Netherlands.
884219_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 134,000 square feet.
884219_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	One of the multi-use facilities is owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment operates four offices, 17 retail stores, one bus terminal, four garages, an icefield tour facility, a gondola lift operation, a boat tour facility, 13 hotels/lodges (including ancillary foodservice and recreational facilities) and 46 guest cabins.
884219_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	All of the facilities are in the United States or Canada.
884219_13_ITEM2_P3_S2	The bus terminal, three garages and the boat tour facility are owned and one garage is leased.
884219_13_ITEM2_P3_S3	The icefield tour facility and gondola lift operation are operated through lease agreements with Parks Canada and all other properties are leased.
884219_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group owns eight of the 13 hotels/lodges it operates and all of the guest cabins, while the remaining five hotels/lodges are operated pursuant to the Glacier Park concession contract.
884219_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	As shown by the charts below, the eight hotels and lodges and the guest cabins account for 922 of the 1,432 rooms managed by the Travel Recreation Group:
884219_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	Management believes that the Company s facilities in the aggregate are adequate and suitable for their purposes and that capacity is sufficient for current needs.
884219_13_ITEM2_P6_S0	Viad and certain subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_13_ITEM2_P6_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_13_ITEM2_P6_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2012 with respect to certain of these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial condition or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM2_P7_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_13_ITEM2_P7_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_13_ITEM2_P7_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure for actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_13_ITEM2_P7_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

884219_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The common stock is also admitted for trading on the Chicago and National Exchanges.
884219_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Regular quarterly dividends were paid on Viad s common stock on the first business day of January, April, July and October.
884219_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	The terms of Viad s $130 million secured revolving credit facility, amended and restated as of May 18, 2011, (the Credit Facility ) restrict Viad from paying more than $10 million in dividends in the aggregate in any calendar year.
884219_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	Effective December 12, 2012, the Credit Facility was amended to change the limitation on restricted payments.
884219_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	Unless the Company s leverage ratio is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default exists, additional dividends over the $10 million limitation, repurchase of shares and distributions on capital stock are allowed.

884219_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, the Marketing Events Group provides a variety of immersive, entertaining attractions and brand-based experiences, sponsored events, mobile marketing and other branded entertainment and face-to-face marketing solutions for clients and venues, including shopping malls, movie studios, museums and leading consumer brands.
884219_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment consists of Brewster Inc. ( Brewster ), Glacier Park, Inc. ( Glacier Park ) and Alaskan Park Properties, Inc. ( Alaska Denali Travel ).
884219_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Brewster provides tourism products and experiential services in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and in other parts of Western Canada.
884219_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Brewster s operations include the Banff Gondola, Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, motorcoach services, charter and sightseeing services, tour boat operations, inbound package tour operations and hotel operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Glacier Park operates five lodges, three motor inns and one four-season resort hotel and provides food and beverage operations, retail operations and tour and transportation services in and around Glacier National Park in Montana and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada.
884219_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Glacier Park is an 80 percent owned subsidiary of Viad.
884219_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Alaska Denali Travel operates the Denali Backcountry Lodge, which is the largest of three lodges located within Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, and the Denali Cabins, which are located near the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve.
884219_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition to lodging, Alaska Denali Travel also provides food and beverage operations and package tour and transportation services in and around Denali National Park and Preserve.
884219_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	On December 14, 2012, Viad announced that the Board of Directors authorized management to explore and evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a potential separation of its Travel Recreation and Marketing Events business groups.
884219_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Viad engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor to assist in this evaluation process.
884219_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Non-GAAP Measure: The following discussion includes a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Adjusted EBITDA is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation, debt service costs, impairment losses and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA primarily as a performance measure and believes that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP measure is net income attributable to Viad.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Although Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, the use of Adjusted EBITDA is limited because it does not consider material costs, expenses and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment losses or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Because Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the Company s performance.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $14.9 million from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher segment operating results at all operating segments, partially offset by higher restructuring charges and corporate costs.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million from 2010 to 2011 was primarily driven by higher segment operating results in the Marketing Events Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	See Results of Operations below for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	Results of Operations: 2012 vs. 2011: Revenues for 2012 increased 8.8 percent to $1.0 billion, as compared to $942.4 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S7	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $26.8 million for 2012, as compared to $13.2 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S8	These increases were primarily due to same-show growth, new business wins, positive show rotation revenue of approximately $16 million from non-annual shows that took place during 2012 and continued focus on operating efficiencies at Viad s Marketing Events Group, as well as the first peak season contributions from Alaska Denali Travel and the Banff International Hotel, the newly renovated rooms at the Many Glacier Hotel and organic growth at the Company s Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P11_S9	Net restructuring charges in 2012 were $4.9 million, as compared to $3.8 million in 2011, both primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of facility consolidations, as well as the elimination of certain positions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net income attributable to Viad for 2012 was $5.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared to $9.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	These results include a charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million representing a valuation allowance established for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	These results also include income from discontinued operations of $624,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2012 primarily related to the sale of land associated with previously sold operations and $451,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2011 relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	During 2012, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in decreases in revenues and segment operating income of $6.6 million and $886,000, respectively, as compared to 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations: Accordingly, Viad s results were impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $676.8 million for 2012, up 7.2 percent, as compared to $631.4 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase was primarily due to base same-show revenue increases of 6.5 percent and positive show rotation of approximately $21 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management defines base same-show revenues as revenues from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Base same-shows represented 41.5 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The 2012 segment operating income was $5.6 million, as compared to a loss of $6.3 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The improved operating results were primarily due to an increase in revenues with a continued focus on margin improvements, as well as ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies and control discretionary expenses.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	The Company is continuing to execute against a number of margin improvement initiatives designed to more effectively manage labor costs across the Marketing Events Group and to reduce the physical footprint and the overhead associated with the U.S. warehousing operation.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	As it relates to labor costs, the focus is on driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning on the highest opportunity events.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	The benefits of such measures are shown by a half point reduction in the variable labor-to-revenue ratio on a U.S. base same-show basis.
884219_13_ITEM7_P15_S7	The Company is also working to develop new tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement and benchmarking.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	On the facility side, approximately 449,000 square feet of warehouse space has been eliminated during 2012, reducing the total U.S. warehouse footprint to approximately 2.4 million square feet as of December 31, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Due to the cost savings efforts, the Company has recognized a U.S. facility cost savings of approximately $2.0 million for 2012, as compared to 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $240.1 million for 2012, up 9.8 percent, as compared to $218.6 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Segment operating income was $12.3 million in 2012, as compared to $11.4 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $4.6 million and segment operating income of $160,000, as compared to 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2012 revenues increased by $26.1 million, or 11.9 percent, and operating income increased by $1.0 million, or 9.0 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	These increases were primarily driven by services provided for the 2012 London Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, as well as increased demand and new show wins, partially offset by net negative show rotation revenues of approximately $5 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenues are affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Following quarterly declines from the third quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010, Marketing Events U.S. base same-show revenues were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2010 and have increased in each of the following nine quarters.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Base same-show revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012 were essentially flat, reflecting growth across the majority of base same-shows offset by a decline in a major show in the government sector.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	For the 2013 full year, management expects U.S. base same-show revenues to increase at a low to mid-single digit rate and show rotation to have a net negative impact on full year revenue of approximately $55 million to $60 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	Although the Marketing Events Group will not benefit from non-annual shows in 2013 as it did in 2012, management expects to reach a full year operating margin of approximately 2.5 percent in 2013 through improved operating efficiencies and new business wins.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S5	Additionally, management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2012 will not have a meaningful impact on the Marketing Events Group s 2013 full year revenues and segment operating income.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S6	Management remains focused on improving the profitability of the Marketing Events U.S. segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs.
884219_13_ITEM7_P18_S7	Additional restructuring charges may be incurred as further cost structure improvements are made.
884219_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Marketing Events Group is subject to multiple collective-bargaining agreements that affect labor costs, about one-third of which expire each year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Although labor relations between the Company and labor are currently stable, disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $123.2 million, up 21.0 percent, as compared to 2011 revenues of $101.8 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Segment operating income was $24.0 million, up 18.6 percent from 2011 segment operating income of $20.2 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Segment operating margins were 19.5 percent in 2012, as compared to 19.8 percent in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $2.0 million and segment operating income of $726,000, as compared to 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2012 revenues increased by $23.3 million, or 22.9 percent, and segment operating income increased by $4.5 million, or 22.2 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	In addition to increased revenues, as discussed below, operating results also reflect higher selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs related to additional resources to support the Company s growth strategy of Refresh-Build-Buy.
884219_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenues by line of business, as well as key performance indicators:
884219_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Excludes rooms closed for renovation at Many Glacier Hotel during 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Calculated as revenues from room sales divided by the number of room nights available during the period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Amounts shown represent simple average of RevPAR for all Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties.
884219_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Calculated as total attractions revenues divided by the number of passengers during the period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Amounts shown represent simple average of revenue per passenger at all Travel Recreation Group attractions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenue growth from hospitality properties benefitted from the initial peak season contributions from the recently acquired Alaska Denali Travel business (acquired on September 16, 2011) and the Banff International Hotel (acquired on March 7, 2012), with approximately $11.9 million of incremental revenues.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	St. Mary Lodge Resort and Grouse Mountain Lodge, both in their second year as part of the Travel Recreation Group and renovated as part of the Company s Refresh-Build-Buy strategy, also increased revenue over 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Additionally, rooms that were under renovation at the Many Glacier Hotel in 2011 provided a full revenue contribution in 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	Revenues were also favorably impacted by increased passenger volumes at Travel Recreation Group s attractions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	As compared to 2011, passenger volumes increased by 9.9 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	During 2012, approximately 65 percent of revenues and 77 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenues and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S7	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S8	Management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2012 will not have a meaningful effect on Travel Recreation Group 2013 full year revenues and segment operating income.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S9	Management also anticipates the four acquisitions completed by Viad since the beginning of 2011 will generate approximately $25 million in revenues in 2013 with an average Adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) of more than 30 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P25_S10	By leveraging economies of scale and scope and repositioning the acquired assets for higher returns, management expects to grow this revenue base at a mid single-digit compound annual growth rate from 2013 to 2015, with expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins over that time period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Glacier Park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park.
884219_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Glacier Park s original 25-year concession contract with the Park Service that was to expire on December 31, 2005 has been extended for eight one-year periods and now expires on December 31, 2013.
884219_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Glacier Park generated approximately 49 percent of its 2012 revenues through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	On December 14, 2012, the Park Service issued a prospectus soliciting proposals from prospective bidders, including Glacier Park, for the award of a 16-year concession contract beginning on January 1, 2014.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Glacier Park is currently preparing its bid for the contract, which is due on or before April 16, 2013.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	Although Viad believes that Glacier Park is well-positioned to win the new contract, if the Park Service selects a new concessionaire, Glacier Park would be entitled to $25 million for its possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract, plus an estimated $5 million for the personal property Glacier Park uses at the facilities covered by the concession contract.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	If a new concessionaire is selected by the Park Service, Glacier Park would continue to generate revenue from the four properties it owns outside of Glacier National Park: Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana; St. Mary Lodge Resort in St. Mary, Montana and the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, which Glacier Park owns and operates under a 42-year ground lease with the Canadian government running through January 31, 2052.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	Glacier Park generated 24 percent of the Travel Recreation Group s 2012 segment operating income.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Corporate activities expense of $9.4 million in 2012 increased from $7.7 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P27_S6	This increase was primarily due to costs related to the amendment and restatement of the Company s shareholder rights plan as well as increased performance-based compensation expense.
884219_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	In 2012, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $4.9 million, as compared to $3.8 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	These charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of facility consolidations as well as the elimination of certain positions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The effective tax rate for 2012 was 77.8 percent, as compared to 29.5 percent for 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The high rate for 2012, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to the charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million representing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	2011 vs. 2010: Revenues for 2011 increased 11.6 percent to $942.4 million, as compared to $844.8 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $13.2 million for 2011, as compared to $2.6 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	These increases were primarily due to higher revenues from the Marketing Events Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net restructuring charges in 2011 were $3.8 million, as compared to $4.2 million in 2010, both primarily related to the Marketing Events Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	Impairment losses for 2010 were $268,000 (after-tax), or $0.01 per diluted share.
884219_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	The Company did not record any impairment losses in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net income attributable to Viad for 2011 was $9.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, as compared to $443,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	These results include income from discontinued operations of $451,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2011 and $262,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2010 relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	During 2011, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in increases in revenues and segment operating income of $14.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations: Accordingly, Viad s results were impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $631.4 million for 2011, up 10.6 percent, as compared to $571.0 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The increase was primarily due to base same-show revenue increases of 11.2 percent, increased exhibitor spending, new business wins and positive show rotation of approximately $11 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Base same-shows represented 36.6 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The 2011 segment operating loss was $6.3 million, as compared to a loss of $15.2 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	The improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues, partially offset by higher accruals for performance-based incentives.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $218.6 million for 2011, up 10.5 percent, as compared to $197.8 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	Segment operating income was $11.4 million in 2011, as compared to $10.1 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S6	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rates during 2011, resulting in increases of $9.8 million in revenue and $379,000 in segment operating income, as compared to 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S7	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 revenues increased by $11.1 million, or 5.6 percent, and operating income increased by $982,000, or 9.7 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S8	The increase in revenues was primarily due to new show wins, positive show rotation of approximately $4 million and same-show growth, which more than offset 2010 first quarter revenues from a major project for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Canada.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S9	Operating results for 2011 reflect higher compensation expenses, including merit increases and the elimination of temporary wage reductions, as compared to 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S10	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $101.8 million, up 15.3 percent, as compared to 2010 revenues of $88.3 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S11	Segment operating income was $20.2 million, up 1.6 percent from 2010 segment operating income of $19.9 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S12	Segment operating margins were 19.8 percent in 2011, as compared to 22.5 percent in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P34_S13	As discussed above, results in this segment were impacted by exchange rate variances during 2011, resulting in increases of $4.3 million and $1.3 million in revenues and segment operating income, respectively, as compared to 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenues by line of business, as well as key performance indicators:
884219_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Excludes rooms closed for renovation at Many Glacier Hotel during 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Calculated as revenues from room sales divided by the number of room nights available during the period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Amounts shown represent simple average of RevPAR for all Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties.
884219_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Calculated as total attractions revenues divided by the number of passengers during the period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Amounts shown represent simple average of revenue per passenger at all Travel Recreation Group attractions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 revenues increased by $9.2 million, or 10.5 percent, primarily due to the acquisitions of Grouse Mountain Lodge and St. Mary Lodge Resort, which are located near Glacier National Park, as well as organic revenue growth at Brewster.
884219_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	The Company acquired Grouse Mountain Lodge on January 5, 2011 for $10.5 million in cash and the 115-room St. Mary Lodge Resort on June 29, 2011 for $15.3 million in cash.
884219_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Brewster realized growth across all of its lines of business with the exception of its transportation business, which had higher 2010 revenues resulting from charter contracts related to the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.
884219_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	These improvements were partially offset by lower revenues from Many Glacier Hotel, a property operated by Glacier Park, resulting from planned construction that reduced the number of rooms available during 2011, as compared to 2010, as well as lower visitation to Glacier National Park during July and August.
884219_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2011 segment operating income decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to the lower revenues at Many Glacier Hotel (which have a high flow through to operating income) and the seasonal fourth quarter operating loss at Alaska Denali Travel.
884219_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company acquired the 42-room Denali Backcountry Lodge and 46 Denali Cabins on September 16, 2011 for $15.3 million in cash.
884219_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	During 2011, approximately 70 percent of revenue and 86 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Glacier Park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service for Glacier National Park as previously noted.
884219_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Glacier Park generated approximately 45 percent of its 2011 revenues through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Glacier Park generated 19 percent of the Travel Recreation Group s 2011 segment operating income.
884219_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Corporate activities expense of $7.7 million in 2011 increased from $6.4 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	This increase was primarily due to higher legal fees related to employee benefits associated with previously divested operations and other matters.
884219_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2011, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $3.8 million, as compared to $4.2 million in 2010 (the 2010 amount includes a reversal of restructuring reserves of $814,000 primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities).
884219_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	These charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of the elimination of certain positions as well as facility consolidations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The effective tax rate for 2011 was 29.5 percent, as compared to 68.1 percent for 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The relatively low rate for 2011, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to favorable tax resolutions of $103,000, state tax benefits of $100,000 and other tax benefits.
884219_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The relatively high rate for 2010, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to the write-off of deferred taxes of $1.3 million as a result of health care legislation, partially offset by favorable tax resolutions of $514,000.
884219_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	Excluding the effects of these items, the 2010 effective rate was 38.2 percent.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources: Cash and cash equivalents were $114.2 million as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $100.4 million as of December 31, 2011, with the increase primarily due to cash flow from operations, partially offset by the acquisition of the Banff International Hotel and capital expenditures.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	During 2012, the Company generated net cash flows from operating activities of $69.2 million primarily driven by operating results.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Management believes that Viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $46.8 million of its cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	Of the total amount, $37.3 million was held in Canada, $6.4 million in the United Kingdom, $1.8 million in Germany and $1.3 million in the United Arab Emirates.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	There were certain historical earnings related to its Canadian operations which, if repatriated to the United States, would result in incremental income tax expense.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	The incremental tax liability as of December 31, 2012 that would result assuming all foreign cash balances were repatriated to the United States would be approximately $1.1 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S7	A summary of cash flow information is provided below: Operating Activities Cash flows from operations in 2012 totaled $69.2 million, as compared to $34.7 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S8	This increase was primarily due to favorable working capital changes.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S9	Cash flows from operations in 2011 totaled $34.7 million, as compared to $43.3 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S10	This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S11	Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2012 totaled $49.5 million, as compared to $62.2 million in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S12	This decrease was primarily due to less cash used for acquisitions during 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S13	Cash used in investing activities in 2011 totaled $62.2 million, as compared to $2.3 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S14	This increase was primarily due to $41.1 million used for acquisitions during 2011 and $14.8 million in proceeds from dispositions of property and other assets in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S15	Capital expenditures for 2012 totaled $27.7 million and primarily related to the purchase of rental inventory, equipment and computer hardware and leasehold improvements at the Marketing Events U.S. segment as well as Glacier Skywalk construction costs and building and other improvements at the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P45_S16	Capital expenditures for 2011 totaled $21.5 million and primarily related to the purchase of rental inventory, equipment and computer hardware primarily at the Marketing Events U.S. segment as well as building and other improvements at the Travel Recreation Group.

884219_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	During 2012, the Company began construction on the Glacier Skywalk, a 1,312-foot guided interpretive walkway with a 98-foot glass-floored observation area overlooking the Sunwapta Valley at the Tangle Ridge Viewpoint in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada.
884219_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	In 2012, the Travel Recreation Group incurred $8.9 million in capital expenditures relating to the Glacier Skywalk, with an accrued capital expenditure amount of $2.6 million as of December 31, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	In 2013, management anticipates spending approximately $12 million to $14 million (including the $2.6 million accrued as of December 31, 2012) to complete the project for which funding will be provided by cash from operations.

884219_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	This decrease was primarily due to higher debt repayments, debt issuance costs and common stock repurchases in 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Cash used in financing activities in 2011 was $16.5 million as compared to $14.5 million in 2010, with the increase primarily driven by higher debt repayments.
884219_13_ITEM7_P49_S4	Viad s total debt as of December 31, 2012 was $2.2 million, as compared to $3.2 million as of December 31, 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P49_S5	The debt-to-capital ratio was 0.006 to 1 as of December 31, 2012, as compared with 0.008 to 1 as of December 31, 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Capital is defined as total debt and capital lease obligations plus total stockholders equity.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	In May 2011, Viad amended and restated its secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility ).
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Credit Facility provides for a $130 million revolving line of credit, which may be increased up to an additional $50 million under certain circumstances.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The term of the Credit Facility is five years (expiring on May 18, 2016) and borrowings are to be used for general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions) and to support up to $50 million of letters of credit.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The lenders have a first perfected security interest in all of the personal property of Viad and GES, including 65 percent of the capital stock of top-tier foreign subsidiaries.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	In April 2011, Viad paid off its outstanding borrowing under the previous credit facility of $4.2 million and as of December 31, 2012, Viad s total debt of $2.2 million consisted entirely of capital lease obligations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had $128.2 million of capacity remaining under its Credit Facility reflecting outstanding letters of credit of $1.8 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S6	Borrowings under the Credit Facility (of which GES is a guarantor) are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus appropriate spreads tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S7	Commitment fees and letters of credit fees are also tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S8	The fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility are currently 0.35 percent annually.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S9	As part of the amendment and restatement, Viad s financial covenants were revised to include a fixed-charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.25 to 1 (and a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1 after the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012) and a leverage ratio (defined as total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 2.50 to 1.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S10	Additionally, Viad must maintain a consolidated minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of $50 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P51_S11	As of December 31, 2012, the fixed-charge coverage and leverage ratios were 3.93 to 1 and 0.16 to 1, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The terms of the Credit Facility allow Viad to pay up to $10 million in dividends in the aggregate in any calendar year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Effective December 12, 2012, the Credit Facility was amended to remove the limitation on share repurchases of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year pursuant to certain conditions.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	The amendment allows share repurchases unless the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Facility, exists.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	The amendment also allows dividends to be declared and paid in excess of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year, as well as distributions on its capital stock, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Facility, exists.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	Significant other covenants include limitations on: investments, additional indebtedness, sales/leases of assets, acquisitions, consolidations or mergers and liens on property.
884219_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	As of December 31, 2012, Viad was in compliance with all covenants.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by the Company s subsidiary operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2012 would be $21.2 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities and expire through October 2017.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_13_ITEM7_P53_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	In December 2012, the Company announced its intent to repurchase up to an additional one million shares of its common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices.
884219_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	During 2012 and 2011, Viad repurchased 23,183 shares and 250,760 shares for $526,000 and $4.6 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2012, 1,030,438 shares remain available for repurchase from the announced authorization.

884219_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	The following table presents Viad s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012:
884219_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	(1) Estimated contributions related to multi-employer benefit plans are excluded from the table above.
884219_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding those obligations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	(2) Purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
884219_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	(3) Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $29.8 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2012 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
884219_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	As of December 31, 2012, there was a remaining environmental remediation liability of $5.3 million related to previously sold operations of which $571,000 is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Other current liabilities and $4.7 million under the caption Other deferred items and liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $20.7 million, $19.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Viad does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
884219_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	See Notes 10, 17 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	The SEC has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including: the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S5	For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events U.S. segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level, which represents all domestic operations of GES.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S6	Furthermore, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events International segment is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S7	For the Marketing Events International segment the reporting units are United Kingdom (Melville GES) and Canada.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S8	Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaska Denali Travel are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S9	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had total goodwill of $137.8 million consisting of $85.7 million related to the Marketing Events Group and $52.1 million related to the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM7_P64_S10	The following table summarizes goodwill balances by reporting unit and segment as of December 31:
884219_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Furthermore, the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had aggregate goodwill of $137.8 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Furthermore, as a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed in October 2012, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test was 126 percent, 67 percent and 34 percent for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom (Melville GES) and Canada, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	For the Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaska Denali Travel reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 58 percent, 37 percent and 14 percent, respectively, as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenues, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment losses.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $77.2 million and $70.7 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S8	The Company also evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits, given its recent utilization history.
884219_13_ITEM7_P68_S9	These tax credits are subject to a 10-year carryforward period and begin to expire in 2019.
884219_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Based on the Company s assessment, it was determined during the fourth quarter of 2012 that the weight of the evidence indicated that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards no longer met the more-likely-than-not test regarding the realization of those assets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance related to all of its foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2012, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	During 2012, the Company increased its valuation allowance related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards by $805,000.
884219_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million and $356,000, respectively, related to those state and foreign deferred tax assets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P69_S4	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	If such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Insurance liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability and property loss claims.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to the Company s retention limit) related to Viad s continuing operations was $21.1 million as of December 31, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Of this total, $13.3 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $7.8 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling $5.7 million as of December 31, 2012, primarily related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $200,000 to $500,000 on a per claim basis.
884219_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $5.6 million, $7.6 million and $6.8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, Viad has recorded insurance liabilities of $3.0 million related to continuing operations in excess of the self-insured levels for which Viad remains the primary obligor.
884219_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Of this total, $1.8 million related to worker s compensation liabilities and the remaining $1.2 million related to general liability claims.
884219_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The Company has presented these amounts as other deferred items and liabilities with a corresponding receivable in other investments and assets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.7 million to its funded pension plans and $1.1 million to its unfunded pension plans in 2013.
884219_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $400,000 to the plans in 2013.
884219_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2012 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5 percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2011 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by approximately $1.8 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $120,000.
884219_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $97,000.
884219_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows: The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $7.2 million, $4.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Furthermore, the total tax benefits related to such costs were $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2012, 2011 or 2010.
884219_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price until the time of settlement.
884219_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility; the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding; the expected dividend yield on Viad s common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	While the Company has not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s future results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Viad s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Forward-Looking Statements: As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new or renewal business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Among other things, natural disasters, gains and losses of customers, consumer demand patterns, labor relations, purchasing decisions related to customer demand for exhibition and event services, existing and new competition, industry alliances, consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which Viad competes, acquisitions, capital allocations, adverse developments in liabilities associated with discontinued operations and any deterioration in the economy and other risks discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, included in this Annual Report, may individually or in combination impact future results.
884219_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere, economic, competitive, governmental, technological, capital marketplace and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
884219_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.
884219_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	Interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of Viad.
884219_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P86_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of $42.2 million and $34.6 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	During 2012 and 2011, an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $7.5 million and a loss of $4.3 million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses, gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period-to-period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_13_ITEM7_P87_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange rate variances on segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations: As the Canadian operations generated aggregate operating income in 2012, Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $707,000 from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $1.9 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	As the United Kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in 2012, Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $72,000 from the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $1.0 million.
884219_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	As the German operations generated aggregate operating income in 2012, Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $107,000 from the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Euro would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $62,000.
884219_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices.
884219_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Periodically, Brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume, by fuel product, to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract, which is generally no longer than one year.
884219_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The main objective of Viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins.
884219_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	There were no fuel contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
884219_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	Refer to Index to Financial Statements for required information.
884219_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures has been evaluated as of December 31, 2012, and, based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2012.

884219_13_ITEM10_P8_S0	Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of Viad Corp and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
884219_13_ITEM10_P9_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_13_ITEM10_P9_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_13_ITEM10_P10_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_13_ITEM10_P10_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_13_ITEM10_P10_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_13_ITEM10_P11_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P11_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_13_ITEM10_P12_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_13_ITEM10_P12_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_13_ITEM10_P12_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_13_ITEM10_P13_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM10_P13_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
884219_13_ITEM10_P13_S2	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_13_ITEM10_P13_S3	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this Annual Report.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_13_ITEM10_P14_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_13_ITEM10_P15_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, of the Company and our report dated March 11, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_13_ITEM10_P29_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates.
884219_13_ITEM10_P30_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
884219_13_ITEM10_P30_S1	These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:
884219_13_ITEM10_P31_S0	Allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_13_ITEM10_P31_S1	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_13_ITEM10_P32_S0	Viad considers all highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
884219_13_ITEM10_P33_S0	Viad s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank demand deposits, bank time deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_13_ITEM10_P33_S1	The Company s investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_13_ITEM10_P34_S0	Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or market.
884219_13_ITEM10_P35_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_13_ITEM10_P35_S1	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_13_ITEM10_P35_S2	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_13_ITEM10_P36_S0	Viad capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software.
884219_13_ITEM10_P36_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_13_ITEM10_P36_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_13_ITEM10_P36_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_13_ITEM10_P36_S4	These costs are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_13_ITEM10_P37_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_13_ITEM10_P37_S1	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_13_ITEM10_P37_S2	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_13_ITEM10_P37_S3	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_13_ITEM10_P37_S4	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_13_ITEM10_P38_S0	Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance.
884219_13_ITEM10_P39_S0	Viad has Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_13_ITEM10_P39_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_13_ITEM10_P39_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash the Company could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_13_ITEM10_P39_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in the consolidated statements of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P40_S0	Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims.
884219_13_ITEM10_P40_S1	Viad has also retained certain liabilities related to workers compensation and general liability insurance claims in conjunction with previously sold operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P40_S2	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s prior historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_13_ITEM10_P41_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels.
884219_13_ITEM10_P42_S0	Viad has retained certain liabilities representing the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations primarily associated with previously sold operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P42_S1	The amounts accrued primarily consist of the estimated direct incremental costs, on an undiscounted basis, for contractor and other services related to remedial actions and post-remediation site monitoring.
884219_13_ITEM10_P43_S0	Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when the specific obligation is considered probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
884219_13_ITEM10_P43_S1	Subsequent recoveries from third parties, if any, are recorded through discontinued operations when realized.
884219_13_ITEM10_P44_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_13_ITEM10_P44_S1	The estimated fair value of debt obligations is disclosed in Note 9.
884219_13_ITEM10_P45_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_13_ITEM10_P45_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_13_ITEM10_P45_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_13_ITEM10_P45_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P45_S4	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_13_ITEM10_P46_S0	Viad recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
884219_13_ITEM10_P47_S0	GES derives revenues primarily by providing show services to exhibitors participating in exhibitions and events and from the design, construction and refurbishment of exhibit booths and holiday themed environments.
884219_13_ITEM10_P47_S1	Service revenue is recognized at the time services are performed.
884219_13_ITEM10_P47_S2	Exhibits and environments revenue is accounted for using the completed-contract method as contracts are typically completed within three months of contract signing.
884219_13_ITEM10_P48_S0	The Travel Recreation Group generates revenues through its attractions, hotels and transportation and sightseeing services.
884219_13_ITEM10_P48_S1	Revenues are recognized at the time services are performed.
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S0	Viad recognizes and measures compensation costs related to all share-based payment awards using the fair value method of accounting.
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S1	These awards generally include restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock ( PBRS ), stock options and liability-based awards (including performance units, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units).
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S2	The fair value of restricted stock and PBRS awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S3	Viad issues restricted stock and PBRS awards from shares held in treasury.
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S4	Future vesting of restricted stock and PBRS is generally subject to continued employment with Viad or its subsidiaries.
884219_13_ITEM10_P49_S5	Holders of restricted stock and PBRS have the right to receive dividends and vote the shares, but may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber the stock, except to the extent restrictions have lapsed.
884219_13_ITEM10_P50_S0	Restricted stock awards vest between three and five years from the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P50_S1	Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately three years except for certain awards with a five-year vesting period whereby expense is recognized based on an accelerated multiple-award approach over a five-year period.
884219_13_ITEM10_P50_S2	For these awards, 40 percent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant and the remaining shares vest in 30 percent increments over the subsequent two anniversary dates.
884219_13_ITEM10_P50_S3	Share-based compensation expense related to PBRS awards is recognized based on an accelerated multiple-award approach over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_13_ITEM10_P51_S0	PBRS vests when certain incentive performance targets established in the year of grant are achieved at target levels.
884219_13_ITEM10_P51_S1	PBRS is subject to a graded vesting schedule whereby one third of the earned shares vest after the first year and the remaining earned shares vest in one-third increments each year over the next two years on the first business day in January.
884219_13_ITEM10_P52_S0	The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
884219_13_ITEM10_P52_S1	Share-based compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately five years.
884219_13_ITEM10_P53_S0	The exercise price of stock options is based on the market value of Viad s common stock at the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P53_S1	Stock options granted also contain certain forfeiture and non-compete provisions.
884219_13_ITEM10_P53_S2	Liability-based awards (including grants of restricted stock units and PBRS units awarded to key employees at certain of the Company s Canadian operations) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price until the time of settlement.
884219_13_ITEM10_P53_S3	To the extent earned, liability-based awards are settled in cash based on Viad s stock price.
884219_13_ITEM10_P53_S4	Compensation expense related to liability-based awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_13_ITEM10_P54_S0	Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at historical cost.
884219_13_ITEM10_P54_S1	Subsequent share reissuances are primarily related to share-based compensation programs and recorded at weighted-average cost.
884219_13_ITEM10_P55_S0	Viad applies the two-class method in calculating income per common share as unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P55_S1	Accordingly, such securities are included in the earnings allocation in calculating income per share.
884219_13_ITEM10_P55_S2	Furthermore, Viad funds its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) feature of the Company s 401(k) defined contribution plan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P55_S3	ESOP shares are treated as outstanding for income per share calculations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P56_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing, which is codified in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350.
884219_13_ITEM10_P56_S1	The new guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
884219_13_ITEM10_P56_S2	If, after performing the assessment, an entity determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
884219_13_ITEM10_P56_S3	The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
884219_13_ITEM10_P56_S4	The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P57_S0	The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31 of each year.
884219_13_ITEM10_P58_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income, which is codified in ASC Topic 220.
884219_13_ITEM10_P58_S1	The new guidance requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
884219_13_ITEM10_P58_S2	In addition, entities are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income in certain circumstances, or otherwise cross-reference amounts to other disclosures.
884219_13_ITEM10_P58_S3	The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, and will not have an impact on Viad s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P59_S0	Share-Based Compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan ).
884219_13_ITEM10_P59_S1	The 2007 Plan has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_13_ITEM10_P59_S2	The number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2007 Plan is limited to 1,700,000 shares plus shares awarded under the 1997 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (which terminated in May 2007) that subsequently cease for any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent the shares are exercised for, or settled in, vested and non-forfeited shares) up to an aggregate maximum of 1,500,000 shares.
884219_13_ITEM10_P59_S3	As of December 31, 2012, there were 1,071,632 total shares available for future grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P59_S4	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense:

884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S0	In addition to the above, Viad had stock options outstanding which were granted to employees of MoneyGram International, Inc. prior to the spin-off of that company.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2012, there were 2,267 of such options outstanding and exercisable, both with an exercise price of $19.57.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S2	The weighted-average remaining contractual life of these options outstanding was less than one year.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S3	During 2012, 135 options were exercised by employees of MoneyGram International, Inc. at an exercise price of $19.57.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S4	Stock options granted in 2010 were for a term of 10 years and became exercisable one third after one year, another third after two years and the balance after three years from the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S5	Stock options granted between 2004 and 2008 were for contractual terms of seven years and become exercisable, based on a graded vesting schedule, in annual increments of 20 percent beginning one year after the grant date and become fully exercisable after five years from the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S6	Stock options granted in 2003 were for a term of 10 years and became exercisable one third after one year, another third after two years and the balance after three years from the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S7	Stock options granted in calendar years 2002 and prior were for a contractual term of 10 years and became exercisable 50 percent after one year from the date of grant with the balance exercisable after two years from the date of grant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S8	The fair value of the 2010 stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming Viad s expected stock price volatility of 33.2 percent, a five year expected period of time the stock options will remain outstanding, an expected dividend yield on Viad common stock of 0.8 percent and a risk-free interest rate estimate of 2.44 percent.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S9	The expected dividend yield was based on Viad s expectation of future dividend payouts.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S10	The volatility assumption was based on Viad s daily historical stock price volatility during the time period that corresponds to the expected weighted-average life of the option.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S11	The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of stock options granted was estimated based on historical exercise activity.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S12	The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the interest rate of a U.S. Treasury strip for a five-year term from the date the option was granted.
884219_13_ITEM10_P65_S13	Additional information pertaining to stock options is provided in the table below:
884219_13_ITEM10_P66_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding in the table above represents the difference between Viad s closing stock price on December 31 of each year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options.
884219_13_ITEM10_P66_S1	The intrinsic value of stock options outstanding therefore changes based on changes in the fair market value of Viad s common stock.

884219_13_ITEM10_P101_S0	The fair value of an asset or liability is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
884219_13_ITEM10_P101_S1	The fair value guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P102_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P103_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
884219_13_ITEM10_P104_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value.
884219_13_ITEM10_P104_S1	Viad measures its money market mutual funds and certain other mutual fund investments at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.
884219_13_ITEM10_P104_S2	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following tables:

884219_13_ITEM10_P105_S6	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_13_ITEM10_P106_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of diluted and basic per share computations for net income attributable to Viad:
884219_13_ITEM10_P107_S0	(1) Diluted income per share amount cannot exceed basic income per share.
884219_13_ITEM10_P107_S1	Options to purchase 110,000, 304,000 and 474,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, but were not included in the computation of dilutive shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
884219_13_ITEM10_P107_S2	Additionally, 304,000, 336,000 and 322,000 share-based compensation awards were considered dilutive and included in the computation of diluted income per share in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P108_S0	Plan Viad funds its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s ESOP portion of the Viad Corp Capital Accumulation Plan (the 401(k) Plan ).
884219_13_ITEM10_P108_S1	All eligible employees of Viad and its participating affiliates, other than certain employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements that do not expressly provide for participation of such employees in an employee stock ownership plan, may participate in the employee stock ownership feature within the 401(k) Plan.

884219_13_ITEM10_P109_S1	In 2004, Viad borrowed $12.4 million under its revolving credit agreement to pay in full the outstanding ESOP loan and obtain release of Viad from its guarantee of the loan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P109_S2	In connection with the loan payoff, the ESOP entered into a $12.4 million loan with Viad maturing in June 2009 calling for minimum quarterly principal payments of $250,000 plus interest.
884219_13_ITEM10_P109_S3	The same amount, representing unearned employee benefits, was recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity.
884219_13_ITEM10_P110_S0	In 2007, the loan agreement between the ESOP and Viad was extended to December 31, 2016.
884219_13_ITEM10_P110_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the balance of the ESOP loan was $1.3 million and is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Unearned employee benefits and other.
884219_13_ITEM10_P110_S2	The liability is reduced as the ESOP makes principal payments on the borrowing, and the amount offsetting stockholders equity is reduced as stock is allocated to employees and benefits are charged to expense.
884219_13_ITEM10_P111_S0	The 401(k) Plan repays the loan using Viad contributions and dividends received on the unallocated Viad shares held by the 401(k) Plan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P111_S1	Information regarding ESOP transactions is as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P112_S0	Shares were released for allocation to participants based upon the ratio of the current year s principal and interest payments to the sum of the total principal and interest payments expected over the remaining life of the loan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P112_S1	Viad recorded expense of $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P112_S2	Unallocated shares held by the 401(k) Plan totaled 130,577 and 293,280 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P112_S3	Shares allocated during 2012 and 2011 totaled 162,703 and 147,089, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P113_S0	( Right ) outstanding on each outstanding share of common stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan (the Rights Agreement ) adopted by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2002, as adjusted in connection with Viad s one-for-four reverse stock split on July 1, 2004, and as amended on February 28, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM10_P113_S1	The Rights expired and the Rights Agreement terminated on February 28, 2013 on its own terms.
884219_13_ITEM10_P114_S0	Viad has authorized five million and two million shares of Preferred Stock and Junior Participating Preferred Stock, respectively, none of which is outstanding.
884219_13_ITEM10_P115_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of income tax expense and the amount that would be computed using the statutory federal income tax rates:
884219_13_ITEM10_P116_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a related measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, were both enacted into law.
884219_13_ITEM10_P116_S1	As a result of this legislation, the tax deductions for the portion of the prescription drug costs for which Viad receives a Medicare Part D subsidy have been eliminated for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM10_P116_S2	Accordingly, during 2010, Viad reduced its deferred tax asset related to its postretirement benefit plan liability to reflect the change in the tax law.
884219_13_ITEM10_P116_S3	The reduction in the deferred tax asset resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $1.3 million in 2010.
884219_13_ITEM10_P117_S0	Viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts or had previously conducted operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P117_S1	These include U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions, and certain foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S0	Viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad did not have any accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S2	As of December 31, 2010, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of $146,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S3	Viad classifies interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S4	During 2011, Viad recorded tax-related interest expense credits of $146,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S5	During 2011 and 2010, Viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of $103,000 and $514,000, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S6	These tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S7	In addition to the above, Viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $636,000 as of both December 31, 2012 and 2011.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $418,000 and $386,000, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S9	Future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations (net of federal tax effects, if applicable).
884219_13_ITEM10_P118_S10	Viad does not expect any of the unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized during the next 12 months.
884219_13_ITEM10_P119_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of the total amounts of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties):
884219_13_ITEM10_P120_S0	Viad s 2009 through 2012 U.S. federal tax years and various state tax years from 2008 through 2012 remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P120_S1	Additionally, 2005 through 2008 remain subject to examination due to net operating loss carryback claims.
884219_13_ITEM10_P120_S2	In addition, tax years from 2008 through 2012 related to Viad s foreign taxing jurisdictions also remain subject to examination.
884219_13_ITEM10_P121_S0	Viad classifies liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as non-current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets unless they are expected to be paid within the next year.
884219_13_ITEM10_P121_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (including interest and penalties) of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, were classified as non-current liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P121_S2	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 related to the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S0	Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S5	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $77.2 million and $70.7 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S8	The Company also evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits, given its recent utilization history.
884219_13_ITEM10_P122_S9	These tax credits are subject to a 10-year carryforward period and begin to expire in 2019.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S0	Based on the Company s assessment, it was determined during the fourth quarter of 2012 that the weight of the evidence indicated that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards no longer met the more-likely-than-not test regarding the realization of those assets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance related to all of its foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2012, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $82.0 million and $91.9 million, respectively, for which the Company had deferred tax assets of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S3	The state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates from 2016 through 2032.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S4	During 2012, the Company increased its valuation allowance related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards by $805,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S5	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million and $356,000, respectively, related to those state and foreign deferred tax assets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P123_S6	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S3	If such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S4	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had tax credit carryforwards related to alternative minimum tax of $11.4 million that may be carried forward indefinitely.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S5	Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, Viad had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $13.4 million, of which $268,000 expire in 2019, $8.3 million expire in 2020, $4.5 million expire in 2021 and $320,000 expire in 2022.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S6	As noted above, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $13.4 million related to the foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S7	Viad also had general business credits of $519,000 as of December 31, 2012, which expire at various dates from 2028 to 2032.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S8	Viad has not recorded deferred taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiaries as management intends to reinvest those earnings in its Canadian operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S9	As of December 31, 2012, the incremental unrecognized tax liability (net of estimated foreign tax credits) related to those undistributed earnings was approximately $711,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S10	To the extent that circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of those undistributed earnings will be remitted to the U.S., Viad would accrue income taxes attributable to such remittance.
884219_13_ITEM10_P124_S11	Income tax expense consisted of the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P125_S0	The aggregate tax benefit realized in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and PBRS and the exercise of stock options was $96,000 for 2012, which was recorded as a credit to stockholders equity.
884219_13_ITEM10_P125_S1	During 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded tax deficiencies of $325,000 and $524,000, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted stock and PBRS and the exercise of stock options, which were recorded as charges to stockholders equity.
884219_13_ITEM10_P125_S2	Eligible subsidiaries (including sold and discontinued businesses up to their respective disposition dates) are included in the consolidated federal and other applicable income tax returns of Viad.
884219_13_ITEM10_P125_S3	United States and foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes was as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P126_S0	Pension and Postretirement Benefits Domestic Plans.
884219_13_ITEM10_P127_S0	Viad has trusteed, frozen defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees which are funded by the Company.
884219_13_ITEM10_P127_S1	Viad also maintains certain unfunded defined benefit pension plans which provide supplemental benefits to select management employees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P127_S2	These plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_13_ITEM10_P128_S0	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P128_S1	Viad also has certain defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_13_ITEM10_P129_S0	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P129_S1	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_13_ITEM10_P129_S2	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad may fund the plans.
884219_13_ITEM10_P129_S3	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income of Viad s pension plans included the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P130_S0	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income of Viad s postretirement benefit plans included the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P131_S0	The following table indicates the funded status of the plans as of December 31:
884219_13_ITEM10_P132_S0	The net amounts recognized in Viad s consolidated balance sheets under the caption Pension and postretirement benefits as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P133_S0	Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2012 consisted of:
884219_13_ITEM10_P134_S0	Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2011 consisted of:
884219_13_ITEM10_P135_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the pension plans that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost in 2013 is approximately $597,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P135_S1	The estimated net actuarial loss for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 is approximately $566,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P135_S2	The estimated prior service credit for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit credit in 2013 is approximately $901,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P136_S0	The fair value of the domestic plans assets by asset class was as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P137_S0	The significant amount of investments held in cash in the domestic pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2012 was due to a change in the investment custodian during December 2012.
884219_13_ITEM10_P137_S1	All securities held by the previous custodian were liquidated to cash and transferred to the new custodian on December 26, 2012.
884219_13_ITEM10_P137_S2	During January and February 2013, the new custodian invested the plans assets in a mix of equities and fixed income securities approximating the same mixes as on December 31, 2011.
884219_13_ITEM10_P138_S0	Viad employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income securities is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
884219_13_ITEM10_P138_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
884219_13_ITEM10_P139_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P139_S1	Furthermore, equity securities are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth and value.
884219_13_ITEM10_P140_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements.
884219_13_ITEM10_P141_S0	Viad utilizes a building-block approach in determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P141_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
884219_13_ITEM10_P141_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
884219_13_ITEM10_P141_S3	The long-term portfolio return also considers diversification and rebalancing.
884219_13_ITEM10_P142_S0	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed relative to Viad s assumed rates for reasonableness and appropriateness.
884219_13_ITEM10_P143_S0	The following pension and postretirement benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid, as well as the Medicare Part D subsidy expected to be received:
884219_13_ITEM10_P144_S0	Certain of Viad s foreign operations also maintain trusteed defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees which are funded by the companies, and unfunded defined benefit pension plans providing supplemental benefits to select management employees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P144_S1	These plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_13_ITEM10_P145_S0	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P146_S0	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income included the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P147_S0	The following table represents the funded status of the plans as of December 31:
884219_13_ITEM10_P148_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the foreign funded plans had liabilities of $2.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P148_S1	The unfunded plans had liabilities of $3.0 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P148_S2	These amounts are each included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Pension and postretirement benefits.
884219_13_ITEM10_P148_S3	The net actuarial losses for the foreign funded plans as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $5.3 million ($3.9 million after-tax) and $4.6 million ($3.4 million after-tax), respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P148_S4	The net actuarial losses as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 for the foreign unfunded plans were $366,000 ($271,000 after-tax) and $269,000 ($199,000 after-tax), respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P149_S0	The fair value of the foreign pension plans assets by asset category were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P150_S0	The following payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
884219_13_ITEM10_P151_S0	Information for Pension Plans with an Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets.
884219_13_ITEM10_P151_S1	The accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P152_S0	In aggregate for both the domestic and foreign plans, the Company anticipates contributing $1.7 million to the funded pension plans, $1.1 million to the unfunded pension plans and $400,000 to the postretirement benefit plans in 2013.
884219_13_ITEM10_P153_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P154_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P155_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2012 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5 percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_13_ITEM10_P155_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2011 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_13_ITEM10_P155_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by approximately $1.8 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $120,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P155_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $97,000.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S0	Viad contributes to defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S1	The financial risks of participating in these multi-employer pension plans generally include the fact that assets contributed to the plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S2	Furthermore, if a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S3	In addition, if Viad were to discontinue its participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S4	Viad also contributes to defined contribution plans pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements, which are generally not subject to the funding risks inherent in defined benefit pension plans.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S5	The overall level of Viad s contributions to its multi-employer plans may significantly vary from year to year based on the demand for union-represented labor to support the Company s operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P156_S6	Viad does not have any minimum contribution requirements for future periods pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements for individually significant multi-employer plans.
884219_13_ITEM10_P157_S0	Viad s participation in multi-employer pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2012, is outlined in the following table.
884219_13_ITEM10_P157_S1	Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2012 and 2011 relates to the plan s year end as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is based on information received from the plan.
884219_13_ITEM10_P157_S2	Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded.
884219_13_ITEM10_P157_S3	The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan is either pending or has been implemented.
884219_13_ITEM10_P158_S0	Costs of the 401(k) Plan and other benefit plans totaled $1.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.6 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S0	Restructuring Charges Marketing Events Group Consolidation Beginning in 2009, Viad commenced certain restructuring actions designed to reduce the Company s cost structure primarily within the Marketing Events U.S. segment, and to a lesser extent in the Marketing Events International segment.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S1	The Company implemented a strategic reorganization plan in order to consolidate the separate business units within the Marketing Events U.S. segment.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S2	The Company also consolidated facilities and streamlined its operations in the United Kingdom and Germany.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S3	As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges in 2011 and 2010, primarily consisting of severance and related benefits as a result of workforce reductions and charges related to the consolidation and downsizing of facilities representing the remaining operating lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income) and related costs.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S4	During 2012, the Company recorded restructuring charges related to leased facility consolidations and optimization of the Marketing Events U.S. segment s service delivery network.
884219_13_ITEM10_P159_S5	The Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges during 2013 primarily related to facility consolidations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S0	Other Restructurings The Company has recorded restructuring charges in connection with the consolidation of certain support functions at its corporate headquarters, and certain reorganization activities within the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S1	These charges primarily consist of severance and related benefits due to headcount reductions.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S2	In addition, the Company had recorded significant restructuring charges in past years, primarily within the Marketing Events U.S. segment.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S3	These legacy restructuring liabilities represent the remaining contractual lease obligations on certain facilities, and are subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes in estimated sublease activity and other factors.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S4	These adjustments can result in reversals of previously recorded amounts, or additional charges in some cases.
884219_13_ITEM10_P160_S5	The table below represents a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability balances by major restructuring activity:
884219_13_ITEM10_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the liability of $720,000 related to severance and employee benefits in the Marketing Events Group consolidation is expected to be paid by the end of 2013.
884219_13_ITEM10_P161_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, the liability of $5.6 million and $933,000 related to facilities in the Marketing Events Group consolidation and other restructurings, respectively, relates to future lease payment obligations to be made over the remaining lease terms.
884219_13_ITEM10_P161_S2	See Note 19 for information regarding restructuring charges by segment.
884219_13_ITEM10_P162_S0	Leases and Other Viad has entered into operating leases for the use of certain of its offices, equipment and other facilities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P162_S1	These leases expire over periods up to 40 years.
884219_13_ITEM10_P162_S2	Leases which expire are generally renewed or replaced by similar leases.
884219_13_ITEM10_P162_S3	Some leases contain scheduled rental increases accounted for on a straight-line basis.
884219_13_ITEM10_P162_S4	As of December 31, 2012, Viad s future minimum rental payments and related sublease rentals receivable with respect to non-cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year were as follows:
884219_13_ITEM10_P163_S0	Net rent expense under operating leases consisted of the following:
884219_13_ITEM10_P164_S0	The aggregate annual maturities and the related amounts representing interest on capital lease obligations are included in Note 9.
884219_13_ITEM10_P164_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, the Company had aggregate purchase obligations of $32.8 million related to various licensing agreements, consulting and other contracted services.
884219_13_ITEM10_P165_S0	Litigation, Claims, Contingencies and Other Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_13_ITEM10_P165_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_13_ITEM10_P165_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2012 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P166_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P166_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_13_ITEM10_P166_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P166_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P166_S4	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, Viad had recorded environmental remediation liabilities of $5.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, related to previously sold operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by Viad s subsidiary operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2012 would be $21.2 million.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities expiring through October 2017.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P167_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and the Company is a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S1	As of December 31, 2012, approximately 34 percent of Viad s regular full-time employees are covered by collective-bargaining agreements.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S2	If the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S3	Viad believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2013 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse effect on Viad s operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S4	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S5	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $20.7 million, $19.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively.
884219_13_ITEM10_P168_S6	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_13_ITEM10_P169_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_13_ITEM10_P169_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_13_ITEM10_P169_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_13_ITEM10_P170_S0	Glacier Park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park.
884219_13_ITEM10_P170_S1	Glacier Park s original 25-year concession contract with the Park Service that was to expire on December 31, 2005 has been extended for eight one-year periods and now expires on December 31, 2013.
884219_13_ITEM10_P170_S2	Glacier Park generated approximately 49 percent of its 2012 revenues through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_13_ITEM10_P171_S0	On December 14, 2012, the Park Service issued a prospectus soliciting proposals from prospective bidders, including Glacier Park, for the award of a 16-year concession contract beginning on January 1, 2014.
884219_13_ITEM10_P171_S1	Glacier Park is currently preparing its bid for the contract, which is due on or before April 16, 2013.
884219_13_ITEM10_P171_S2	Although Viad believes that Glacier Park is well-positioned to win the new contract, if the Park Service selects a new concessionaire, Glacier Park would be entitled to $25 million for its possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract, plus an estimated $5 million for the personal property Glacier Park uses at the facilities covered by the concession contract.
884219_13_ITEM10_P171_S3	If a new concessionaire is selected by the Park Service, Glacier Park would continue to generate revenue from the four properties it owns outside of Glacier National Park: Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana; St. Mary Lodge Resort in St. Mary, Montana and the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, which Glacier Park owns and operates under a 42-year ground lease with the Canadian government running through January 31, 2052.
884219_13_ITEM10_P172_S0	Segment Information Viad measures profit and performance of its operations on the basis of segment operating income which excludes restructuring charges and recoveries and impairment charges and recoveries.
884219_13_ITEM10_P172_S1	Intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and intersegment transfers are not significant.
884219_13_ITEM10_P172_S2	Corporate activities include expenses not allocated to operations.
884219_13_ITEM10_P172_S3	Depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense are the only significant non-cash items for the reportable segments.
884219_13_ITEM10_P172_S4	No reportable segment has a client comprising more than 5.2 percent of that segment s revenues, and no client comprises more than 3.1 percent of Viad s revenues.

884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There can be no assurances that management s current strategic evaluation of opportunities to enhance shareholder value will result in a transaction.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Viad s Board of Directors authorized management to explore and evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a potential separation of its Travel Recreation and Marketing Events business groups.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The Company engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor to assist in this evaluation process.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	No decision has been made to separate the two business groups, and Viad cannot assure that it will identify and undertake a transaction that allows its shareholders to realize an increase in the value of Viad s stock or provide any guidance on the timing of any such action.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Viad also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to its shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond Viad s control, including, among other factors, the U.S. and global economic and market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in Viad s businesses and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Viad s future payment of special dividends should not be relied upon as a way to realize any future gains on an investment.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S7	The Board of Directors generally declares and pays regular dividends to Viad s shareholders on a quarterly basis and also paid special dividends in November 2013 and February 2014.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S8	The decision to declare a special dividend and the amount, timing and payment of any such dividend are at the sole discretion of the Board.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S9	Factors in any decision to declare a dividend would include the amount of funds legally available and an evaluation of the Company s financial condition, capital requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Accordingly, an investor should not rely on the future payment of special dividends as a way to realize gains on their investment.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Viad s businesses and operating results are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Viad s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by increases and decreases in the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Operating results for the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the operating results for the Marketing Events Group are adversely affected.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Similarly, many of the retail shopping mall and lifestyle center clients of the Marketing Events Group may reduce marketing expenditures when economic conditions deteriorate.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenues from the Travel Recreation Group businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Viad s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Viad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Viad has not hedged its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenue, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	During 2013 , $229.3 million of revenue and $9.1 million of segment operating income was derived through the International segment.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, $81.9 million of 2013 revenue and $19.1 million of 2013 segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group was derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	For this segment, Canadian operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and, therefore, revenue and segment operating income in the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Exhibition rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer).
884219_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than when they have historically been held.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins in a given period if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	As a consequence of these factors, the operating results for these businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees or others, to travel.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities could adversely impact revenue.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although no single client accounts for more than 7.0 percent of the revenue of any of Viad s reporting segments, the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments have a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The loss of any of these large clients could adversely affect Viad s results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, revenue of the Marketing Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing or other services.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	When the Marketing Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the show organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform these electrical and plumbing services, subject in each case to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, some of these facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of these services.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing Events Group has these relationships moves these services in-house, Viad s revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The business activities of the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take those customers to a competitor.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any acquisition can involve a number of risks, including: the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Marketing Events U.S. segment generally reports its highest revenue during the first quarter of each year, while the Marketing Events International segment generally reports its highest revenue during the second quarter of each year.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The Travel Recreation Group businesses are generally also seasonal, experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These quarters accounted for 86 percent of the segment s 2013 revenue.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could adversely affect the operating results of Viad s businesses.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	From time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays and cost overruns, failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals and the inability to successfully integrate into Viad s ongoing businesses, as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with Viad s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. and International segments rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities and customer facilities.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If they were unable to secure the services of these independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on these businesses and their results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on these businesses and operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Similarly, disruption of transportation services could adversely affect the ability of the Marketing Events Group to supply time-sensitive holiday-themed exhibits and experiences to retail shopping mall and lifestyle center customers and could cause the cancellation of the exhibits and experiences.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In either event, Viad s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Moreover, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could adversely affect the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans to which Viad contributes may have an adverse impact on operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Viad s contributions to these multi-employer plans in 2013 and 2012 totaled $20.3 million and $20.7 million, respectively.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Viad does not directly manage these multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to these plans.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have an adverse impact on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Competition in the exhibition and events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting operating results.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If Viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment, results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food and fresh meats.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Some of these businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, the subject of litigation.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by these businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	liabilities, results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions, and reserves or insurance become inadequate.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad s business.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Such catastrophic events could impact the Marketing Events Group s production facilities, preventing the Company from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and also could cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels and other public venues.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Such catastrophic events also could adversely impact the Travel Recreation Group businesses, which are heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The guests serviced by the Travel Recreation Group tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions during a given season, and catastrophic events could impede the guests ability to travel, interrupt the Company s business operations and/or cause damage to the Company s properties.
884219_14_ITEM1A_P28_S6	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, Viad could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition.
884219_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	In 2013, the Company continued taking steps to reduce the physical footprint and overhead associated with the Marketing Events Group s U.S. warehousing facilities through its Service Delivery Network initiative.
884219_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	These steps included the sale of a New Jersey facility and the underlying land after determining that the property no longer met the Company s operational needs.
884219_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The goal of the Service Delivery Network initiative is to improve the efficiency and performance of the Marketing Events Group s U.S. warehousing operations by lowering operating costs and invested capital.
884219_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Since 2008, the Company has reduced its U.S. facility footprint by approximately 1.2 million square feet, and has realized annualized cost savings of $7.7 million through the end of 2013.
884219_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. segment operates 15 offices and 27 multi-use facilities (manufacturing, sales and design, office and/or warehouse and truck marshaling yards).
884219_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 592,100 square feet.
884219_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	Two of the multi-use facilities are owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	The Marketing Events International segment operates five offices and 20 multi-use facilities, with two offices and nine multi-use facilities in Canada, seven multi-use facilities in the United Kingdom, one office and two multi-use facilities in Germany, one office and two multi-use facilities in the United Arab Emirates and one office in the Netherlands.
884219_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 133,600 square feet.
884219_14_ITEM2_P3_S2	One of the multi-use facilities is owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment operates four offices, nine retail stores, one bus terminal, four garages, an icefield tour facility, a gondola lift operation, a boat tour facility, 14 hotels/lodges (including ancillary foodservice and recreational facilities) and 46 guest cabins.
884219_14_ITEM2_P4_S1	All of the facilities are in the United States or Canada.
884219_14_ITEM2_P4_S2	The bus terminal, three garages and the boat tour facility are owned and one garage is leased.
884219_14_ITEM2_P4_S3	The icefield tour facility and gondola lift operation are operated through lease agreements with Parks Canada and all other properties are leased.
884219_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Travel Recreation Group owns nine hotels/lodges and 42 guest cabins.
884219_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	During 2013, the Travel Recreation Group also operated an additional five hotels/lodges and 12 retail stores pursuant to the Glacier Park concession contract.
884219_14_ITEM2_P5_S2	As shown in the table below, the nine hotels and lodges and the guest cabins owned and operated by the Travel Recreation Group in 2013 accounted for 952 of the 1,444 rooms managed by the Travel Recreation Group:
884219_14_ITEM2_P6_S0	Viad Corporate operates the Company s headquarters, which are leased and approximate 24,700 square feet, and are located at 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900 in Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565.
884219_14_ITEM2_P6_S1	Management believes that the Company s facilities in the aggregate are adequate and suitable for their purposes and that capacity is sufficient for current needs.
884219_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure for actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

884219_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Quarterly dividends were paid on Viad s common stock on the first business day of January, April, July and October.
884219_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	In addition on January 24, 2014 and October 25, 2013, Viad announced that its Board of Directors declared special cash dividends of $1.50 and $2.50 per share, respectively, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2014 and November 7, 2013, respectively.
884219_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	The terms of Viad s $130 million secured revolving credit facility, amended and restated as of May 18, 2011, (the Credit Facility ) restricted Viad from paying more than $10 million in dividends in the aggregate in any calendar year.

884219_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) operates in three reportable business segments: Marketing Events U.S., Marketing Events International and Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Marketing Events Group, comprised of Global Experience Specialists, Inc. and affiliates ( GES ), specializes in all aspects of the design, planning and production of face-to-face events, immersive environments and brand-based experiences for clients, including show organizers, corporate brand marketers and retail shopping centers.
884219_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	In addition, the Marketing Events Group provides a variety of immersive, entertaining attractions and brand-based experiences, sponsored events, mobile marketing and other branded entertainment and face-to-face marketing solutions for clients and venues, including shopping malls, movie studios, museums and leading consumer brands.
884219_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment consists of Brewster Inc. ( Brewster ), Glacier Park, Inc. ( Glacier Park ) and Alaskan Park Properties, Inc. ( Alaska Denali Travel ).
884219_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Brewster provides tourism products and experiential services in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and in other parts of Western Canada.
884219_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Brewster s operations include the Banff Gondola, Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, motorcoach services, charter and sightseeing services, tour boat operations, inbound package tour operations and hotel operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	During 2013, Glacier Park, an 80 percent owned subsidiary of Viad, operated five lodges, three motor inns and one four-season resort hotel and provided food and beverage operations, retail operations and tour and transportation services in and around Glacier National Park in Montana and Waterton Lake National Park in Alberta, Canada.
884219_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Glacier Park s concession portion of its business with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park expired on December 31, 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Thereafter, the ongoing operations of Glacier Park will include: Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana; St. Mary Lodge in St. Mary, Montana; Motel Lake McDonald, an in-holding within Glacier National Park and the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Alaska Denali Travel operates the Denali Backcountry Lodge and Denali Cabins.
884219_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	In addition to lodging, Alaska Denali Travel also provides food and beverage operations and package tour and transportation services in and around Denali National Park and Preserve.
884219_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	In December 2012, Viad announced that its Board of Directors authorized management to explore and evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a potential separation of its Travel Recreation and Marketing Events business groups.
884219_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Viad engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor to assist in this evaluation process.
884219_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Income from discontinued operations of $ 1.1 million primarily related to the sale of land associated with previously sold operations Marketing Events U.S.
884219_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	A goodwill impairment loss of $4.5 million was recorded at Glacier Park, of which $892,000 was allocated to the noncontrolling interest Non-GAAP Measure: The following discussion includes a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Adjusted EBITDA is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation, debt service costs, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA primarily as a performance measure and believes that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP measure is net income attributable to Viad.
884219_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Although Adjusted EBITDA is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business, the use of Adjusted EBITDA is limited because it does not consider material costs, expenses and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment charges or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Because Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the Company s performance.
884219_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 million from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher segment operating results at the Travel Recreation Group, as well as lower corporate costs and restructuring charges.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $14.9 million from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher segment operating results at all operating segments, partially offset by higher restructuring charges and corporate costs.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	See Results of Operations below for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Results of Operations: 2013 vs. 2012 : Revenues for 2013 decreased 5.1 percent to $972.8 million, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $29.1 million for 2013, as compared to $26.8 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	Impairment losses for 2013 totaled $5.4 million, primarily related to the non-cash write-down of goodwill at Glacier Park of $4.5 million and the write-off of certain assets within the Marketing Events Group of $952,000.
884219_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	Net restructuring charges in 2013 were $3.9 million, as compared to $4.9 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	comprised of the elimination of certain positions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	In addition, restructuring charges related to the elimination of certain positions in the Travel Recreation Group and at Viad Corporate were also recorded in 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The 2012 restructuring charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of facility consolidations, as well as the elimination of certain positions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase in operating results, despite revenue declines, was primarily driven by continued same-show growth and focus on margin improvement at the Marketing Events Group, as well as expanded revenues at all three operating units within the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	Net income attributable to Viad for 2013 was $21.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, as compared to $5.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	In 2012, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $13.4 million to income tax expense representing a valuation allowance established for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S6	These results also include income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2013 and $624,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2012, both primarily related to the sale of land associated with previously sold operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P11_S7	During 2013, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in decreases in revenues and segment operating income of $7.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as compared to 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations:
884219_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Viad s results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $628.9 million for 2013, down 7.1 percent, as compared to $676.8 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease was primarily due to negative show rotation of $54 million, partially offset by base same-show revenue increases of 3.1 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management defines base same-show revenues as revenues derived from shows that the Company produced out of the same city during the same quarter in each year.
884219_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Base same-shows represented 46 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The 2013 segment operating income was $11.0 million, as compared to $5.6 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	The improved operating results were primarily due to lower performance-based incentives, the third quarter gain on sale of a facility in New Jersey and ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies.
884219_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	The Company is continuing to execute against a number of margin improvement initiatives designed to more effectively manage labor costs (the Labor Management initiative) and to reduce the physical footprint and the overhead associated with the U.S. warehousing operation (the Service Delivery Network initiative).
884219_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The focus of the Labor Management initiative is on driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning that reduces the ratio of labor costs to revenues.
884219_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Driving this measure down continues to be a primary focus for management and the benefits are shown through a 70 basis point improvement in the variable labor-to-revenue ratio on a U.S. base same-show basis, as compared to 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Company is also working to develop new tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement and benchmarking.
884219_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Through the Service Delivery Network initiative, the Company has reduced its U.S. facility footprint by approximately 1.1 million square feet since 2008, with annualized cost savings of $7.7 million realized through the end of 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	In connection with the Service Delivery Network initiative, Viad finalized plans to relocate the Marketing Events Group s New Jersey operations as a result of the facility no longer meeting the operational needs of the Company.
884219_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Viad sold the facility and the land upon which it was situated for $12.7 million (net of selling costs) during the third quarter of 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management realized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2013, which is included in the U.S. segment operating results and is partially offset by facility relocation costs during the fourth quarter of 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $229.3 million for 2013, down 4.5 percent, as compared to $240.1 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Segment operating income was $9.1 million in 2013, as compared to $12.3 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $4.3 million and segment operating income of $240,000, as compared to 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2013 revenues decreased by $6.6 million, or 2.7 percent, and segment operating income decreased by $3.0 million, or 24.5 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	These decreases were primarily driven by services provided for the 2012 London Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, partially offset by positive show rotation revenues of approximately $6 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenues are affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Marketing Events U.S. base same-show revenues have increased on a full year basis for 2011, 2012 and 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	For the 2014 full year, management expects U.S. base same-show revenues to increase at a low-to mid-single digit rate and show rotation to have a net positive impact on full year revenue of approximately $55 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Additionally, management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2013 will not have a meaningful impact on the Marketing Events Group s 2014 full year revenues and segment operating income.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	Management remains focused on improving the profitability of the Marketing Events U.S. segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs.
884219_14_ITEM7_P20_S5	Additional restructuring charges may be incurred as further cost structure improvements are made.
884219_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Marketing Events Group is subject to multiple collective-bargaining agreements that affect labor costs, about one-third of which expire each year.
884219_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company entered into new showsite and warehouse agreements with the Chicago Teamsters Local 727, effective January 1, 2014, and those agreements contain provisions that allow the parties to re-open negotiation of the agreements on pension-related issues.
884219_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The Company has commenced discussions regarding those issues with all relevant parties and is working diligently to resolve those issues in a manner that will be reasonable and equitable to employees, customers, and shareholders.
884219_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	Although the Company s labor relations are currently stable, disruptions pending the outcome of the Local 727 negotiations could occur, as could with any collective bargaining agreement negotiation, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $127.9 million, up 3.8 percent, as compared to 2012 revenues of $123.2 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Segment operating income was $25.8 million, up 7.7 percent from 2012 segment operating income of $24.0 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Segment operating margins were 20.2 percent in 2013, as compared to 19.5 percent in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $2.8 million and segment operating income of $790,000, as compared to 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2013 revenues increased by $7.5 million, or 6.0 percent, and segment operating income increased by $2.6 million, or 11.0 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Results in 2013 were negatively impacted by extensive flooding that took place on June 20, 2013, in Alberta, Canada.
884219_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Major pieces of infrastructure in the province were affected and many roads became impassable, which temporarily restricted access to Brewster s hotel properties and attractions in the area.
884219_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The provincial authorities were able to restore road access to Banff for both commercial and private vehicles by June 26, 2013, ahead of the Canada Day holiday weekend.
884219_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Management started seeing more normalized occupancy and visitor traffic in August.
884219_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Management estimates that the flooding had an unfavorable impact on 2013 revenues of approximately $2 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Brewster recovered well from the flooding that occurred in late June and delivered solid growth for the full year across nearly all of its lines of business.
884219_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenues by line of business:
884219_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The revenue growth from hospitality properties was primarily due to improved results at most of the lodges and hotels.
884219_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Glacier Park saw strong results, particularly at the Grouse Mountain Lodge, which was recently updated and refreshed.
884219_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, the Banff International Hotel, which was acquired on March 7, 2012, benefited from a full first quarter contribution.
884219_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management uses the following key business metrics to evaluate the Travel Recreation Group hospitality business: RevPAR, average daily rate ( ADR ) and occupancy.
884219_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	These metrics are commonly used in the hospitality industry to measure performance.
884219_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue for comparable hospitality properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability.
884219_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to generate.
884219_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Increases in ADR at hospitality properties lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on margins than increases in occupancy.
884219_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs), as well as lead to increased ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).
884219_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management evaluates the performance of the Travel Recreation Group attractions business utilizing the number of passengers and total attraction revenue per passenger.
884219_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The number of passengers allows management to assess the volume of visitor activity at each attraction during the period.
884219_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Total attraction revenue per passenger is calculated as total attraction revenue divided by the total number of passengers at all Travel Recreation Group attractions during the period.
884219_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	Total attraction revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	Total attraction revenue per passenger measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business.
884219_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators.
884219_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all Travel Recreation Group properties that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	For Travel Recreation Group properties located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the positive or negative effects that result from translating.
884219_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The same-store key performance indicators for hospitality properties presented below for 2013 exclude the rooms at the Banff International Hotel (acquired in March 2012) that do not have comparable results for 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Room nights available decreased in 2013 due to changes in seasonal opening dates of certain Glacier Park properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management schedules opening dates to optimize profitability based on anticipated travel patterns, and forecasted occupancy levels and operating expenses.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The increase in RevPAR reflects improvement across most properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Grouse Mountain Lodge experienced particularly strong growth in both ADR and occupancy driven by the Company s refresh initiatives.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The number of passengers increased across all of the Travel Recreation Group s attractions, despite the flood impact.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	Revenue per passenger increase was mainly driven by increased ticket prices at the Banff Gondola attraction.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	During 2013, approximately 64 percent of revenues and 74 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenues and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S6	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S7	Management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2013 will have an unfavorable impact on the Travel Recreation Group s 2014 full year revenues of approximately $3 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S8	Also, management anticipates the four acquisitions completed by Viad since the beginning of 2011 will generate approximately $27 million in revenues in 2014 with an average Adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) of more than 30 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P38_S9	By leveraging economies of scale and scope and repositioning the acquired assets for higher returns, management expects to grow this revenue base by three percent in 2014, with continued revenue growth and expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins in future years.
884219_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Glacier Park operated the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the U.S. National Park Service (the Park Service ) for Glacier National Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	On December 31, 2013, the concession contract expired.
884219_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Upon completion of the contract term, the Company received cash payments in January 2014 totaling $25 million for the Company s possessory interest, which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed, fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at Glacier National Park during the term of the concession contract.
884219_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company anticipates a cash payment of approximately $5 million for the personal property Glacier Park used at the facilities covered by the concession contract.
884219_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Glacier Park generated approximately 47 percent of its 2013 revenues through its concession contract for services provided within Glacier National Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Glacier Park continues to generate revenue from the five properties it owns: (1) St. Mary Lodge in St. Mary, Montana; (2) Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; (3) Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana; (4) the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta; and (5) Motel Lake McDonald, which is located inside Glacier National Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Glacier Park also continues to operate the food and beverage services with respect to these properties and the retail shops located near Glacier National Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The five properties Glacier Park currently owns contain more than one-half of the rooms that Glacier Park operated in 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Based on the above, management revised its outlook for future revenues and earnings from Glacier Park and performed an impairment evaluation of goodwill at the Glacier Park reporting unit.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.5 million representing all of the goodwill at Glacier Park, of which $892,000 related to the noncontrolling interest.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a result of the concession contract expiration, partially offset by continued organic growth at the five remaining properties, management anticipates a full year revenue decline at Glacier Park of approximately $19 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	The majority of the revenue impact will occur during the third quarter of 2014, with an approximate $3 million decline expected during the second quarter.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	Management anticipates a reduction in Glacier Park s segment operating income of approximately $3.5 million to $4 million in 2014.
884219_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	Due to the seasonal nature of the concession operations, management anticipates Glacier Park s third quarter operating income to be about $6 million lower than 2013, as this is when the concession properties run at full capacity.
884219_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	second and fourth quarters of 2014, Glacier Park is expected to have favorable operating results, primarily as a result of reduced overhead expenses and lower costs related to the opening and closing of the seasonal properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The following table summarizes Viad s actual results in comparison to pro forma information for Viad assuming that Glacier Park did not operate the concession contract with the Park Service for Glacier National Park for the entirety of the periods presented:
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Corporate activities expense of $6.8 million in 2013 decreased from $9.4 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	This decrease was primarily due to lower performance-based compensation expense in 2013, as well as higher costs in 2012 related to the amendment and restatement of the Company s shareholder rights plan and higher legal costs related to employee benefits associated with previously divested operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	These decreases were partially offset by 2013 costs related to the Company s strategic review process.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Corporate activities expense in 2014 is expected to approximate $9.5 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The expected increase over 2013 is primarily related to two reasons.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	First, the Company has exhausted the Viad common stock held in the leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company s 401(k) defined contribution plan (see Note 12 ) which has been used to fund matching contributions to the Company s 401(k) plan.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	Without the benefit of these low cost shares on which to provide a matching contribution, beginning in 2014 Viad will fund 401(k) matching contributions from shares held in treasury which have a higher cost to the Company.
884219_14_ITEM7_P44_S7	The second reason for the increase is related to an increase in performance-based compensation expense.
884219_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	In 2013, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $3.9 million, as compared to $4.9 million in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The 2013 charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of the elimination of certain positions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition, restructuring charges related to the elimination of certain positions in the Travel Recreation Group and at Viad Corporate were also recorded in 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	As noted above, Viad recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to Glacier Park of $4.5 million in 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Of the total amount, $892,000 of the goodwill impairment charge was allocated to the noncontrolling interest at Glacier Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, in 2013, Viad recorded impairment charges of $952,000 related to the write-off of certain assets within the Marketing Events Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The effective tax rate for 2013 was 29.5 percent, as compared to 77.8 percent for 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The high rate for 2012, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to the charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million, representing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	2012 vs. 2011 : Revenues for 2012 increased 8.8 percent to $1.0 billion, as compared to $942.4 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes was $26.8 million for 2012, as compared to $13.2 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	These increases were primarily due to same-show growth, new business wins, positive show rotation revenue of approximately $16 million from non-annual shows that took place during 2012 and continued focus on operating efficiencies at Viad s Marketing Events Group, as well as the first peak season contributions from Alaska Denali Travel and the Banff International Hotel, the newly renovated rooms at the Many Glacier Hotel and organic growth at the Company s Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	Net restructuring charges in 2012 were $4.9 million, as compared to $3.8 million in 2011, both primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of facility consolidations, as well as the elimination of certain positions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net income attributable to Viad for 2012 was $5.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared to $9.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	These results include a charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million representing a valuation allowance established for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	These results also include income from discontinued operations of $624,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2012 primarily related to the sale of land associated with previously sold operations and $451,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in 2011 relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	During 2012, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in decreases in revenues and segment operating income of $6.6 million and $886,000, respectively, as compared to 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenues and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations:
884219_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Viad s results were impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenues for the Marketing Events U.S. segment were $676.8 million for 2012, up 7.2 percent, as compared to $631.4 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase was primarily due to base same-show revenue increases of 6.5 percent and positive show rotation of approximately $21 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Base same-shows represented 41.5 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenues in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	The 2012 segment operating income was $5.6 million, as compared to a loss of $6.3 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	The improved operating results were primarily due to an increase in revenues with a continued focus on margin improvements, as well as ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies and control discretionary expenses.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	Revenues for the Marketing Events International segment were $240.1 million for 2012, up 9.8 percent, as compared to $218.6 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S6	Segment operating income was $12.3 million in 2012, as compared to $11.4 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S7	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $4.6 million and segment operating income of $160,000, as compared to 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S8	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2012 revenues increased by $26.1 million, or 11.9 percent, and operating income increased by $1.0 million, or 9.0 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S9	These increases were primarily driven by services provided for the 2012 London Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, as well as increased demand and new show wins, partially offset by net negative show rotation revenues of approximately $5 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S10	Revenues for the Travel Recreation Group segment were $123.2 million, up 21.0 percent, as compared to 2011 revenues of $101.8 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S11	Segment operating income was $24.0 million, up 18.6 percent from 2011 segment operating income of $20.2 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P53_S12	Segment operating margins were 19.5 percent in 2012, as compared to 19.8 percent in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	As discussed above, period-to-period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of $2.0 million and segment operating income of $726,000, as compared to 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2012 revenues increased by $23.3 million, or 22.9 percent, and segment operating income increased by $4.5 million, or 22.2 percent.
884219_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	In addition to increased revenues, as discussed below, operating results also reflect higher selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs related to additional resources to support the Company s growth strategy of Refresh-Build-Buy.
884219_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenues by line of business:
884219_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Revenue growth from hospitality properties benefited from the initial peak season contributions from the Alaska Denali Travel business (acquired in September 2011) and the Banff International Hotel (acquired in March 2012), with approximately $11.9 million of incremental revenues.
884219_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Additionally, rooms that were under renovation at the Many Glacier Hotel in 2011 provided a full revenue contribution in 2012.
884219_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators.
884219_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The same-store key performance indicators for hospitality properties for 2012 exclude the rooms at the following properties that do not have comparable results for 2011:
884219_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Banff International Hotel (acquired March 2012), Denali Cabins (acquired September 2011), Denali Backcountry Lodge (acquired September 2011), St. Mary Lodge (acquired June 2011) and Many Glacier Hotel (rooms closed for renovation during 2011).
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	(1) Grouse Mountain Lodge, acquired on January 5, 2011, is included in the same-store key performance indicators above.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Room nights available saw a slight decrease in 2012 primarily due to the change in seasonal opening and closing dates of certain Glacier Park properties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	RevPAR increased due to improved results, primarily driven by the Lake McDonald Lodge and Glacier View Inn.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	The number of passengers increased across all of the Travel Recreation Group s attractions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	Revenue per passenger increased mainly driven by increased ticket prices at the Banff Gondola attraction.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S5	During 2012, approximately 65 percent of revenues and 77 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S6	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenues and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S7	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S8	Corporate activities expense of $9.4 million in 2012 increased from $7.7 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P58_S9	This increase was primarily due to costs related to the amendment and restatement of the Company s shareholder rights plan as well as increased performance-based compensation expense.
884219_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	In 2012, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $4.9 million, as compared to $3.8 million in 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	These charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of facility consolidations as well as the elimination of certain positions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The effective tax rate for 2012 was 77.8 percent, as compared to 29.5 percent for 2011.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The high rate for 2012, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to the charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million representing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $45.8 million as of December 31, 2013 , as compared to $114.2 million as of December 31, 2012 , with the decrease primarily due to the payment of a $50.8 million special cash dividend in November 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	During 2013 , the Company generated net cash flows from operating activities of $6.1 million primarily driven by operating results, mostly offset by changes in working capital.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	Management believes that Viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had $41.5 million of its cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S6	Of the total amount, $32.6 million was held in Canada, $5.4 million in the United Kingdom, $2.0 million in Germany and $1.5 million in the United Arab Emirates.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S7	There were certain historical earnings related to its Canadian operations which, if repatriated to the United States, would result in incremental income tax expense.
884219_14_ITEM7_P60_S8	The incremental tax liability as of December 31, 2013 that would result assuming all foreign cash balances were repatriated to the United States would be approximately $1.0 million.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The two larger items in other non-cash items consisted of $5.2 million of share-based compensation expense and $5.4 million of impairment charges.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The changes in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $21.0 million decrease in customer deposits, a $15.4 million decrease in accounts payable and a $11.7 million decrease in accrued compensation.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	2012 - Non-cash items primarily consisted of $11.3 million of deferred income taxes related to the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards and $7.2 million of share-based compensation expense.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	The changes in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a $4.7 million decrease in restructuring liabilities partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in accounts payable.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	2011 - Non-cash items primarily consisted of $4.4 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.8 million of restructuring charges.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	The changes in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an $18.1 million increase in receivables and a $3.9 million decrease in restructuring liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	This was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in customer deposits and a $4.6 million increase in accrued compensation.
884219_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	2013 - Cash used in investing activities was driven by $36.1 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the construction of the Glacier Skywalk at the Travel Recreation Group as well as equipment and computer hardware at the Marketing Events U.S. segment.
884219_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Partially offsetting this was $14.3 million of proceeds from the sale of a facility and related land in the Marketing Events Group and the sale of land from a discontinued operation.
884219_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	In 2013, the Travel Recreation Group paid $12.7 million in capital expenditures relating to the Glacier Skywalk.
884219_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	Management projects that the Glacier Skywalk will generate approximately $4.5 million to $5 million in revenue and an operating income margin of more than 50 percent in 2014.

884219_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Capital is defined as total debt and capital lease obligations plus total stockholders equity.
884219_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	In May 2011, Viad entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility ).
884219_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Credit Facility provides for a $130 million revolving line of credit, which may be increased up to an additional $50 million under certain circumstances.
884219_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The term of the Credit Facility is five years (expiring on May 18, 2016 ) and borrowings are to be used for general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions) and to support up to $50 million of letters of credit.
884219_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The lenders have a first perfected security interest in all of the personal property of Viad and GES, including 65 percent of the capital stock of top-tier foreign subsidiaries.

884219_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	Commitment fees and letters of credit fees are also tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	The fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility are currently 0.35 percent annually.
884219_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for facilities of this type, including a fixed-charge coverage ratio, leverage ratio and dividend and share repurchase limits.
884219_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Significant other covenants include limitations on: investments, additional indebtedness, sales/leases of assets, acquisitions, consolidations or mergers and liens on property.
884219_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , Viad was in compliance with all covenants.
884219_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	In December 2012, the Credit Facility was amended to remove the limitation on share repurchases of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year pursuant to certain conditions.
884219_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The amendment also allows dividends to be declared and paid in excess of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year, as well as distributions on its capital stock, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Facility, exists.
884219_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Effective November 14, 2013, the Credit Facility was amended to remove the liquidity covenant that required Viad to maintain at all times not less than $50 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalent investments, as that term is defined in the Credit Facility.
884219_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	With the amendment, the Credit Facility no longer requires any minimum amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalent investments.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Guarantees As of December 31, 2013 , Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by the Company s subsidiary operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2013 would be $13.7 million .
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities and expire through October 2017.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_14_ITEM7_P75_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Share Repurchases Viad has announced the authorization of its Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock on the open market from time to time at prevailing market prices.
884219_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	No shares were repurchased on the open market during 2013.
884219_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	During 2012, Viad repurchased 23,183 shares for $526,000.
884219_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , 1,030,438 shares remain available for repurchase.

884219_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	The following table presents Viad s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 :
884219_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	(1) Estimated contributions related to multi-employer benefit plans are excluded from the table above.
884219_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding those obligations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	(2) Purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
884219_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	(3) Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $29.9 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2013 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
884219_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , there was a remaining environmental remediation liability of $5.0 million related to previously sold operations of which $353,000 is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Other current liabilities and $4.7 million under the caption Other deferred items and liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 totaled $20.3 million, $20.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Viad does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
884219_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	See Notes 9 , 18 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The SEC has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including: the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events U.S. segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level, which represents all domestic operations of GES.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	Furthermore, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events International segment is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S7	For the Marketing Events International segment the reporting units are GES United Kingdom and GES Canada.
884219_14_ITEM7_P85_S8	Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaska Denali Travel are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Viad had total goodwill of $129.5 million consisting of $85.3 million related to the Marketing Events Group and $44.2 million related to the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	The following table summarizes goodwill balances by reporting unit and segment as of December 31:
884219_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	Furthermore, the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_14_ITEM7_P87_S4	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Viad had aggregate goodwill of $129.5 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Furthermore, as a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed in October 2013 , the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test was 139 percent , 58 percent and 59 percent for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	For the Brewster and Alaska Denali Travel reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 54 percent and 15 percent , respectively, as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenues, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment charges.
884219_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	See Results of Operations above and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the goodwill impairment loss recorded during 2013 related to Glacier Park.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S5	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $ 77.0 million and $82.2 million , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P90_S8	The Company also evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits, given its recent utilization history.
884219_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	to a 10-year carryforward period and begin to expire in 2019.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Based on the Company s assessment, it was determined during the fourth quarter of 2012 that the weight of the evidence indicated that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards no longer met the more-likely-than-not test regarding the realization of those assets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $ 13.4 million related to all of its foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	During 2013, the Company generated additional foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.9 million for which an additional valuation allowance was recorded.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	However, the Company also determined, due to the taxable income associated with the Glacier Park possessory interest the Company received in the first quarter of 2014, it was more-likely-than-not that a portion of its previously existing foreign tax credit carryforwards would be utilized.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S4	Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company reversed $ 4.1 million of its valuation allowance related to those tax credits.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S5	Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to income tax expense of $ 2.2 million and a decrease of $300,000 to deferred tax assets for a total decrease to income tax expense of $2.5 million related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with its foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S6	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 96.0 million and $ 82.0 million , respectively, for which the Company had deferred tax assets of $ 4.8 million and $ 1.8 million , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S7	The state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates from 2014 through 2033.
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S8	During 2013, the Company increased its valuation allowance related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards by $ 329,000 .
884219_14_ITEM7_P92_S9	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had a valuation allowance of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively, related to those state and foreign deferred tax assets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	If such a change in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Insurance liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability and property loss claims.
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to the Company s retention limit) related to Viad s continuing operations was $20.0 million as of December 31, 2013 .
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	Of this total, $12.5 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $7.5 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S3	Viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling $5.0 million as of December 31, 2013 , primarily related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S4	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_14_ITEM7_P95_S5	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $200,000 to $500,000 on a per claim basis.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $6.6 million, $5.6 million and $7.6 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	In addition, as of December 31, 2013 , Viad has recorded insurance liabilities of $5.0 million related to continuing operations in excess of the self-insured levels for which Viad remains the primary obligor.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S4	Of this total, $1.7 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $3.3 million related to general liability claims.
884219_14_ITEM7_P96_S5	The Company has presented these amounts as other deferred items and liabilities with a corresponding receivable in other investments and assets.
884219_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.4 million to its funded pension plans and $942,000 to its unfunded pension plans in 2014.
884219_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $950,000 to the plans in 2014.
884219_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2013 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.0 percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2012 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5 percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.3 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $90,000.
884219_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $5.2 million , $7.2 million and $4.4 million , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	Furthermore, the total tax benefits related to such costs were $1.9 million , $2.6 million and $1.6 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7_P103_S3	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
884219_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price until the time of settlement.
884219_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility, the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding, the expected dividend yield on Viad s common stock and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	While the Company has not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s future results of operations.
884219_14_ITEM7_P105_S3	See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P105_S4	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Viad s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Forward-Looking Statements: As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new or renewal business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	Among other things, natural disasters, gains and losses of customers, consumer demand patterns, labor relations, purchasing decisions related to customer demand for exhibition and event services, existing and new competition, industry alliances, consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which Viad competes, acquisitions, capital allocations, adverse developments in liabilities associated with discontinued operations and any deterioration in the economy and other risks discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, included in this Annual Report, may individually or in combination impact future results.
884219_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere, economic, competitive, governmental, technological, capital marketplace and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of $30.8 million and $42.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	During 2013 and 2012 , an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $11.3 million and a gain of $7.5 million , respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses, gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period-to-period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange rate variances on segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations:
884219_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As the Canadian operations generated aggregate operating income in 2013 , Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $855,000 from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $2.0 million.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As the United Kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in 2013 , Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $138,000 from the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $828,000.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As the German operations generated aggregate operating income in 2013 , Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $37,000 from the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Euro would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $126,000.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Periodically, Brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume, by fuel product, to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract, which is generally no longer than one year.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The main objective of Viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins.
884219_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	There were no fuel contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013 or 2012 .
884219_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
884219_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, are provided in this Annual Report immediately prior to the Index to Financial Statements.
884219_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	Viad has adopted a Code of Ethics for all directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
884219_14_ITEM10_P0_S1	A copy of the Company s Code of Ethics is available at Viad s website at www.viad.com/pdf/corpgovernance/CodeofEthics.pdf and is also available without charge to any shareholder upon request by writing to: Viad Corp, 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900, Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

884219_14_ITEM15_P1_S0	SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Annual Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 7, 2014 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P2_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of Viad Corp and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
884219_14_ITEM15_P3_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_14_ITEM15_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_14_ITEM15_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_14_ITEM15_P4_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_14_ITEM15_P4_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_14_ITEM15_P5_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_14_ITEM15_P6_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	The objective of this assessment was to determine whether Viad s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P7_S2	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013 , Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_14_ITEM15_P7_S3	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this Annual Report.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_14_ITEM15_P8_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_14_ITEM15_P9_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated March 7, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates.
884219_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
884219_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:
884219_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Viad considers all highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
884219_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company s investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or market.
884219_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_14_ITEM15_P28_S3	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	Viad capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software.
884219_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_14_ITEM15_P29_S4	These costs are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 31 of each year.
884219_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_14_ITEM15_P30_S4	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance .
884219_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Viad has Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash the Company could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_14_ITEM15_P32_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in the consolidated statements of operations.

884219_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	As previously discussed above, the equitable adjustments to the outstanding stock options resulting from the special cash dividend paid on November 14, 2013 reduced the exercise price and increased the number of shares of common stock underlying such options.
884219_14_ITEM15_P62_S3	The following table summarizes information concerning stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2013 :

884219_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	In December 2012, the Credit Facility was amended to remove the limitation on share repurchases of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year pursuant to certain conditions.
884219_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	The amendment allows share repurchases unless the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Facility, exists.
884219_14_ITEM15_P94_S2	The amendment also allows dividends to be declared and paid in excess of $10 million in the aggregate per calendar year, as well as distributions on its capital stock, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00 or a default or an unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Facility, exists.

884219_14_ITEM15_P98_S5	The fair value of debt was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity.
884219_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The fair value of an asset or liability is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
884219_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The fair value guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
884219_14_ITEM15_P100_S2	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value.
884219_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Viad measures its money market mutual funds and certain other mutual fund investments at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.
884219_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following tables:

884219_14_ITEM15_P102_S6	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_14_ITEM15_P102_S7	The estimated fair value of debt obligations is disclosed in Note 9 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	During 2013, Viad had certain non-financial assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
884219_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	These assets include goodwill and certain property and equipment for which impairment losses were recorded during 2013.
884219_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following table:
884219_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	(1) See Notes 5 and 7 for details of the impairment charges.
884219_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	The following are the components of basic and diluted income per share:
884219_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	(1) Diluted income per share amount cannot exceed basic income per share.
884219_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	Options to purchase 47,000 , 110,000 and 304,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, but were not included in the computation of dilutive shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
884219_14_ITEM15_P106_S2	Additionally, 415,000 , 304,000 and 336,000 share-based compensation awards were considered dilutive and included in the computation of diluted income per share in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	Plan Viad funds its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s ESOP portion of the Viad Corp Capital Accumulation Plan (the 401(k) Plan ).
884219_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	All eligible employees of Viad and its participating affiliates, other than certain employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements that do not expressly provide for participation of such employees in an employee stock ownership plan, may participate in the employee stock ownership feature within the 401(k) Plan.
884219_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	In 1989, the ESOP borrowed $40.0 million (guaranteed by Viad) to purchase treasury shares from the Company.
884219_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	In 2004, Viad borrowed $12.2 million under its revolving credit agreement to pay in full the outstanding ESOP loan and obtain release of Viad from its guarantee of the loan.
884219_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	In connection with the loan payoff, the ESOP entered into a $12.4 million loan with Viad maturing in June 2009 calling for minimum quarterly principal payments of $250,000 plus interest.
884219_14_ITEM15_P108_S3	The same amount, representing unearned employee benefits, was recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity.
884219_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	In 2007, the loan agreement between the ESOP and Viad was extended to December 31, 2016.
884219_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the balance of the ESOP loan was $44,000 and is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Unearned employee benefits and other.
884219_14_ITEM15_P109_S2	The liability is reduced as the ESOP makes principal payments on the borrowing, and the amount offsetting stockholders equity is reduced as stock is allocated to employees and benefits are charged to expense.
884219_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	Information regarding ESOP transactions is as follows:
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	Shares were released for allocation to participants based upon the ratio of the current year s principal and interest payments to the sum of the total principal and interest payments expected over the remaining life of the loan.
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	Viad recorded expense of $1.3 million , $1.7 million and $1.6 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S2	Unallocated shares held by the 401(k) Plan totaled 4,361 and 130,577 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S3	Shares allocated during 2013 and 2012 totaled 126,216 and 162,703 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S4	In January 2014, the 4,361 shares remaining in the ESOP as of December 31, 2013 had been fully exhausted.
884219_14_ITEM15_P111_S5	Future matching contributions on employee deferrals will be made from shares held in treasury.
884219_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Viad has authorized five million and two million shares of Preferred Stock and Junior Participating Preferred Stock, respectively, none of which was outstanding on December 31, 2013 .

884219_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) by component were as follows:
884219_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	The following table presents information about reclassification adjustments out of AOCI:
884219_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of income tax expense and the amount that would be computed using the statutory federal income tax rates:
884219_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts or had previously conducted operations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	These include U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions, and certain foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company recognized an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of approximately $ 736,000 as there were no accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S2	As of December 31, 2013, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of $ 20,000 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S3	Viad classifies interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S4	The tax expense impact of the uncertain tax positions was $ 200,000 due to tax credit carryforwards that were available to offset the expense.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S5	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $ 293,000 of its uncertain tax positions could be resolved or settled within the next twelve months, which would reduce the amount of accrued income taxes payable.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S6	During 2011, Viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of $ 103,000 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S7	These tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S8	In addition to the above, Viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $ 636,000 as of both December 31, 2013 and 2012.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S9	In addition, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of $ 450,000 and $ 418,000 , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S10	Future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations (net of federal tax effects, if applicable).
884219_14_ITEM15_P118_S11	Viad believes that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to discontinued operations will be recognized or settled during the next 12 months as the statute of limitations related to this item will lapse on December 31, 2014.
884219_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	The following represents a reconciliation of the total amounts of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties):
884219_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Viad s 2010 through 2013 U.S. federal tax years and various state tax years from 2009 through 2013 remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities.
884219_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	Additionally, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 remain subject to examination due to federal net operating loss carryback claims.
884219_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	In addition, tax years from 2010 through 2013 related to Viad s foreign taxing jurisdictions also remain subject to examination.
884219_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	Viad classifies liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as non-current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets unless they are expected to be paid within the next year.
884219_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (including interest and penalties) of $ 1.8 million and $ 1.1 million , respectively, which were classified as non-current liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 related to the following:
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S3	The Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S4	The Company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S5	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $ 77.0 million and $ 82.2 million , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S6	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S7	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the Company s recent operating history, taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S8	The Company also evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits, given its recent utilization history.
884219_14_ITEM15_P123_S9	These tax credits are subject to a 10-year carryforward period and begin to expire in 2019.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	Based on the Company s assessment, it was determined during the fourth quarter of 2012 that the weight of the evidence indicated that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards no longer met the more-likely-than-not test regarding the realization of those assets.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $ 13.4 million related to all of its foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	During 2013, the Company generated additional foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.9 million for which an additional valuation allowance was recorded.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S3	However, the Company also determined, due to the taxable income associated with the Glacier Park possessory interest the Company received in the first quarter of 2014, it was more-likely-than-not that a portion of its previously existing foreign tax credit carryforwards would be utilized.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S4	Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company reversed $ 4.1 million of its valuation allowance related to those tax credits.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S5	Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to income tax expense of $ 2.2 million and a decrease of $ 300,000 to deferred tax assets for a total decrease to income tax expense of $ 2.5 million related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with its foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S6	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 96.0 million and $ 82.0 million , respectively, for which the Company had deferred tax assets of $ 4.8 million and $ 1.8 million , respectively.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S7	The state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates from 2014 through 2033.
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S8	During 2013, the Company increased its valuation allowance related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards by $ 329,000 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P124_S9	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Viad had a valuation allowance of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively, related to those state and foreign deferred tax assets.
884219_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	With respect to all other deferred tax assets, management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more-likely-than-not.
884219_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	As noted above, Viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets.
884219_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	As a result, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets, which is primarily dependent on Viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.
884219_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	In future periods, it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of Viad s deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_14_ITEM15_P126_S3	If such a change in the valuation allowance were to occur, it would result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_14_ITEM15_P126_S4	As of December 31, 2013, Viad had tax credit carryforwards related to alternative minimum tax of $ 11.3 million that may be carried forward indefinitely.

884219_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	The fair value of the domestic plans assets by asset class was as follows:
884219_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	The significant amount of investments held in cash in the domestic pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2012 was due to a change in the investment custodian during December 2012.
884219_14_ITEM15_P140_S1	All securities held by the previous custodian were liquidated to cash and transferred to the new custodian in December 2012.
884219_14_ITEM15_P140_S2	During January and February 2013, the new custodian invested the plans assets in a mix of equities and fixed income securities approximating the same mixes as December 31, 2011.
884219_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	Viad employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income securities is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
884219_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
884219_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities.
884219_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	Furthermore, equity securities are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth and value.
884219_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements.
884219_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	Viad utilizes a building-block approach in determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.
884219_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
884219_14_ITEM15_P144_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
884219_14_ITEM15_P144_S3	The long-term portfolio return also considers diversification and rebalancing.
884219_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed relative to Viad s assumed rates for reasonableness and appropriateness.

884219_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2013 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.0 percent , declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_14_ITEM15_P158_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2012 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5 percent , declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_14_ITEM15_P158_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $113,000 .
884219_14_ITEM15_P158_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 by approximately $1.3 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $90,000 .

884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S1	The financial risks of participating in these multi-employer pension plans generally include the fact that assets contributed to the plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S2	Furthermore, if a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S3	In addition, if Viad were to discontinue its participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.
884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S4	Viad also contributes to defined contribution plans pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements, which are generally not subject to the funding risks inherent in defined benefit pension plans.
884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S5	The overall level of Viad s contributions to its multi-employer plans may significantly vary from year to year based on the demand for union-represented labor to support the Company s operations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P159_S6	Viad does not have any minimum contribution requirements for future periods pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements for individually significant multi-employer plans.

884219_14_ITEM15_P172_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by Viad s subsidiary operations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P172_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_14_ITEM15_P172_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2013 would be $13.7 million .

884219_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	The mission of the Marketing Events Group is to create the world s most meaningful and memorable experiences for show organizers, brand marketers, event attendees and retail shopping centers.

884219_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	The growth strategy for the Marketing Events Group, which is comprised of Global Experience Specialists, Inc. and affiliates ( GES ), is to establish GES as the preferred global, full-service provider for live events, with further reach to corporate and consumer events, exhibitions, congresses and conferences.
884219_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Company expects to do this through the acquisition of businesses that compete in industry sectors with higher profit margins, add new, value-added services for GES customers that complement and enhance its existing businesses and further leverage GES global capabilities.

884219_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Viad s businesses and operating results are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Viad s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by increases and decreases in the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Operating results for the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the operating results for the Marketing Events Group are adversely affected.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Similarly, many of the retail shopping mall and lifestyle center clients of the Marketing Events Group may reduce marketing expenditures when economic conditions deteriorate.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenues from the Travel Recreation Group businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.

884219_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of those foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Viad has not hedged its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenue, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	During 2014 , the Marketing Events Group derived approximately 26 percent of its revenue and 33 percent of its segment operating income from its International segment.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Travel Recreation Group derived approximately 75 percent of its 2014 revenue and 90 percent of its 2014 segment operating income from its Canadian operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	For this segment, Canadian operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and, therefore, revenue and segment operating income in the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Exhibition rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer).
884219_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than when they have historically been held.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins in a given period if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As a consequence of those factors, the operating results for those businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees or others, to travel.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities could adversely impact revenue.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Although no single client accounted for more than 6.3 percent of the revenue of any of Viad s reporting segments in 2014, the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments have a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	The loss of any of these large clients could adversely affect Viad s results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, revenue of the Marketing Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing or other services.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	When the Marketing Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the show organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform those electrical and plumbing services, subject in each case to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, some of those facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of those services.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing Events Group has those relationships moves those services in-house, Viad s revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The business activities of the Marketing Events U.S. and International segments are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Those relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take those customers to a competitor.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	new regulatory requirements; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If Viad makes changes to its business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect its business operations, the Company may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Exhibition and event activity for the U.S. and International segments varies significantly depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Travel Recreation Group businesses are generally also seasonal, experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Those quarters accounted for 85 percent of the segment s 2014 revenue.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could adversely affect the operating results of Viad s businesses.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	From time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays and cost overruns, failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals and the inability to successfully integrate into Viad s ongoing businesses, as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with Viad s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. and International segments rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities and customer facilities.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If they were unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on these businesses and their results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on its businesses and operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Similarly, disruption of transportation services could adversely affect the ability of the Marketing Events Group to supply time-sensitive holiday-themed exhibits and experiences to retail shopping mall and lifestyle center customers and could cause the cancellation of the exhibits and experiences.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In either event, Viad s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Moreover, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could adversely affect the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans to which Viad contributes may have an adverse impact on operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Viad s contributions to those multi-employer plans in 2014 and 2013 totaled $23.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Viad does not directly manage those multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to those plans.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have an adverse impact on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Competition in the exhibition and events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting operating results.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If Viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment, results of operations could be adversely affected.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food and fresh meats.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Some of those businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, the subject of litigation.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions, and reserves or insurance become inadequate.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Such catastrophic events could impact the Marketing Events Group s production facilities, preventing the Company from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and also could cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels and other public venues.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Such catastrophic events also could adversely impact the Travel Recreation Group businesses, which are heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	The guests serviced by the Travel Recreation Group tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions during a given season, and catastrophic events could impede the guests ability to travel, interrupt the Company s business operations and/or cause damage to the Company s properties.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, Viad could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm the Company s reputation.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Viad s businesses store and process a significant amount of personally identifiable information in connection with the services they provide to customers.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If the Company s security controls over personal data, training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices and procedures do not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, the Company s reputation could be harmed, and the Company could face legal exposure to customers and other liabilities under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of the Company s services also enable its customers to store and process personal data.
884219_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Perceptions that the Company s services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Marketing Events U.S. segment operates 19 offices and 24 multi-use facilities (manufacturing, sales and design, office, storage and/or warehouse and truck marshaling yards).
884219_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 592,100 square feet.
884219_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two of the multi-use facilities are owned; all other properties are leased.
884219_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Marketing Events International segment operates 12 offices and 22 multi-use facilities, with three offices and nine multi-use facilities in Canada, four offices and eight multi-use facilities in the United Kingdom, one office and two multi-use facilities in Germany, one office and three multi-use facilities in the United Arab Emirates and three offices and one multi-use facility in the Netherlands.
884219_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 133,600 square feet.
884219_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment operates four offices, 20 retail stores, one bus terminal, five garages, an icefield attraction, an observation platform attraction, a gondola lift attraction, a boat tour attraction and 12 hotels/lodges (including ancillary food service and recreational facilities).
884219_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	All of the facilities are in the United States or Canada.
884219_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	The bus terminal, all of the hotels/lodges, one office, four garages, the icefield attraction, the gondola lift attraction, the observation platform attraction and the boat tour attraction are owned.
884219_15_ITEM2_P2_S3	One garage and three offices are leased, and three hotels/lodges, an office and all of the garages and attractions are situated on land subject to multiple long-term ground leases with the Canadian government.
884219_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	The Company s headquarters are leased and approximate 24,700 square feet, and are located at 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900 in Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565.
884219_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	Management believes that the Company s facilities in the aggregate are adequate and suitable for their purposes and that capacity is sufficient for current needs.
884219_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure for actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM3_P0_S4	Refer to Business - Government Regulation and Compliance in Item 1; also refer to Note 21 , Litigation, Claims, Contingencies and Other of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

884219_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Income from discontinued operations of $ 14.4 million primarily related to the gain on the possessory interest and personal property at Glacier Park Marketing Events U.S. Marketing Events International Travel Recreation Group Non-GAAP Measure: The following discussion includes a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Adjusted EBITDA is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation, debt service costs, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA primarily as a performance measure and believes that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP measure is net income attributable to Viad.
884219_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	expenses and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment charges or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Because Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the Company s performance.
884219_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
884219_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $14.8 million from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher segment operating income at both the Marketing Events Group and Travel Recreation Group and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by higher corporate costs.
884219_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher segment operating results at the Travel Recreation Group, as well as lower corporate costs and restructuring charges.
884219_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	See Results of Operations below for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Results of Operations: 2014 vs. 2013 :
884219_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total revenue was $1.1 billion, as compared to $953.3 million in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in revenue was primarily driven by positive show rotation, continued same-show growth, and the acquisitions of onPeak, Blitz and N200 in the Marketing Events Group U.S. and International segments.
884219_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	The increase in the Travel Recreation Group revenue was primarily due to Brewster s attractions, with the Glacier Skywalk (opened May 2014) driving growth at our attractions and the acquisition of the West Glacier Properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total segment operating income was $59.9 million, as compared to $41.9 million in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase in segment operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and increased margins in all three reportable segments.
884219_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Viad shareholders was $2.02, as compared to $0.96 in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income from discontinued operations attributable to Viad was $11.6 million, as compared to income of $2.1 million in 2013, primarily related to the expiration of Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service on December 31, 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company s 2013 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business have been reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Variances Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	During 2014, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in decreases in revenue and segment operating income of $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, as compared to 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on year over year revenue and segment operating results from Viad s international operations, excluding the effect of 2014 acquisitions:
884219_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Viad s results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Exhibition and event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the frequency and timing of shows (some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters).
884219_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The rotation metric helps explain the show movement between quarters and years.
884219_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next.
884219_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue for the Marketing Events U.S. segment was $710.8 million in 2014, up 13.0 percent, as compared to $628.9 million in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Segment operating income increased $10.4 million to $21.4 million, as compared to 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Organic increases, excluding the acquisition of onPeak, were $75.9 million in revenue and $10.6 million in operating income.
884219_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Revenue was primarily impacted by positive show rotation revenue of approximately $69 million, base same-show revenue growth of 6.4 percent, and higher revenue from corporate clients, partially offset by the loss of the International Consumer Electronics Show.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue derived from shows that the Company produced out of the same city during the same quarter in each year.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Base same-shows represented 39 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenue in 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Operating income was also affected by a non-recurring gain of $4.8 million in 2013 related to the sale of a facility as well as higher performance-based incentives in 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Revenue for the Marketing Events International segment in 2014 was affected by exchange rate variances, which had a favorable impact on revenue and segment operating income of $4.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	Excluding exchange rate variances, revenue increased by $15.9 million, or 6.9 percent, and segment operating results increased by $1.0 million, or 11.2 percent.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S5	Organic growth, excluding the acquisitions of Blitz and N200 as well as the impact of exchange rate variances, was $5.3 million in revenue and $0.8 million in operating income.
884219_15_ITEM7_P24_S6	These increases were primarily driven by new business wins, partially offset by negative show rotation revenue of approximately $4 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenue is affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest growth.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	For the 2015 full year, management expects U.S. base same-show revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate and show rotation to have a net negative impact on revenue of approximately $75 million versus 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Additionally, management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2014 will have an unfavorable impact on the Marketing Events Group s 2015 full year revenue and operating income of approximately $25 million and $1 million, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	Management remains focused on improving the profitability of the Marketing Events U.S. segment through continued efforts to more effectively manage labor costs by driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning that reduces the ratio of labor costs to revenue.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	Improving this metric is a top priority of management and the Company continues to develop and enhance tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement and benchmarking.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	Additionally, management is executing a strategic growth plan to transform the Marketing Events Group into the preferred global full service provider to the live events market, which includes adding complementary and higher-margin service lines to its existing official services contracting business.
884219_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	In connection with this plan, the Company completed the following key acquisitions during 2014:
884219_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Blitz, a leading audio-visual staging and creative services provider for the live events industry in Europe.
884219_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The addition of Blitz, effective September 16, 2014, provided international scale to the Marketing Events Group s existing U.S. in-house audio-visual operations that were launched in late 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	onPeak, which provides event accommodations services to approximately 60 percent of the top 250 U.S. events.
884219_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Upon acquiring these companies, effective October 7, 2014, the Marketing Events Group became the leading event accommodations service provider in the United States.
884219_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	N200, Europe s leading event registration and data intelligence service provider for the live events industry.
884219_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	This acquisition, effective November 24, 2014, affords clients yet another value-added service and adds another high-margin business to the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Collectively, the acquisitions of Blitz, onPeak and N200 contributed revenue and segment EBITDA of $16.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, to the Marketing Events Group s 2014 results.
884219_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Segment EBITDA is defined as segment operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense.
884219_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	In 2015, management expects these acquisitions to collectively provide revenue of about $62 million to $67 million and segment EBITDA of about $14.5 million to $15.5 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	These acquisitions offer cross-selling opportunities across the Marketing Events Group s customer base, which is resulting in expanded business relationships with existing customers and creating new competitive advantages for the Marketing Events Group as it increasingly becomes a full-service provider for live events.
884219_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment experiences peak activity during the summer months.
884219_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	During 2014, 85 percent of its revenue was earned in the second and third quarters.
884219_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Results for the Travel Recreation Group segment for 2014 were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenue and segment operating income of $4.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, as compared to 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Excluding exchange rate variances, revenue increased by $16.8 million, or 15.5 percent, and segment operating income increased by $7.2 million, or 32.9 percent.
884219_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenue by line of business:
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The increases in revenue in 2014 were primarily driven by attractions and hospitality.
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The improved results from attractions were primarily due to the opening of the new Glacier Skywalk attraction and increased passenger counts at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, the Banff Gondola, and the Banff Lake Cruise.
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Hospitality revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of the West Glacier Properties on July 1, 2014, which added $4.6 million of revenue.
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	Excluding the West Glacier Properties, hospitality revenue decreased slightly versus the comparable periods in 2013 primarily due to declines at the Denali Backcountry Lodge and Glacier Park Lodge.
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The Denali Backcountry Lodge was negatively affected by flooding at the end of June 2014 and Glacier Park Lodge experienced especially strong occupancy in 2013 as a result of its centennial anniversary.
884219_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	Declines at these properties were partially offset by increases at the Banff International Hotel, the Mount Royal Hotel and the Glacier View Inn, which benefitted from strong visitation to Banff and Jasper National Parks, as well as Grouse Mountain Lodge driven by the Company s renovations in 2012 and 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Transportation revenue decreased as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances and reduced business for the Denali Backcountry Adventure.
884219_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Package tours revenue increased primarily due to higher group and individual business, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate variances.
884219_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Management uses the following key business metrics to evaluate the Travel Recreation Group hospitality business: revenue per available room ( RevPAR ), average daily rate ( ADR ) and occupancy.
884219_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	These metrics are commonly used in the hospitality industry to measure performance.
884219_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue for comparable hospitality properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability.
884219_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to generate.
884219_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Increases in ADR at hospitality properties lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on margins than increases in occupancy.
884219_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs), as well as increased ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).
884219_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Management evaluates the performance of the Travel Recreation Group attractions business utilizing the number of passengers and total attractions revenue per passenger.
884219_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The number of passengers allows management to assess the volume of visitor activity at each attraction during the period.
884219_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	Total attractions revenue per passenger is calculated as total attractions revenue divided by the total number of passengers at all Travel Recreation Group attractions during the period.
884219_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Total attractions revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	Total attractions revenue per passenger measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business.
884219_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	For Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the positive or negative effects that result from translating.
884219_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	The same-store key performance indicators presented below exclude the hospitality metrics for the West Glacier Properties (acquired July 1, 2014), as well as the attraction metrics for the Glacier Skywalk attraction (opened May 2014) as they do not have comparable results for the same periods in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The increase in RevPAR in 2014 was primarily due to higher occupancy and ADR at the Mount Royal Hotel, the Banff International Hotel, and the Glacier View Inn driven by increased visitation to Banff and Jasper National Parks.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Grouse Mountain Lodge also experienced higher RevPAR driven by the Company s renovations in 2012 and 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	These increases were partially offset by reduced occupancy at the Denali Backcountry Lodge, which experienced flooding early in its operating season, and at Glacier Park Lodge, which experienced especially strong occupancy in 2013 as a result of its centennial anniversary.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	The decrease in ADR was primarily driven by offering lower rates at the Prince of Wales Hotel in response to softer demand as compared to prior year and higher occupancy during the off-peak season at the Grouse Mountain Lodge when rates were lower.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	The decrease in room nights available from 2013 to 2014 was due to changes in seasonal opening and closing dates of certain Glacier Park properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	Management schedules opening and closing dates to optimize profitability based on anticipated travel patterns, and forecasted occupancy levels and operating expenses.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S6	The number of passengers increased in 2014 at all three of Brewster s attractions (Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, Banff Gondola, and Banff Lake Cruise).
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S7	The attractions benefited from increased park visitation traffic, favorable weather conditions, and strong combination ticket sales with the Glacier Skywalk.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S8	The Banff Lake Cruise experienced a substantial increase in individual traffic as a result of implementing additional departure times in 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S9	During 2014, approximately 75 percent of revenue and 90 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S10	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S11	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S12	For the 2015 full year, management expects the Travel Recreation Group s revenue to increase by a low single-digit rate from 2014 driven by the growth of the underlying business, largely offset by unfavorable currency translation.
884219_15_ITEM7_P41_S13	Management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus 2014 will have an unfavorable impact on the Travel Recreation Group s 2015 full year revenue and operating income of approximately $10 million and $3 million, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	By leveraging economies of scale and scope and repositioning the acquired assets for higher returns, management expects to realize continued revenue growth and expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins in future years.
884219_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Corporate activities expense of $14.3 million in 2014 increased from $6.8 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	This increase was primarily related to acquisition transaction-related costs of $4.2 million, CEO transition costs of $2.7 million, and higher 401(k) employer matching contributions expense due to the depletion of the Company s common stock held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company s 401(k).
884219_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	Matching contributions are now funded from shares of Viad common stock held in treasury which have a higher cost to the Company.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2014, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after-tax) primarily related to updated estimates of facility contractual arrangements and the elimination of certain positions in the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2013, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $3.8 million ($2.6 million after-tax) primarily related to facility consolidations and the elimination of certain positions in the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, restructuring charges related to the elimination of certain positions in the Travel Recreation Group and at Viad corporate were also recorded in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	In 2014, Viad recorded impairment charges of $0.9 million ($0.5 million after-tax) at the Marketing Events Group primarily related to the write-off of certain internally developed software.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	In 2013, Viad recorded impairment charges of approximately $3.1 million ($1.6 million after-tax) related to the non-cash write-down of goodwill at Glacier Park of $2.1 million ($1.0 million after-tax) and $1.0 million ($0.6 million after-tax) related to the write-off of certain assets within the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	The effective tax rate for 2014 was 0.2 percent, as compared to 30.1 percent for 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2014 was primarily due to a benefit related to the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign tax credits.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S7	During the third quarter of 2014, it was determined that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credits, for which a valuation allowance had previously been established, once again met the more-likely-than-not test in the accounting standards regarding the realization of those assets.
884219_15_ITEM7_P43_S8	Accordingly, Viad recorded a tax benefit of $10.1 million to income tax expense during the 2014 third quarter.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	On December 31, 2013, Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service to operate lodging, tour and transportation and other hospitality services for Glacier National Park expired.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Upon completion of the contract term, Viad received cash payments in January 2014 totaling $25.0 million for the Company s possessory interest.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $21.5 million and an after-tax gain of $13.5 million that was recorded as income from discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	In addition, 2014 income from discontinued operations included approximately $0.7 million, net of tax, related to the gain on sale of personal property at Glacier Park, as well as an insurance recovery of $0.3 million, net of tax, and adjustments to reserves related to certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	The Company s 2013 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business have been reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	Accordingly, for the 2013 full year, approximately $19 million in revenue and $4 million in operating income has been reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	Glacier Park continues to generate revenue from the seven properties it owns: St. Mary Lodge in St. Mary, Montana; Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, Montana; Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Montana; the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta; the West Glacier Motel Cabins in West Glacier, Montana; and Motel Lake McDonald and the Apgar Village Lodge, which are located inside Glacier National Park.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	Glacier Park also continues to operate the food and beverage operations and package tour and transportation services with respect to these properties and the retail shops located near Glacier National Park.
884219_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	In addition, 2013 income from discontinued operations included $1.1 million, net of tax, primarily related to the sale of land associated with a previously sold operation.
884219_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Total revenue was $953.3 million, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by negative show rotation and services provided in 2012 in connection with the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games by the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Total segment operating income was $41.9 million, as compared to $38.2 million in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in operating results, despite revenue declines, was primarily driven by continued same-show growth and focus on margin improvement at the Marketing Events Group, as well as expanded revenues at all three operating units within the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Viad shareholders was $0.96, as compared to $0.17 in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income from discontinued operations attributable to Viad was $2.1 million and $2.5 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	This related partly to the operations of the Glacier Park concession contract of $1.0 million and $1.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Company s 2013 and 2012 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business have been reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	Additionally, the Company had income from the sale of land associated with a previously sold operation of $1.1 million and $0.6 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Variances Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	During 2013, foreign exchange rate variances resulted in decreases in revenues and segment operating income of $7.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as compared to 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The following table summarizes the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenue and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations:
884219_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Viad s results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Revenue for the Marketing Events U.S. segment was $628.9 million for 2013, down 7.1 percent, as compared to $676.8 million in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The decrease was primarily due to negative show rotation revenue of approximately $54 million, partially offset by base same-show revenue increases of 3.1 percent.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	Base same-shows represented 46 percent of Marketing Events U.S. segment revenue in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The 2013 segment operating income was $11.0 million, as compared to $5.6 million in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	The improved operating results were primarily due to lower performance-based incentives, the third quarter gain on sale of a facility in New Jersey and ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	Results for the Marketing Events International segment were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenue of $4.3 million and segment operating income of $0.2 million, as compared to 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S6	Excluding exchange rate variances, 2013 revenue decreased by $6.6 million, or 2.7 percent, and segment operating income decreased by $3.0 million, or 24.5 percent.
884219_15_ITEM7_P51_S7	These decreases were primarily driven by services provided for the 2012 London Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, partially offset by positive show rotation revenue of approximately $6 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Travel Recreation Group segment experiences peak activity during the summer months.
884219_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	During 2013, 83 percent of its revenue was earned in the second and third quarters.
884219_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	Results for the Travel Recreation Group segment for 2013 were affected by exchange rate variances, which had an unfavorable impact on revenue and segment operating income of $2.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Excluding exchange rate variances, revenue increased by $6.6 million, or 6.3 percent, and segment operating income increased by $2.3 million, or 11.4 percent.
884219_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	During 2013, results were negatively impacted by extensive flooding that took place on June 20, 2013, in Alberta, Canada.
884219_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Major pieces of infrastructure in the province were affected and many roads became impassable, which temporarily restricted access to Brewster s hotel properties and attractions in the area.
884219_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The provincial authorities were able to restore road access to Banff for both commercial and private vehicles by June 26, 2013, ahead of the Canada Day holiday weekend.
884219_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	Management started seeing more normalized occupancy and visitor traffic in August.
884219_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	Management estimates that the flooding had an unfavorable impact on 2013 revenue of approximately $2 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Brewster recovered well from the flooding that occurred in late June and delivered solid growth for the full year across nearly all of its lines of business.
884219_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group revenue by line of business:
884219_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The increase in revenue in 2013 was primarily driven by hospitality and attractions.
884219_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The revenue growth from hospitality properties was primarily due to improved results at most of the lodges and hotels.
884219_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Glacier Park saw strong results, particularly at the Grouse Mountain Lodge, which was recently updated and refreshed.
884219_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	In addition, the Banff International Hotel, which was acquired on March 7, 2012, benefited from a full first quarter contribution.
884219_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	The improved results from attractions were primarily due to increased passenger counts at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, the Banff Gondola, and the Banff Lake Cruise.
884219_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators.
884219_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The same-store key performance indicators presented below exclude the metrics for the Banff International Hotel (acquired in March 2012), as well as all of the hospitality properties and the Red Bus Tours attraction that were part of Glacier Park s expired concession contract with the Park Service.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in RevPAR reflects improvement across most properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Grouse Mountain Lodge experienced particularly strong growth in occupancy driven by the Company s renovations in 2012 and 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase in ADR was primarily driven by the Denali Backcountry Lodge, St. Mary Lodge and Resort, and the Glacier Park Lodge.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The Denali Backcountry Lodge experienced stronger bookings than expected in 2013, which allowed management to offer higher rates.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	In addition, the Glacier Park Lodge centennial anniversary in 2013 increased demand for Glacier Park properties, which was matched with higher rates.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	The decrease in room nights available from 2012 to 2013 was due to changes in seasonal opening and closing dates of certain Glacier Park properties.
884219_15_ITEM7_P58_S6	Management schedules opening and closing dates to optimize profitability based on anticipated travel patterns, and forecasted occupancy levels and operating expenses.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The number of passengers increased in 2013 at all three of Brewster attractions (Banff Gondola, Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, and Banff Lake Cruise), despite the flood impact.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in revenue per passenger was mainly driven by increased ticket prices at the Banff Gondola attraction.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	For the 2013 full year, approximately 75 percent of revenue and 88 percent of segment operating income generated in the Travel Recreation Group segment were derived through its Canadian operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	These operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation, and, accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar, as compared to other currencies, could adversely affect customer volumes, revenue and segment operating income for the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_15_ITEM7_P59_S5	Corporate activities expense of $6.8 million in 2013 decreased from $9.4 million in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	These decreases were partially offset by 2013 costs related to the Company s strategic review process.
884219_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	In 2013, Viad recorded net restructuring charges of $3.8 million, as compared to $4.9 million in 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	The 2013 charges primarily related to reorganization activities in the Marketing Events Group, comprised of the elimination of certain positions.
884219_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	In addition, restructuring charges related to the elimination of certain positions in the Travel Recreation Group and at Viad corporate were also recorded in 2013.
884219_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	Viad recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $3.1 million in 2013 related to the non-cash write down of goodwill at the Glacier Park reporting unit of $2.1 million and $1.0 million related to the write-off of certain assets within the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The effective tax rate for 2013 was 30.1 percent, as compared to 84.6 percent for 2012.
884219_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	The high rate for 2012, as compared to the statutory rate, was due to the charge to income tax expense of $13.4 million, representing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards.
884219_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	On December 31, 2013, Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service to operate lodging, tour and transportation and other hospitality services for Glacier National Park expired.

884219_15_ITEM7_P62_S5	During 2014 , the Company generated net cash flows from operating activities of $58.1 million primarily driven by operating results, somewhat offset by changes in working capital.
884219_15_ITEM7_P62_S6	Management believes that Viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_15_ITEM7_P62_S7	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had approximately $40.1 million of its cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States.

884219_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	As of December 31, 2014, Viad was in compliance with all covenants.
884219_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Viad s total debt of $141.0 million consisted of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility of $125.0 million and $14.5 million , respectively, and capital lease obligations of $1.5 million .

884219_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (of which GES and GES Event Intelligence Services, Inc. are guarantors) are indexed to the prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus appropriate spreads tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Commitment fees and letters of credit fees are also tied to Viad s leverage ratio.
884219_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	The fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility are currently 0.35 percent annually.
884219_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Guarantees As of December 31, 2014 , Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by the Company s subsidiary operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2014 would be $5.9 million .
884219_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Share Repurchases Viad has announced the authorization of its Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock on the open market from time to time at prevailing market prices.
884219_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	During 2014 , the Company repurchased 448,436 shares on the open market at a total cost of $10.6 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	No shares were repurchased on the open market during 2013.

884219_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Refer to Note 26 , Subsequent Event , of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table presents Viad s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 :
884219_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	(1) Estimated contributions related to multi-employer benefit plans are excluded from the table above.
884219_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Refer to Note 18 , Pension and Postretirement Benefits , of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding those obligations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	(2) Purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
884219_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	(3) Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $32.1 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	Refer to Note 9 , Other Current Liabilities and Note 10 , Other Deferred Liabilities , of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive or other damages.
884219_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2014 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
884219_15_ITEM7_P83_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , there was a remaining environmental remediation liability of approximately $4.7 million related to previously sold operations of which $ 0.4 million is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Other current liabilities and $ 4.4 million under the caption Other deferred items and liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 totaled $23.2 million , $20.3 million and $20.7 million, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Viad does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
884219_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	See Notes 11 , 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The SEC has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31 of each year.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	For impairment testing purposes, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events U.S. segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level, which represents all domestic operations of GES.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	Furthermore, the goodwill related to the Marketing Events International segment is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S7	For the Marketing Events International segment the reporting units are GES United Kingdom and GES Canada.
884219_15_ITEM7_P87_S8	Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaska Denali Travel are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
884219_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Viad had total goodwill of $194.2 million consisting of $152.8 million related to the Marketing Events Group and $41.4 million related to the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The following table summarizes goodwill balances by reporting unit and segment as of December 31:
884219_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	Furthermore, the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.
884219_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Viad had aggregate goodwill of $194.2 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Furthermore, as a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed as of October 31, 2014 , the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test was 142 percent , 48 percent and 52 percent for each of the Marketing Events Group reporting units in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	For the Brewster, Glacier Park and Alaska Denali Travel reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 167 percent , 16 percent and 14 percent , respectively, as of the most recent impairment test.
884219_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenues, operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment charges.
884219_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	See Results of Operations above and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the goodwill impairment loss recorded during 2013 related to Glacier Park.
884219_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheet.
884219_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	The Company uses significant judgment in forming conclusions regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates all available positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
884219_15_ITEM7_P92_S4	To the extent recovery does not appear likely, a valuation allowance must be recorded.
884219_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $69.2 million and $77.0 million, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	During the third quarter of 2014, the Company released a $10.9 million valuation allowance associated with foreign income tax credits.
884219_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of the foreign tax credits, including recent operating history, future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, utilization history and projected future U.S. taxable income.
884219_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Based on the evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, it was determined to be more likely than not that the foreign tax credits carryforwards would be utilized before their expiration.
884219_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	At the end of 2014, the remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards are $12.7 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P94_S4	If not utilized, the tax credits will begin to expire during 2020.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	While management believes that the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances will be utilized in future periods, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	It is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Such a change could result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	Viad has not recorded deferred taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiaries as management intends to reinvest those earnings in its Canadian operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S4	As of December 31, 2014, the incremental unrecognized tax liability (net of estimated foreign tax credits) related to those undistributed earnings was approximately $350,000.
884219_15_ITEM7_P95_S5	To the extent that circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of those undistributed earnings will be remitted to the U.S., Viad would accrue income taxes attributable to such remittance.
884219_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position.
884219_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	For all tax positions meeting this threshold, Viad recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
884219_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.4 million to its funded pension plans and $0.8 million to its unfunded pension plans in 2015.
884219_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees and dependents.
884219_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $1.1 million to the plans in 2015.
884219_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2014 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5 percent, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2024 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2013 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 8.0 percent, declining one-half percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.8 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
884219_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $2.9 million , $5.2 million and $7.2 million , respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	Furthermore, the total tax benefits related to such costs were $1.1 million , $1.9 million and $2.6 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
884219_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awards are based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals (where applicable) and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price or the Monte Carlo simulation model until the time of settlement.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	The fair value of performance-based awards based on a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of Viad s stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return and an expected term.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility, the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding, the expected dividend yield on Viad s common stock and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S4	While the Company has not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s future results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S5	See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P104_S6	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Viad s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Forward-Looking Statements: As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new or renewal business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.

884219_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	governmental, technological, capital marketplace and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of $12.4 million and $30.8 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	During 2014 and 2013 , unrealized foreign currency translation losses of $18.4 million and $11.3 million , respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenues, expenses, gains and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period-to-period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange rate variances on year-over-year revenue and segment operating results from Viad s international operations, excluding 2014 acquisitions:
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As the Canadian operations generated aggregate operating income in 2014, Viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by $1.1 million from the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As the United Kingdom operations generated aggregate operating income in 2014, Viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by $0.5 million from the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The change in the Euro exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar did not have a meaningful impact on Viad's segment operating income.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $2.6 million.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S4	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $0.9 million, including the results from the acquisition of Blitz that was completed during the third quarter of 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P3_S5	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Euro exchange rate would not have resulted in a meaningful change to operating income, including the results from the acquisition of N200 that was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Periodically, Brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume, by fuel product, to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract, which is generally no longer than one year.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The main objective of Viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins.
884219_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	There were no fuel contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
884219_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Viad, the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures has been evaluated as of December 31, 2014 , and, based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2014 .
884219_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
884219_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
884219_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	In accordance with the SEC's published guidance, our management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Blitz, onPeak and N200, which we acquired on September 16, 2014, October 7, 2014 and November 24, 2014, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 19.3% of total assets and 1.6% of revenues of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.
884219_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

884219_15_ITEM15_P2_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of Viad Corp and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
884219_15_ITEM15_P3_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_15_ITEM15_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_15_ITEM15_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_15_ITEM15_P4_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_15_ITEM15_P4_S2	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_15_ITEM15_P5_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P5_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_15_ITEM15_P6_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_15_ITEM15_P6_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_15_ITEM15_P6_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_15_ITEM15_P7_S0	Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_15_ITEM15_P7_S1	The objective of this assessment was to determine whether Viad s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 .
884219_15_ITEM15_P8_S0	In accordance with the SEC's published guidance, our management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Blitz, onPeak and N200, which we acquired on September 16, 2014, October 7, 2014 and November 24, 2014, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 19.3% of total assets and 1.6% of revenues of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.
884219_15_ITEM15_P8_S1	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014 , Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_15_ITEM15_P8_S2	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this Annual Report.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Blitz, onPeak and N200, which were acquired on September 16, 2014, October 7, 2014 and November 24, 2014, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 19.3% of total assets and 1.6% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Blitz, onPeak and N200.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S3	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_15_ITEM15_P9_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_15_ITEM15_P10_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated March 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends and historical experience.

884219_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	The fair value of an asset or liability is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
884219_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	The fair value guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
884219_15_ITEM15_P128_S2	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value.
884219_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	Viad measures its money market mutual funds and certain other mutual fund investments at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.
884219_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following tables:

884219_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The fair value measurement of the earn-out contingent consideration obligation relates to the acquisition of N200 in November, and is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
884219_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	The fair value measurement is based upon significant inputs not observable in the market.
884219_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	Changes in the value of the obligation are recorded as income or expense in our consolidated statements of income.
884219_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	We estimated the original fair value of the contingent consideration as the present value of the expected contingent payment, determined using the weighted probabilities of the possible payments.
884219_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	We are required to reassess the fair value of the contingent payments on a contingent basis.
884219_15_ITEM15_P133_S2	Significant increases (decreases) in any of those probabilities in isolation may result in a higher (lower) fair value measurement.
884219_15_ITEM15_P133_S3	The significant inputs used in these estimates include numerous possible scenarios for the payments based on the contractual terms of the contingent consideration, for which probabilities are assigned to each scenario, which are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the individual risk analysis of the respective liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in the future may result in different estimated amounts.
884219_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	The contingent payment, if any, will be paid during the third quarter of 2015.
884219_15_ITEM15_P134_S2	A one percentage point change in the discount rates used would not have significantly impacted the current liability as of December 31, 2014.
884219_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

884219_15_ITEM15_P198_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_15_ITEM15_P198_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2014 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position or results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P199_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P199_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_15_ITEM15_P199_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P199_S3	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P199_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Viad had recorded environmental remediation liabilities of $4.7 million and $5.0 million related to previously sold operations, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by Viad s subsidiary operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2014 would be $5.9 million .
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S4	These guarantees relate to leased facilities expiring through October 2017 .
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_15_ITEM15_P200_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and the Company is a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 30 percent of Viad s regular full-time employees are covered by collective-bargaining agreements.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S2	If the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S3	Viad believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2015 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse effect on Viad s operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S4	The Company entered into new showsite and warehouse agreements with the Chicago Teamsters Local 727, effective January 1, 2014, and those agreements contain provisions that allow the parties to re-open negotiation of the agreements on pension-related issues.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S5	The Company is in informal discussions regarding those issues with all relevant parties and is working diligently to resolve those issues in a manner that will be reasonable and equitable to employees, customers and shareholders.
884219_15_ITEM15_P201_S6	Although the Company s labor relations are currently stable, disruptions pending the outcome of the Chicago Teamsters Local 727 negotiations could occur, as they could with any collective-bargaining agreement negotiation, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.
884219_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_15_ITEM15_P202_S1	Viad s contributions to these plans in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 totaled $23.2 million , $20.3 million and $20.7 million , respectively.
884219_15_ITEM15_P202_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_15_ITEM15_P203_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM15_P203_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_15_ITEM15_P204_S0	Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, employee health benefits, automobile, product and general liability and property loss claims.
884219_15_ITEM15_P204_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to the Company s retention limit) related to Viad s continuing operations was approximately $19.9 million as of December 31, 2014.
884219_15_ITEM15_P204_S2	Of this total, $12.4 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $7.5 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling $4.5 million as of December 31, 2014, related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM15_P205_S1	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency and other factors.
884219_15_ITEM15_P205_S2	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $0.2 million to $0.4 million on a per claim basis.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $4.8 million , $6.6 million and $5.6 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S3	In addition, as of December 31, 2014 Viad had recorded insurance liabilities of $7.7 million related to continuing operations in excess of the self-insured levels for which Viad remains the primary obligor.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S4	Of this total, $3.1 million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining $4.6 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_15_ITEM15_P206_S5	The Company has recorded those amounts in other deferred items and liabilities in Viad s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding receivable in other investments and assets.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	Segment Information Viad measures profit and performance of its operations on the basis of segment operating income which excludes restructuring charges and recoveries and impairment charges and recoveries.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S1	Intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and intersegment transfers are not significant.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S2	Corporate activities include expenses not allocated to operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S3	Depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense are the only significant non-cash items for the reportable segments.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S4	No reportable segment has a single client comprising more than 6.3 percent of that segment s revenues, and no single client comprises more than 4.2 percent of Viad s revenues.
884219_15_ITEM15_P207_S5	Disclosures regarding Viad s reportable segments with reconciliations to consolidated totals are as follows:
884219_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	Viad s foreign operations are located principally in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.
884219_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	Marketing Events Group revenues are designated as domestic or foreign based on the originating location of the product or service.
884219_15_ITEM15_P209_S1	Long-lived assets are attributed to domestic or foreign based principally on the physical location of the assets.

884219_15_ITEM15_P209_S3	The table below presents the financial information by major geographic area:

884219_15_ITEM15_P212_S1	The Company s 2013 and 2012 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business have been reclassified as discontinued operations in Viad s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
884219_15_ITEM15_P212_S2	For the years ended 2013 and 2012, Viad recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.2 million and $2.4 million related to Glacier Park income.
884219_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	On December 31, 2013, Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service to operate lodging, tour and transportation and other hospitality services within Glacier National Park expired.
884219_15_ITEM15_P213_S1	Upon completion of the contract, the Company received cash payments in January 2014 totaling $25.0 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $21.5 million for the Company s possessory interest.
884219_15_ITEM15_P213_S2	The gain after-tax on the possessory interest was $13.5 million with $2.7 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest.
884219_15_ITEM15_P213_S3	These amounts are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in Viad s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively.

884219_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses, or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Acquisitions can involve a number of risks, including the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; increased debt; new regulatory requirements; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If Viad makes changes to its business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect its business operations, the Company may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Viad s businesses and results of operations are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Viad s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by changes in the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The results of operations for the U.S. Segment and the International Segment depends largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the results of operations for the Marketing Events Group are adversely affected.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Revenue from the Travel Recreation Group depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Viad s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Viad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of those foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	During 2015, the Marketing Events Group derived approximately 28 percent of its revenue and 46 percent of its segment operating income from its International Segment.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Travel Recreation Group derived approximately 73 percent of its 2015 revenue and 89 percent of its 2015 segment operating income from its Canadian operations, which are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar, relative to other currencies, could affect customer volumes and the results of operations in the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Show rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The business activities of the Marketing Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	different time of year than when previously held .
884219_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in differ ent years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The factors described above may cause the results of operat ions for those businesses to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees, or others, to travel.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents, and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from exhibition facilities could adversely impact revenue.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Although no single client accounted for more than 6.3 percent of Viad s consolidated revenue in 2015, the U.S. Segment and the International Segment have a relatively small number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Consistent with industry practice, and only after a favorable review of credit worthiness, some of those larger clients have also been granted extended payment terms.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	The loss of any of these large clients, or the failure of such clients to pay in accordance with any extended payment terms, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the U.S Segment and the International Segment.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	In addition, revenue of the Marketing Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing, or other services.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P9_S10	When the Marketing Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the event organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform those electrical and plumbing services, subject to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As a result, some of those facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of those services.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing Events Group has those relationships choose to in-source those services, such a decision could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The business activities of the U.S. Segment and the International Segment are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Those relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take those customers to a competitor.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Viad s future payment of special dividends should not be relied upon as a way to realize any future gains on an investment.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The Board of Directors generally declares and pays regular dividends to Viad s shareholders on a quarterly basis and also has paid special dividends, most recently in February 2014.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The decision to declare a special dividend and the amount, timing, and payment of any such dividend are at the sole discretion of the Board.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Factors in any decision to declare a dividend would include the amount of funds legally available and an evaluation of the Company s financial condition, capital requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Accordingly, investors should not rely on the future payment of special dividends as a way to realize gains on their investment.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Exhibition and event activity for the U.S. Segment and the International Segment varies significantly depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Travel Recreation Group experiences peak activity during the summer months.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	During 2015, 87 percent of the Travel Recreation Group s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	From time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance , and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Capital projects are subject to a number of r isks, including unanticipated delays , cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals , as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital pr oject from performing in accordance with Viad s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The U.S. Segment and the International Segment rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities, and customer facilities.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If Viad s customers and suppliers were unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts, or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on the businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Either event could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Additionally, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans, to which Viad contributes, may have an adverse impact on its results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Viad s contributions to those multi-employer plans in 2015 and 2014 totaled $22.0 million and $23.2 million, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Viad does not directly manage those multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to those plans.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have a material adverse effect on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Refer to Note 18 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact its results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Competition in the Live Events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting it results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Viad s inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food , and fresh meats.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Some of those businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environment al Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or thei r subsidiaries.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, future events or proceedings could contradict with current assumptions, which could cause reserves or insurance to b ecome inadequate and, ultimately, have a material adverse e ffect on Viad s results of operations .
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad s business.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such catastrophic events could impact the Marketing Events Group s production facilities, preventing the Company from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and could also cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Such catastrophic events could also adversely impact the Travel Recreation Group businesses, which are heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The guests serviced by the Travel Recreation Group tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions during a given season, and catastrophic events could impede the guests ability to travel, interrupt the Company s business operations, and/or cause damage to the Company s properties.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations and financial condition.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm the Company s reputation.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Viad s businesses store and process a significant amount of personally identifiable information in connection with the services they provide to customers.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If the Company s security controls over personal data, training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices and procedures do not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, the Company s reputation could be harmed, and the Company could face legal exposure to customers and other liabilities under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Certain of the Company s services also enable its customers to store and process personal data.
884219_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Perceptions that the Company s services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The U.S. Segment operates 20 offices and 25 multi-use facilities (manufacturing, sales and design, office, storage and/or warehouse, and truck marshaling yards).
884219_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 677,800 square feet.

884219_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	Effective February 24, 2016, Viad executed an amendment (the Credit Agreement Amendment ) to its $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ).
884219_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	The terms of the Credit Agreement allowed Viad to make dividends, distributions, and repurchases with respect to the Company s common stock in an amount of up to $20 million per calendar year, but restricted Viad from making any further stock dividends, distributions, or repurchases above such an amount unless the Company s leverage ratio was less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00, no default or unmatured default, as defined in the Credit Agreement, existed, and the liquidity amount (defined as cash in the U.S. and Canada, plus available revolver borrowings on a pro forma basis) was at least $100 million.

884219_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Viad is an international experiential services company with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates.
884219_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Viad is committed to providing best in class experiences to its clients, customers, and guests by offering products and services designed to meet their current and future needs.
884219_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Viad operates through three reportable business segments: the Marketing Events U.S. Segment (the U.S. Segment ), the Marketing Events International Segment (the International Segment ) (collectively, the Marketing Events Group ), and the Travel Recreation Group.
884219_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Marketing Events Group, comprised of Global Experience Specialists, Inc. and affiliates ( GES ), is a global, full-service provider for live events.
884219_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	GES uniquely combines the art of high-impact creativity, service, and expertise with the science of easy-to-use technology, strategy, and worldwide logistics to help clients gain a greater return at their events and enhance the exhibitor experience.
884219_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Travel Recreation Group provides experiential travel services in iconic locations which enjoy perennial demand.
884219_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Travel Recreation Group offers guests distinctive and world renowned experiences through its collection of unique hotels, lodges, recreational attractions, and transportation services.
884219_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	The Company remains focused on building powerful new experiences and enhancing a unique portfolio of integrated tourism assets.
884219_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Non-GAAP Measures In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the Company also discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures:
884219_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before the Company s portion of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income attributable to Viad.
884219_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined by Viad as segment operating income before non-cash depreciation and amortization and integration costs, if any.
884219_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Segment operating income is a GAAP measure defined as income from continuing operations before corporate activities, interest expense and interest income, income taxes, restructuring charges, impairment losses and recoveries, and the reduction for income attributable to non-controlling interest.
884219_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Adjusted Segment EBITDA is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operating segments and acquisitions to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	For a discussion of how this metric is used in connection with 2016 full year acquisition performance expectations, refer to the Forward Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD A. Management believes that Adjusted Segment EBITDA for acquisitions enables investors to assess how effectively management is investing capital into major corporate development projects, both from a valuation and return perspective.
884219_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating income are defined by Viad as revenue and segment operating income, respectively, without the impact of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods.
884219_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The impact of exchange rate variances is calculated as the difference between current period activity translated at the current period s exchange rates and the comparable prior period s exchange rates.
884219_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Management believes that the presentation of organic results permits investors to better understand Viad s performance without the effects of exchange rate variances or acquisitions.
884219_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for reconciliations of organic revenue and organic segment operating income to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, revenue and segment operating income.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Management believes that the presentatio n of Adjusted EBIT DA, Adjusted S egment EBITDA, organic revenue, and organic segment operating income (collectively, t he Non-GAAP Measures ) provide s useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing, and benchmarking the perform ance and value of Viad s bus iness.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures is supplemental to results presented under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measure s used by other companies.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in addit ion to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Non-GAAP Measures are considered useful operating metrics as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation and amortization, debt service costs, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in additional measures considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations and segment performance.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	Although the Non-GAAP Measures are used as financial measures to assess the performance of the business, the use of these measures is limited because these measures do not consider material costs, expenses, and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment charges or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	Since the Non-GAAP Measures do not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad and organic segment operating income as important measures of financial performance because both provide a more complete measure of the Company s performance.
884219_16_ITEM7_P10_S7	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to lower corporate costs, offset in part by higher restructuring charges.
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Adjusted EBITDA increased $14.8 million in 2014 primarily due to higher segment operating income at both the Marketing Events Group and Travel Recreation Group and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by higher corporate costs.
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has also provided Adjusted Segment EBITDA, formerly referred to as segment EBITDA, as a forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure within the Results of Operations section of this MD A. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible, not all of the information necessary for quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts.
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Consequently, any attempt to disclose such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.
884219_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	It is probable that the forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure provided without the directly comparable GAAP financial measure may be materially different from the corresponding Non-GAAP Measure.
884219_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Total revenue increased $24.1 million or 2.3 percent, primarily due to incremental revenue from the acquisitions of onPeak, Blitz, N200, and the West Glacier Properties of $49.1 million, U.S. base same-show revenue growth of 8 percent, and new business wins in the Marketing Events Group as well as revenue growth in attractions in the Travel Recreation Group, offset in part by negative show rotation of approximately $71 million and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $39.7 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue derived from shows that the Company produced out of the same city during the same quarter in each year.
884219_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total segment operating income decreased $5.3 million or 8.8 percent, primarily due to higher performance-based incentives, non-cash depreciation and amortization from acquisitions completed in 2014 of $7.3 million, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.7 million, offset in part by flow through from higher revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Viad decreased $12.0 million due to the income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service.
884219_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net income attributable to Viad decreased $25.7 million or 49.2 percent, primarily due to decreased segment operating income, the discontinued operations income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service, and the $11.7 million reversal of a valuation allowance in 2014 in connection with the Company s analysis of its deferred tax assets.
884219_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total revenue increased $111.6 million or 11.7 percent, primarily due to positive show rotation of approximately $69 million, U.S. base same-show revenue growth of 6.4 percent, and incremental revenue from the acquisitions of onPeak, Blitz, N200, and the West Glacier Properties of $21.3 million, as well as revenue growth in attractions in the Travel Recreation Group largely due to the Glacier Skywalk (opened May 2014).
884219_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Total segment operating income increased $18.0 million or 42.8 percent, primarily due to flow through from higher revenue and increased margins in all three reportable segments.
884219_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income from discontinued operations attributable to Viad increased $9.4 million due to the income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service on December 31, 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company s 2013 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business were reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net income attributable to Viad increased $30.8 million primarily due to an $11.7 million reversal of a valuation allowance in 2014 in connection with the Company s analysis of its deferred tax assets, income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service, and increased segment operating income.
884219_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Variances Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The following tables summarize the effects of foreign exchange rate variances on revenue and segment operating results (or FX Impact ) from Viad s significant international operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, excluding the effect of 2014 acquisitions:
884219_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Viad s 2015 operating results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Viad s 2014 operating results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the strengthening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Analysis of Operating Results by Reportable Segment Marketing Events Group 2015 compared with 2014 The following table provides a comparison of the Marketing Events Group s reported operating results to organic operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in order to better understand the underlying performance of the segment without the effects of acquisitions or FX Impact.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	(1) Acquisitions for the U.S Segment include onPeak (acquired in October 2014).
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Acquisitions for the International Segment include Blitz (acquired in September 2014) and N200 (acquired in November 2014).
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	(2) Organic operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	For more information about organic operating results, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. U.S. Segment U.S. Segment revenue increased $10.0 million or 1.4 percent, primarily due to incremental revenue of $24.8 million from the acquisition of onPeak, base same-show revenue growth of 8.0 percent, new business wins, and increased sales to corporate clients, offset in part by negative show rotation of approximately $75 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Base same-shows represented 44.7 percent of the 2015 U.S. Segment organic revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	Organic revenue decreased $14.7 million or 2.1 percent.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	U.S. Segment operating income decreased $6.8 million or 31.9 percent, primarily due to negative show rotation revenue and higher performance-based incentives, offset in part by incremental segment operating income of $6.7 million from the acquisition of onPeak.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S7	Organic operating income decreased $13.5 million or 62.4 percent.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S8	International Segment International Segment revenue increased $23.0 million or 9.2 percent, primarily driven by incremental revenue of $23.5 million from the acquisitions of Blitz and N200, new business wins, increased client spending, and positive show rotation revenue of approximately $4 million, offset in part by an unfavorable FX Impact of $26.0 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P24_S9	Organic revenue increased $25.5 million or 10.7 percent.
884219_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	International Segment operating income increased $1.9 million or 18.1 percent , primarily due to higher organic revenue and incremental segment operating income from the acquisitions of Blitz and N200 of $0.9 million, offset in part by higher performance-based incentives and an unfavorable FX Impact of $1.0 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Organic operating income increased $2.0 million or 19.4 percent.
884219_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Although the Marketing Events Group has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenue is affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest growth.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	For the 2016 full year, management expects the Marketing Events Group s revenue to be up high-single digits from 2015 driven by positive show rotation of approximately $50 million to $55 million, new business wins, and continued same-show growth, partially offset by an unfavorable FX Impact.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Management anticipates an unfavorable FX Impact on the Marketing Events Group s 2016 full year revenue and segment operating income of approximately $17 million and $1 million, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Management expects U.S. base same-show revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	Management is executing a strategic growth plan to position the Marketing Events Group as the preferred, global full-service provider of live events, with further reach to exhibitions, congresses and conferences, corporate events, and consumer events.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	In support of this strategy, the Company acquired Blitz, onPeak, and N200 during 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S6	The Company continues to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses with proven products and services that complement, enhance, or expand the current business or offer growth opportunities to create the most comprehensive suite of services for the Live Events industry.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S7	Additionally, management remains focused on improving the profitability of the U.S. Segment through continued efforts to more effectively manage labor costs by driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning that reduces the ratio of labor costs to revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P27_S8	Improving this metric is a top priority of management and the Company continues to develop and enhance tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement and benchmarking.
884219_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	2014 compared with 2013 The following table provides a comparison of the Marketing Events Group s reported operating results to organic operating results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 in order to better understand the underlying performance of the segment without the effects of acquisitions or FX Impact.

884219_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	For more information about organic operating results, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. U.S. Segment U.S Segment revenue increased $82.0 million or 13.0 percent, primarily due to positive show rotation revenue of approximately $69 million, base same-show revenue growth of 6.4 percent, incremental revenue of $6.1 million from the acquisition of onPeak, and higher revenue from corporate clients, offset in part by the loss of the International Consumer Electronics Show.
884219_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	Base same-shows represented approximately 39 percent of the 2014 U.S. Segment revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P29_S5	Organic revenue increased $75.9 million or 12.1 percent.
884219_16_ITEM7_P29_S6	U.S. Segment operating income increased $10.4 million or 94.1 percent, primarily due to higher organic revenue, offset in part by a non-recurring gain of $4.8 million in 2013 related to the sale of a facility and higher performance-based incentives in 2014.

884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	(2) Organic operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	For more information about organic operating results, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. Travel Recreation Group revenue decreased $8.3 million or 6.9 percent, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $13.7 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	Organic revenue increased $4.5 million or 3.9 percent, primarily due to higher effective ticket prices at the attractions and an increase in the number of passengers at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure .
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	Travel Recreation Group operating income decreased $0.3 million or 1.1 percent, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $4.6 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Organic operating income increased $4.3 million or 16.1 percent, primarily driven by increased attractions revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	2016 Outlook Management expects the Travel Recreation Group s revenue to be down low-single digits from 2015 due to changes in Brewster s package tours and transportation lines of business, which are expected to impact revenue by approximately $7 million to $9 million as management streamlines those operations to focus on higher return opportunities, an unfavorable FX Impact, and renovation closures at the Banff Gondola which are expected to decrease revenue by approximately $1 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S7	Management anticipates an unfavorable FX Impact on the Travel Recreation Group s 2016 full year revenue and segment operating income of approximately $8 million and $2 million, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P31_S8	Management expects the January 2016 acquisition of Maligne Tours Ltd.

884219_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	2014 compared with 201 3 The following table provides a comparison of the Travel Recreation Group s reported operating results to organic operating results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 in order to better understand the underlying performance of the segment without the effects of acquisitions or FX Impact.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	(1) Acquisitions include the West Glacier Properties (acquired in July 2014).
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	(2) Organic operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	For more information about organic operating results, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. Travel Recreation Group revenue increased $12.1 million or 11.1 percent, primarily driven by attractions and incremental revenue of $4.6 million from the West Glacier Properties acquisition, offset in part by an unfavorable FX Impact of $4.7 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Organic revenue increased $12.2 million or 11.2 percent, primarily due to the opening of the Glacier Skywalk attraction and increased passenger counts at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, the Banff Gondola, and the Banff Lake Cruise.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Hospitality revenue increased slightly primarily due to increases at the Banff International Hotel, the Mount Royal Hotel, and the Glacier View Inn, which benefitted from strong visitation to Banff and Jasper National Parks, as well as Grouse Mountain Lodge driven by the Company s renovations in 2012 and 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S5	The increases at these properties were offset in part by decreased revenue at the Denali Backcountry Lodge due to flooding at the end of June 2014 and at Glacier Park Lodge which experienced especially strong occupancy in 2013 as a result of its centennial anniversary.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S6	Transportation revenue decreased primarily due to reduced business for the Denali Backcountry Adventure.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S7	Package tours revenue increased primarily due to higher group and individual business.
884219_16_ITEM7_P33_S8	Travel Recreation Group operating income increased $6.3 million or 28.9 percent, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by an unfavorable FX Impact of $0.9 million.

884219_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Performance Measures Management uses the following key business metrics to evaluate the Travel Recreation Group hospitality business: revenue per available room ( RevPAR ), average daily rate ( ADR ), and occupancy.
884219_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	These metrics are commonly used in the hospitality industry to measure performance.
884219_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue for comparable hospitality properties.
884219_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability.
884219_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to generate.
884219_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Increases in ADR at hospitality properties lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on marg ins than increases in occupancy.
884219_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Travel Recreation Group hospitality properties during the period.
884219_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties.
884219_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), as well as increased ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).
884219_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Management evaluates the performance of the Travel Recreation Group attractions business utilizing the number of passengers and total attractions revenue per passenger.
884219_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The number of passengers allows management to assess the volume of visitor activity at each attraction during the period.
884219_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Total attractions revenue per passenger is calculated as total attractions revenue divided by the total number of passengers at all Travel Recreation Group attractions during the period.
884219_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	Total attractions revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	Total attractions revenue per passenger measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business.
884219_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	2015 compared with 2014 The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	For Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	(1) The Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the West Glacier Properties (acquired in July 2014), as it was not included in the entirety of 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Room nights available were relatively flat in 2015.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The slight increase was due to additional room nights available from the Denali Cabins due to its opening ten days earlier than the prior year as a result of management s review of a variety of factors, including the weather conditions, opening dates of other properties in the area, and availability of seasonal employees.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Additionally, the Grouse Mountain Lodge added one guest room in 2015, offset in part by St. Mary Lodge closing eight days earlier than the prior year due to the Going-to-the-Sun Road closure for construction.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	RevPAR increased in 2015 primarily driven by the Alaska Denali Travel and Brewster properties, offset in part by decreases at certain Glacier Park properties (Glacier Park Lodge, St. Mary Lodge, and Grouse Mountain Lodge) as a result of forest fires during the third quarter of 2015.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	ADR increased for the Alaska Denali Travel and Brewster properties due to higher room rates charged.
884219_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	Occupancy decreased in 2015 primarily due to forest fires that affected certain Glacier Park properties and decreases at the Banff International Hotel due to planned room renovation activity, offset in part by the Denali Backcountry Lodge which experienced a strong increase in occupancy in 2015 due to flooding in June 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Revenue per passenger increased primarily due to higher effective ticket prices.
884219_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The number of passengers de creased during 2015 at the Glacier Skywalk , which is attributed to widespread marketing efforts and a strong opening in 2014 , and at th e Banff Gondola due to the closure in October 2015 as part of the redevelopment project .
884219_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Th e decrease in the number of passengers was offset in part by an increase in the number of passengers at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure .
884219_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Excluding the Banff Gondola fourth quarter passengers, total attraction passengers would have increased 2.4 percent in 2015.
884219_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	2014 compared with 2013 The following table provides Travel Recreation Group same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	For Travel Recreation Group properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	(1) The Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the West Glacier Properties (acquired in July 2014) and the Glacier Skywalk attraction (opened May 2014), as they were not included in 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in RevPAR in 2014 was primarily due to higher occupancy and ADR at the Mount Royal Hotel, the Banff International Hotel, and the Glacier View Inn driven by increased visitation to Banff and Jasper National Parks.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Grouse Mountain Lodge also experienced higher RevPAR driven by the Company s renovations in 2012 and 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	These increases were partially offset by reduced occupancy at the Denali Backcountry Lodge, which experienced flooding early in its operating season, and at Glacier Park Lodge, which experienced especially strong occupancy in 2013 as a result of its centennial anniversary.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The decrease in ADR was primarily driven by offering lower rates at the Prince of Wales Hotel in response to softer demand as compared to prior year and higher occupancy during the off-peak season at the Grouse Mountain Lodge when rates were lower.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	The decrease in room nights available from 2013 to 2014 was due to changes in seasonal opening and closing dates of certain Glacier Park properties.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	Management schedules opening and closing dates to optimize profitability based on anticipated travel patterns, and forecasted occupancy levels and operating expenses.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S7	The number of passengers increased in 2014 at all three comparable attractions (Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure, Banff Gondola, and Banff Lake Cruise).
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S8	The attractions benefited from increased park visitation traffic, favorable weather conditions, and strong combination ticket sales with the Glacier Skywalk.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S9	The Banff Lake Cruise experienced a substantial increase in individual traffic as a result of implementing additional departure times in 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S10	During 2015 and 2014, the Travel Recreation Group derived approximately 73 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of revenue and 89 percent and 90 percent, respectively, of segment operating income from its Canadian operations, which are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S11	Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar, relative to other currencies, could affect customer volumes and the results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P46_S12	Additionally, the Travel Recreation Group is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	2015 compared with 2014 Corporate activities expense decreased $4.6 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily related to consulting and other transaction-related costs associated with acquisitions incurred primarily during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and CEO transition costs of $2.7 million incurred during the fourth quarter of 2014, offset in part by costs related to a shareholder nomination and settlement agreement in 2015.
884219_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	2014 compared with 2013 Corporate activities expense increased $7.6 million during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily related to acquisition transaction-related costs of $4.2 million, CEO transition costs of $2.7 million, and higher 401(k) employer matching contributions expense due to the depletion of the Company s common stock held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company s 401(k).
884219_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Matching contributions are now funded from shares of Viad common stock held in treasury which have a higher cost to the Company.
884219_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	2015 compared with 2014 Interest expense increased $2.5 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances resulting from acquisitions completed during the second half of 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	2014 compared with 2013 Interest expense increased $0.8 million during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances resulting from acquisitions completed during the second half of 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	2015 compared with 2014 During 2015, Viad recorded restructuring charges of $3.0 million ($1.9 million after-tax) primarily related to the elimination of positions and facility consolidations in the Marketing Events Group, as well as the elimination of certain positions at the Corporate office and the Travel Recreation Group.

884219_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	The effective tax rate in 2015 included a $1.6 million non-cash tax benefit related to deferred taxes associated with certain foreign intangibles.
884219_16_ITEM7_P51_S5	The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit and state NOL carryforwards.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Discontinued Operations On December 31, 2013, Glacier Park s concession contract with the Park Service to operate lodging, tour and transportation and other hospitality services for Glacier National Park expired.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Upon completion of the contract term, Viad received cash payments in January 2014 of $25.0 million for the Company s possessory interest.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $21.5 million and an after-tax gain of $13.5 million which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, 2014 income from discontinued operations included approximately $0.7 million, net of tax, related to the gain on sale of personal property at Glacier Park, as well as an insurance recovery of $0.3 million, net of tax.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	During 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, net of tax, due to additional reserves related to certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	The Company s 2013 results related to the operations of Glacier Park s concession contract business have been reclassified as discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P52_S6	Accordingly, for the 2013 full year, approximately $19 million in revenue and $4 million in operating income have been reclassified to discontinued operations.

884219_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	There are certain earnings related t o the Company s Canadian operations that have historically been deemed permanently reinvested.
884219_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the incremental tax associated with these earnings, if the cash balances were repatriated to the United States , would approximate $ 2.3 million .
884219_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	2015 compared with 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.2 million in 2015, primarily due to changes in working capital.
884219_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	2014 compared with 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $52.0 million in 2014, primarily due to higher net income and favorable working capital mainly reflecting the volume and timing of revenue in the Marketing Events Group.
884219_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	2015 compared with 2014 Net cash used in investing activities decreased $91.8 million in 2015, primarily due to the cash payments of $120.3 million for the acquisitions of Blitz, onPeak, N200, and the West Glacier Properties in 2014, offset in part by $28.0 million received in 2014 for the Company s possessory interest and personal property at Glacier Park.

884219_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
884219_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $30.7 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.

884219_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Additionally, Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	Refer to Note 21 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Viad has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
884219_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations, Note 20 Leases and Other, and Note 21 - Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Viad s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
884219_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
884219_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components, and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	For the Marketing Events U.S. Segment, goodwill is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level ( all domestic operations of GES ) .
884219_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	For the M a rketing Events International S egment , goodwill is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations ( GES EMEA and GES Canada ) .
884219_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	For the Travel Recreation Group, impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level ( Brewster, Alaska Denali Travel , and Glacier Park ) .
884219_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties, and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2015, Viad s aggregate goodwill was $185.2 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	As a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed as of October 31, 2015, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test for each of the Marketing Events Group s reporting units in the U.S., GES EMEA, and GES Canada, was 146 percent, 132 percent, and 91 percent, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	For the Brewster, Alaska Denali Travel, and Glacier Park reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 146 percent, 48 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenue, operating income, or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in a reporting unit s cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment charges.
884219_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheet.
884219_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	The Company uses significant judgment in forming conclusions regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates all available positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
884219_16_ITEM7_P76_S4	To the extent recovery does not appear likely, a valuation allowance must be recorded.
884219_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $64.6 million and $69.2 million, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	During the third quarter of 2014, the Company released a $10.1 million valuation allowance associated with foreign income tax credits.
884219_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of the foreign tax credits, including recent operating history, future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, utilization history, and projected future U.S. taxable income.
884219_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	Based on the evaluation of all positive and negative evidence, it was determined to be more-likely-than-not that the foreign tax credits carryforwards would be utilized before their expiration.
884219_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	At the end of 2015, the remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards are $9.2 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	If not utilized, the tax credits will begin to expire during 2020.
884219_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	While management believes that the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances, will be utilized in future periods, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets.
884219_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	It is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Such a change could result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	Viad has not recorded deferred taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of its subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands as management intends to reinvest those earnings in its operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P79_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the incremental unrecognized tax liability (net of estimated foreign tax credits) related to those undistributed earnings was approximately $3.4 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	some or all of those undistributed earnings will be remitted to the U.S., Viad would accrue income taxes attributable to such remittance.
884219_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which a determination is first made as to whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position.
884219_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	For all tax positions meeting this threshold, Viad recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
884219_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $0.9 million to its funded pension plans and $0.8 million to its unfunded pension plans in 2016.
884219_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees, and dependents.
884219_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $1.1 million to the plans in 2016.
884219_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2015 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.0 percent, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by the year 2025 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2014 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5 percent, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 5.0 percent by the year 2025 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 by approximately $1.5 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 by approximately $1.3 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	Refer to Note 18 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors, and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards; and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $3.8 million, $2.9 million, and $5.2 million, respectively, and the total tax benefits related to such costs were $1.5 million, $1.1 million, and $1.9 million respectively.
884219_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2015, 2014, or 2013.
884219_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, where applicable, and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price, or the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of Viad s stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.
884219_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	These assumptions include Viad s expected stock price volatility, the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding, the expected dividend yield on Viad s common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	While the Company has not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions of any future grants could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s future results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	Refer to Note 2 Share-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Impact of R ecent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Forward-Looking Statements As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions, and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new or renewal business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates, and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Among other things, natural disasters, gains and losses of customers, consumer demand patterns, labor relations, purchasing decisions related to customer demand for exhibition and event services, existing and new competition, industry alliances, consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which Viad competes, acquisitions, capital allocations, adverse developments in liabilities associated with discontinued operations, and any deterioration in the economy and other risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, included in this Annual Report, may individually or in combination impact future results.
884219_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere, economic, competitive, governmental, technological, capital marketplace, and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis, and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses recorded in stockholders equity of $23.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and gains of $12.4 million as of December 31, 2014.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	During 2015 and 2014, unrealized foreign currency translation losses of $35.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The following table summarizes the FX Impact on revenue and segment operating results from Viad s significant international operations fo r 2015 and 2014 , excluding the effect of 2014 acquisitions:
884219_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Viad s 2015 operating results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Canadian dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $2.7 million.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $0.7 million.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Euro exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $0.3 million.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Viad did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
884219_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, are provided in this Annual Report immediately prior to the Index to Financia l Statements.

884219_16_ITEM15_P1_S0	SIGNAT URES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 11, 2016.
884219_16_ITEM15_P2_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of Viad Corp and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
884219_16_ITEM15_P3_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_16_ITEM15_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_16_ITEM15_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P5_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P6_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_16_ITEM15_P7_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_16_ITEM15_P7_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	The objective of this assessment was to determine whether Viad s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
884219_16_ITEM15_P8_S2	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_16_ITEM15_P8_S3	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this Annual Report.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	R EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_16_ITEM15_P9_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_16_ITEM15_P10_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated March 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Travel Recreation Group is composed of four lines of business: (i) Hospitality; (ii) Attractions; (iii) Package Tours; and (iv) Transportation.
884219_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	These four lines of business work together, driving economies of scope and meaningful scale in and around the iconic destinations of Banff, Jasper and Waterton Lakes National Parks in Canada, and Glacier and Denali National Parks in the United States.
884219_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Travel Recreation Group is composed of Brewster Inc. ( Brewster ), Glacier Park, Inc. ( Glacier Park ), and Alaskan Park Properties, Inc. ( Alaska Denali Travel ).
884219_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
884219_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of Viad s reporting units used to perform annual impairment testing of recorded goodwill; allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable; provisions for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions; valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets; liabilities for losses related to self-insured liability claims; liabilities for losses related to environmental remediation obligations; sublease income associated with restructuring liabilities; assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations; assumptions used to determine share-based compensation costs under the fair value method; and allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_16_ITEM15_P21_S2	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Viad considers all highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
884219_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	Viad s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank demand deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_16_ITEM15_P22_S2	The Company s investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Viad maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.
884219_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	The allowances for doubtful accounts, including a sales allowance for discounts at the time of sale, is based upon an evaluation of the aging of receivables, historical trends, and the current economic environment.
884219_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Inventories Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies, as well as deferred show costs, including labor, show purchases, and commissions used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or market.
884219_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_16_ITEM15_P24_S3	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Capitalized Software Viad capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software.
884219_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training, and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_16_ITEM15_P25_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_16_ITEM15_P25_S4	These costs are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Viad has Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash the Company could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_16_ITEM15_P27_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in the consolidated statements of operations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Self-Insurance Liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss, and medical claims.
884219_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	Viad has also retained certain liabilities related to workers compensation and general liability insurance claims in conjunction with previously sold operations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P28_S2	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s prior historical experience, claims frequency, insurance coverage, and other factors.
884219_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels.
884219_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Enviro nmental Remediation Liabilities Viad has retained certain liabilities representing the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations primarily associated with previously sold operations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	The amounts accrued primarily consist of the estimated direct incremental costs, on an undiscounted basis, for contractor and other services related to remedial actions and post-remediation site monitoring.
884219_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when the specific obligation is considered probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
884219_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Subsequent recoveries from third parties, if any, are recorded through discontinued operations when realized.
884219_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company maintains environmental insurance that provides coverage for new and undiscovered pre-existing conditions at both its continuing and discontinued operations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for the estimated fair value of debt obligations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Foreign Currency Translation Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Revenue Recognition Viad recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
884219_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	GES derives revenue primarily by providing show services to exhibitors participating in exhibitions and events and from the design, construction, and refurbishment of exhibit booths.
884219_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	Service revenue is recognized at the time services are completed.
884219_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	Service revenue from event accommodations services is recorded when services are completed and is net of commissions.
884219_16_ITEM15_P36_S3	Exhibits and environments revenue is accounted for using the completed-contract method.
884219_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Travel Recreation Group generates revenue through its attractions, hotels, transportation, and sightseeing services.
884219_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	Revenue is recognized at the time services are performed.
884219_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Share-Based Compensation Viad recognizes and measures compensation costs related to all share-based payment awards using the fair value method of accounting.
884219_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	These awards generally include restricted stock, stock options, and liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units).
884219_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	These awards contain forfeiture and non-compete provisions.
884219_16_ITEM15_P38_S3	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Viad issues restricted stock awards from shares held in treasury.
884219_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Future vesting of restricted stock is generally subject to continued employment with Viad or its subsidiaries.
884219_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Holders of restricted stock have the right to receive dividends and vote the shares, but may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber the stock, except to the extent restrictions have lapsed.
884219_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Restricted stock awards vest between three and five years from the date of grant.
884219_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately three years except for certain awards with a five-year vesting period whereby expense is recognized based on an accelerated multiple-award approach over a five-year period.
884219_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	For these awards, 40 percent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant and the remaining shares vest in 30 percent increments over the subsequent two anniversary dates.
884219_16_ITEM15_P40_S4	Liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, where applicable, and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price, or the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of Viad s stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.
884219_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Compensation expense rel ated to liability-based awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
884219_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	Share-based compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately five years.
884219_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	The exercise price of stock options is based on the market value of Viad s common stock at the date of grant.
884219_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Common Stock in Treasury Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at historical cost.
884219_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	Subsequent share reissuances are primarily related to share-based compensation programs and recorded at weighted-average cost.
884219_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Income Per Common Share Viad applies the two-class method in calculating income per common share as unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.
884219_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	Accordingly, such securities are included in the earnings allocation in calculating income per share.
884219_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Historically, Viad has funded its matching contributions to employees 401(k) accounts through the Company s leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) feature of the Company s 401(k) defined contribution plan.
884219_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	ESOP shares are treated as outstanding for income per share calculations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	During 2014, the Company depleted these shares and matching contributions are now funded from shares of Viad common stock held in treasury.
884219_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronou ncements The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements:
884219_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	The standard establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
884219_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	The Company may adopt either retrospectively to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients or with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures.
884219_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations, including the method of adoption to be used.
884219_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
884219_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.
884219_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad's consolidated financial statements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The amendments requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
884219_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	For line-of-credit arrangements, an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement.
884219_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad's consolidated financial statements or financial covenants.
884219_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The amendments apply to inventory measures using first-in, first-out or average cost and will require entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
884219_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, minus the cost of completion, disposal and transportation.
884219_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	Replacement cost and net realizable value less a normal profit margin will no longer be considered.
884219_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad's consolidated financial statements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The amendment requires an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
884219_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad's consolidated financial statements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	The amendment requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for leases with lease terms greater than one year.
884219_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	The amendment requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.
884219_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations.
884219_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	The amendment simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
884219_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Early adopted on a retrospective basis.
884219_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	As a result, current deferred tax assets of $22.9 million were reclassified to non-current on the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet.
884219_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Share-Based Compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors, and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan ).
884219_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	The 2007 Plan has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards; and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	The number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2007 Plan is limited to 1.7 million shares plus shares awarded under the 1997 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (which terminated in May 2007) (the 1997 Plan ) that subsequently cease for any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent the shares are exercised for, or settled in, vested and non-forfeited shares) up to an aggregate maximum of 1.5 million shares.
884219_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	As of December 31, 2015, there were 959,330 total shares available for future grant.
884219_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense:
884219_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	In addition, $45,000 of costs, $0.1 million of benefits, and $0.7 million of costs associated with share-based compensation were included in restructuring expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
884219_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	The 2015 amount of $45,000 related to restricted stock units.
884219_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	The 2014 amount of $0.1 million related to the reversal of expense of PUP awards.
884219_16_ITEM15_P64_S3	Of the 2013 amount, $0.3 million related to the restricted stock units and PUP awards.

884219_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and the Company is a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_16_ITEM15_P214_S1	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29 percent of Viad s regular full-time employees are covered by collective-bargaining agreements.
884219_16_ITEM15_P214_S2	If the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact the Company s businesses and results of operations.

884219_16_ITEM15_P214_S6	Although the Company s labor relations are currently stable, disruptions pending the outcome of the Chicago Teamsters Local 727 negotiations could occur, as they could with any collective-bargaining agreement negotiation, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the Marketing Events Group.

884219_16_ITEM15_P215_S2	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_16_ITEM15_P216_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_16_ITEM15_P216_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_16_ITEM15_P216_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.

884219_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $0.2 million to $0.5 million on a per claim basis.
884219_16_ITEM15_P218_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_16_ITEM15_P218_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $5.6 million, $4.8 million and $6.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

884219_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Viad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad s current businesses, or offer growth opportunities to Viad.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Acquisitions can involve a number of risks, including the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; increased debt; new regulatory requirements; the disruption of Viad s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If Viad makes changes to its business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect its business operations, the Company may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Viad s businesses and results of operations are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Viad s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by changes in the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The results of operations for GES U.S. and GES International depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Further, many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company s services.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the results of operations for GES are adversely affected.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Revenue from Pursuit depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Viad s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Viad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in ce rtain other countries.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign excha nge rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of those foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated ba lance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity r isk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In addition, for purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	During 2016, GES derived approximately 24 percent of its revenue and 19 percent of its segment operating income from GES International.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	During 2016, Pursuit derived approximately 59 percent of its revenue and 74 percent of its segment operating income from its Canadian operations, which are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar, relative to other currencies, could affect customer volumes and the results of operations of Pursuit.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Show rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The business activities of GES are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer) or may be held at a different time of year than when previously held.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The factors described above may cause the results of operations for those businesses to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Viad s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The success of Viad s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees, or others, to travel.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents, and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from exhibition facilities could adversely impact revenue.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Although no single client accounted for more than 6.1 percent of Viad s consolidated revenue in 2016, GES U.S. and GES International have a relatively small number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Consistent with industry practice, and only after a favorable review of credit worthiness, some of those larger clients have also been granted extended payment terms.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	The loss of any of these large clients, or the failure of such clients to pay in accordance with any extended payment terms, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of GES U.S. and GES International.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, revenue of GES may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing, or other services.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	When GES is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the event organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform those electrical and plumbing services, subject to the exhibition facility s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider).
884219_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, some of those facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of those services.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If a large number of facilities with which GES has those relationships choose to in-source those services, such a decision could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Viad s key businesses are relationship driven.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The business activities of GES U.S. and GES International are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Those relationships require the account team to become attuned to the clie nt s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and ta ke those customers to a competitor.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Viad s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Exhibition and event activity for GES U.S. and GES International varies significantly depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Pursuit experiences peak activity during the summer months.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	During 2016, 90 percent of Pursuit s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because of the seasonal nature of Viad s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	From time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance, and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays, cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals, as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with Viad s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	GES U.S. and GES International rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities, and customer facilities.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If Viad s customers and suppliers were unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts, or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on the businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Union-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and Viad s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Either event could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Additionally, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Obligations to fund multi-employer pension plans, to which Viad contributes, may have an adverse impact on its results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Viad s contributions to those multi-employer plans in 2016 and 2015 totaled $25.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Viad does not directly manage those multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to those plans.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have a material adverse effect on Viad s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Refer to Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Th e new presidential administration may make substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that may adversely affect Viad s business .
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The new presidential administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, which may include compreh ensive tax reform.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to its business.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect its business.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	It is likely that some policies adopted by the new presidential administrati on will benefit the Company and others will negatively affect the Company.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Until Viad knows what changes are enacted, the Company will not know whether in total it benefits from, or is negatively affected by, the changes.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Viad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact its results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Viad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Competition in the Live Events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting it results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Viad s inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Viad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food, and fresh meats.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Some of those businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, future events or proceedings could contradict with current assumptions, which could cause reserves or insurance to become inadequate and, ultimately, have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad s business.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad s businesses.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Such catastrophic events could impact GES production facilities, preventing the Company from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and could also cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Such catastrophic events could also adversely impact the businesses of Pursuit, which are heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S9	The guests serviced by Pursuit tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions during a given season, and catastrophic events could impede the guests ability to travel, interrupt the Company s business operations, and/or cause damage to the Company s properties.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S10	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could have a material adverse effect on Viad s results of operations and financial condition.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm the Company s reputation.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Viad s businesses store and process a significant amount of personally identifiable information in connection with the services they provide to customers.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If the Company s security controls over personal data, training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices and procedures do not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, the Company s reputation could be harmed, and the Company could face legal exposure to customers and other liabilities under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Certain of the Company s services also enable its customers to store and process personal data.
884219_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Perceptions that the Company s services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could have a material adverse effect on Viad s businesses and results of operations.

884219_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Viad is an international experiential services company with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates.
884219_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Viad is committed to providing unforgettable experiences to its clients and guests.
884219_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Viad operates through three reportable business segments: GES U.S., GES International, (collectively, GES ), and Pursuit.

884219_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Pursuit remains focused on delivering inspiring and unforgettable experiences in iconic locations while growing and enhancing its unique portfolio of integrated tourism assets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Non-GAAP Measures In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the Company also discloses non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment operating income, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, organic revenue, and organic segment operating income (collectively, the Non-GAAP Measures ).
884219_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures is supplemental to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	As not all companies use identical calculations, the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	Management believes that the presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures provides useful information to investors regarding Viad s results of operations for trending, analyzing, and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad s business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before the Company s portion of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
884219_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Segment operating income is defined by Viad as net income attributable to Viad before income (loss) from discontinued operations, corporate activities, interest expense and interest income, income taxes, restructuring charges, impairment losses and recoveries, and the reduction for income attributable to non-controlling interest.
884219_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Segment operating income is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operating segments to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined by Viad as segment operating income (as defined above) before non-cash depreciation and amortization and acquisition integration costs, if any.
884219_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Adjusted Segment EBITDA is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of Viad s operating segments and acquisitions to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	For a discussion of how this metric is used in connection with 2017 full year acquisition performance expectations, refer to the Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD A. Management believes that Adjusted Segment EBITDA for acquisitions enables investors to assess how effectively management is investing capital into major corporate development projects, both from a valuation and return perspective.
884219_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating income are defined by Viad as revenue and segment operating income (as defined above), respecti vely, without the impact of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods.
884219_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The impact of exchange rate variances is calculated as the difference between current period acti vity translated at the current period s exchange rates and the comparable prior period s exchange rates.
884219_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Management believes that the presentation of organic results permits investors to better understand Viad s performance without the effects of exchang e rate variances or acquisitions and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of Viad s operating performance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for reconciliations of organic revenue and organic segment operating inc ome to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
884219_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Non-GAAP Measures are considered useful operating metrics as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation and amortization, debt service costs, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in additional measures considered to be indicative of Viad s ongoing operations and segment performance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Although the Non-GAAP Measures are used as financial measures to assess the performance of the business, the use of these measures is limited because these measures do not consider material costs, expenses, and other items necessary to operate the business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment charges or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Since the Non-GAAP Measures do not consider the above items, a user of Viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the Company s performance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Adjusted EBITDA increased $35.6 million in 2016 primarily due to higher segment operating income at GES and Pursuit.
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to lower corporate costs, offset in part by higher restructuring charges.
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has also provided Adjusted Segment EBITDA and segment operating income as forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures within the Results of Operations section of this MD A. The Company does not provide reconciliations of these forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible, not all of the information necessary for quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts.
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	Consequently, any attempt to disclose such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.
884219_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	It is probable that these forward-looking Non-GAAP Measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP Measures.
884219_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Refer to Note 21 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
884219_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total revenue increased $115.9 million or 10.6 percent, mainly due to the incremental revenue from acquisitions completed during 2016, primarily CATC, ON Services, and Maligne Lake Tours, of $55.7 million, positive show rotation of approximately $52 million, and continued underlying growth in both GES and Pursuit, offset in part by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $24.0 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Net income attributable to Viad increased $15.7 million or 58.9 percent, primarily due to increased segment operating income at GES and Pursuit, offset in part by higher income tax expense.
884219_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total segment operating income increased $31.3 million or 57.4 percent, primarily due to high flow-through on the increase in revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Total revenue increased $24.1 million or 2.3 percent, primarily due to the incremental revenue from the acquisitions of onPeak, Blitz, N200, and the West Glacier Properties of $49.1 million, U.S. base same-show revenue growth of 8.0 percent, and new business wins in GES as well as revenue growth in attractions in Pursuit, offset in part by negative show rotation of approximately $71 million and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $39.7 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Management defines base same-show revenue as revenue derived from shows that the Company produced out of the same city during the same quarter in each year.
884219_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net income attributable to Viad decreased $25.7 million or 49.2 percent, primarily due to decreased segment operating income, the discontinued operations income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park, Inc. s concession contract with the Park Service, and the $11.7 million reversal of a valuation allowance in 2014 in connection with the Company s analysis of its deferred tax assets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Total segment operating income decreased $5.3 million or 8.8 percent, primarily due to higher performance-based incentives, non-cash depreciation and amortization from acquisitions completed in 2014 of $7.3 million, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.7 million, offset in part by flow through from higher revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Viad decreased $12.0 million due to the income in 2014 related to the expiration of Glacier Park, Inc. s concession contract with the Park Service.

884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	GES U.S. GES U.S. revenue increased $105.5 million or 14.6 percent, primarily due to positive show rotation of approximately $59 million, base same-show revenue growth of 4.1 percent, the incremental revenue from the acquisition of ON Services of $21.3 million, new business wins, and increased sales to corporate clients.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Base same-show revenue represented 39.1 percent of GES U.S. 2016 organic revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	Organic revenue increased $84.2 million or 11.7 percent.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	GES U.S. operating income increased $26.0 million, primarily due to higher revenue and the strong operating leverage that exists within the GES business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	ON Services generated a segment operating loss of $0.8 million during Viad s partial year of ownership, which included depreciation and amortization expense of $4.0 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	Organic operating income increased $26.8 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	GES International GES International revenue decreased $24.1 million or 8.9 percent, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $22.6 million and negative show rotation of approximately $7 million, offset in part by new business wins.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	Organic revenue decreased $1.5 million or 0.5 percent.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	GES International operating income decreased $2.5 million or 20.6 percent, primarily reflecting lower revenue and investments in personnel and assets to support continued growth of the business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P29_S9	Organic operating income decreased $1.8 million or 15.1 percent.
884219_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	2017 Outlook Although GES has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenue is affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest growth.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	For the 2017 full year, management expects GES revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate versus 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The August 2016 acquisition of ON Services is expected to provide incremental revenue of $45 million to $48 million and incremental Adjusted Segment EBITDA of $11 million to $13 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	GES show rotation is expected to have a negative impact on revenue of approximately $20 million compared to 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	GES U.S. base same-show revenue is expected to increase at a mid-single digit rate.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	Management anticipates an unfavorable FX Impact on GES 2017 full year revenue and segment operating income of approximately $20 million and $1 million, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P31_S6	The expected FX Impact reflects the expectation that the U.S. dollar to the British pound exchange rate will be $1.23 and the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate will be $0.74 during 2017.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management is executing a strategic growth plan to position GES as the preferred global, full-service provider for Live Events, with further reach to corporate events, consumer events, conferences and exhibitions.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	In support of this strategy, the Company acquired two leading audio-visual production businesses and three leading event technology businesses since 2014 that complement, enhance, and expand the current business and offer higher-margin growth opportunities.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Management continues to pursue additional opportunities to acquire businesses with proven products and services to create the most comprehensive suite of services for the Live Events industry.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	During 2017, management intends to make selective investments in additional resources to capitalize on continued growth opportunities in under-penetrated categories of Live Events, such as corporate events and consumer events, and in cross-selling new services.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	Additionally, management remains focused on improving the profitability of GES through continued efforts to more effectively manage labor costs by driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning that reduces the ratio of labor costs to revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	Improving this metric is a top priority of management and the Company continues to develop and enhance tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement, and benchmarking.

884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Pursuit revenue increased $41.2 million or 36.7 percent, primarily due to the incremental revenue of $34.4 million from acquisitions completed during 2016, primarily CATC and Maligne Lake Tours, increases across all hospitality assets and attractions, offset in part by the strategic downsizing of the transportation line of business and an unfavorable FX Impact of $1.3 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Organic revenue increased $8.1 million or 7.2 percent.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Pursuit operating income increased $7.9 million or 28.4 percent, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by higher accruals for performance-based incentives, acquisition transaction-related costs, and investments to support continued growth of the business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Organic operating income decreased $0.1 million or 0.4 percent.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	2017 Outlook For the 2017 full year, management expects Pursuit s revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate, primarily due to the December 2016 acquisition of FlyOver Canada and the March 2016 acquisition of CATC, which combined are expected to provide incremental revenue of $10 million to $12 million and incremental Adjusted Segment EBITDA of $2 million to $3.5 million, which includes an incremental first quarter seasonal operating loss of approximately $3 million from CATC.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	FlyOver Canada is expected to contribute incremental revenue of $9 million to $10 million with Adjusted Segment EBITDA of $5 million to $5.5 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P40_S6	Management anticipates an unfavorable FX Impact on Pursuit s 2017 full year revenue and segment operating income of approximately $3 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Additionally, management expects Pursuit s revenue to be negatively impacted by approximately $13 million as the Company completes the previously announced downsizing of Brewster Travel Canada s package tours line of business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The fire-related closure of the Mount Royal Hotel is expected to negatively impact revenue by approximately $6 million, which assumes the hotel will remain closed for the duration of 2017 and the proceeds from the Company s business interruption insurance will be recorded when received.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Management expects these factors will be offset by organic growth across the rest of Pursuit s lines of b usiness including expected revenue growth of $7 million to $9 million from the newly renovated Banff Gondola.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	During 2016 and 2015, Pursuit derived approximately 59 percent and 73 percent, respectively, of revenue and 74 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of segment operating income from its Canadian operations, which are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar, relative to other currencies, could affect customer volumes and the results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	Additionally, Pursuit is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	2015 compared with 2014 The following table provides a comparison of Pursuit s reported revenue and segment operating results to organic revenue and organic segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in order to better understand the underlying performance of the segment without the effects of acquisitions or FX Impact.
884219_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Acquisitions include the West Glacier Properties (acquired July 2014).
884219_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.
884219_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	For more information about organic revenue and organic segment operating results, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A.
884219_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Refer to Note 21 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
884219_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Pursuit revenue decreased $8.3 million or 6.9 percent, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $13.7 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Organic revenue increased $4.5 million or 3.9 percent, primarily due to higher effective ticket prices at the attractions and an increase in the number of passengers at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure .
884219_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Pursuit operating income decreased $0.3 million or 1.1 percent, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $4.6 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Organic operating income increased $4.3 million or 16.1 percent, primarily driven by increased attractions revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Performance Measures Management uses the following key business metrics to evaluate Pursuit s hospitality business: revenue per available room ( RevPAR ), average daily rate ( ADR ), and occupancy.
884219_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	These metrics are commonly used in the hospitality industry to measure performance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue for comparable hospitality properties.
884219_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability.
884219_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to generate.
884219_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Increases in ADR at hospitality properties lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on margins than increases in occupancy.
884219_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties.
884219_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), as well as increased ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).
884219_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Management evaluates the performance of Pursuit s attractions business utilizing the number of passengers and total attractions revenue per passenger.
884219_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The number of passengers allows management to assess the volume of visitor activity at each attraction during the period.
884219_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Total attractions revenue per passenger is calculated as total attractions revenue divided by the total number of passengers at all Pursuit attractions during the period.
884219_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	Total attractions revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_17_ITEM7_P52_S4	Total attractions revenue per passenger measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business.
884219_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	2016 compared with 2015 The following table provides Pursuit s same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all of Pursuit s properties and attractions that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	For Pursuit properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the Maligne Lake Tours attraction (acquired in January 2016), the CATC hospitality properties and attraction (acquired in March 2016), and the FlyOver Canada attraction (acquired in December 2016), as they were not owned by Viad for the entirety of 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Same-store passengers and revenue per passenger were affected by the partial closure of the Banff Gondola during 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Room nights available decreased during 2016 primarily due to changes in the opening dates of certain seasonal Glacier Park, Inc. properties as a result of management s review of a variety of factors, including weather conditions, opening dates of other properties in the area, and availability of seasonal employees.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Additionally, the Mount Royal Hotel in Banff, Canada suffered fire damage on December 29, 2016 and has been closed until further notice.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	RevPAR increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increases in both ADR and occupancy across all geographies resulting from management s focus on revenue management and strong park visitation in 2016 due in part to favorable weather conditions in contrast to forest fires during the third quarter of 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	The increase in the number of passengers for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to revenue management initiatives combined with strong park visitation.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the number of passengers increased across all attractions.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	Growth in passengers was especially strong at the Glacier Skywalk attraction as a result of management s decision to introduce a combination ticket that included both the Glacier Skywalk and the adjacent Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S6	Additionally, despite the Banff Gondola being partially closed for renovations during most of 2016, it showed strong demand with a 3.8 percent increase in the number of passengers during 2016 as compared to 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S7	Excluding the Banff Gondola passengers, total attraction passengers would have increased 15.1 percent in 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S8	Revenue per passenger remained flat during 2016 primarily due to lower revenue from ancillary food and beverage and retail services at the Banff Gondola due to its partial closure and the greater proportion of total passengers coming from the lower-priced Glacier Skywalk. 2015 compared with 2014 The following table provides Pursuit s same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S9	The same-store metrics below indicate the performance of all of Pursuit s properties and attractions that were owned by Viad and operating at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S10	For Pursuit properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_17_ITEM7_P55_S11	Management believes that this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the West Glacier Properties (acquired in July 2014), as it was not owned by Viad for the entirety of 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Room nights available were relatively flat in 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The slight increase was due to additional room nights available from the Denali Cabins due to its opening ten days earlier than the prior year as a result of management s review of a variety of factors, including the weather conditions, opening dates of other properties in the area, and availability of seasonal employees.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Additionally, the Grouse Mountain Lodge added one guest room in 2015, offset in part by St. Mary Lodge closing eight days earlier than the prior year due to the Going-to-the-Sun Road closure for construction.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	RevPAR increased in 2015 primarily driven by the Alaska Collection and the Brewster Travel Canada properties, offset in part by decreases at certain Glacier Park, Inc. properties (Glacier Park Lodge, St. Mary Lodge, and Grouse Mountain Lodge) as a result of forest fires during the third quarter of 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	ADR increased for the Alaska Collection and the Brewster Travel Canada properties due to higher room rates charged.
884219_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Occupancy decreased in 2015 primarily due to forest fires that affected certain Glacier Park, Inc. properties and decreases at the Elk + Avenue Hotel due to planned room renovation activity, offset in part by the Denali Backcountry Lodge which experienced a strong increase in occupancy in 2015 due to flooding in June 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Revenue per passenger increased primarily due to higher effective ticket prices.
884219_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The number of passengers decreased during 2015 at the Glacier Skywalk, which is attributed to widespread marketing efforts and a strong opening in 2014, and at the Banff Gondola due to the closure in October 2015 as part of the redevelopment project.
884219_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The decrease in the number of passengers was offset in part by an increase in the num ber of passengers at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure.
884219_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	Excluding the Banff Gondola fourth quarter passengers, total attraction passengers would have increased 2.4 percent in 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Corporate activities expense increased $0.6 million during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation expense, offset in part by costs related to a shareholder nomination and settlement agreement during 2015 and lower acquisition transaction-related costs in 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Corporate activities expense decreased $4.6 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily related to consulting and other transaction-related costs associated with acquisitions incurred primarily during the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and CEO transition costs of $2.7 million incurred during the fourth quarter of 2014, offset in part by costs related to a shareholder nomination and settlement agreement in 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	100 percent Interest expense increased $1.4 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances resulting from acquisitions completed during 2016.
884219_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Interest expense increased $2.5 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances resulting from acquisitions completed during the second half of 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Restructuring charges during 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to the elimination of positions and facility consolidations in GES, as well as the elimination of certain positions at Viad s corporate office and in Pursuit.
884219_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Restructuring charges during 2014 primarily related to the elimination of certain positions in GES, net of restructuring recoveries primarily related to updated estimates of facility contractual arrangements.
884219_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 32.8 percent, 27.7 percent, and 0.2 percent, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to a non-cash tax benefit of $1.6 million recorded in 2015 related to deferred taxes associated with certain foreign intangible assets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	The low effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards.
884219_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations during 2016 and 2015 primarily related to liability reserve adjustments and legal fees related to previously sold operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	On December 31, 2013, Glacier Park, Inc. s concession contract with the Park Service to operate lodging, tour and transportation and other hospitality services for Glacier National Park expired.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Upon completion of the contract term, Viad received cash paym ents in January 2014 of $25.0 million for the Company s possessory interest.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $21.5 million and an after-tax gain of $13.5 million which was recorded as income from discontinued operations in 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	In addition, 2014 income from discontinued operations included approximately $0.7 million, net of tax, related to the gain on sale of personal property at Glacier Park, Inc., as well as an insurance recovery of $0.3 million, net of tax.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	During 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, net of tax, due to additional reserves related to certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S5	Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $20.9 million as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $56.5 million as of December 31, 2015.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated net cash flow from operating activities of $100.3 million primarily from results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S7	Management believes that Viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S8	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $19.9 million of its cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States, consisting of $6.2 million in the Netherlands, $6.0 million in Canada, $4.1 million in the United Kingdom, $1.8 million in Germany, and $1.8 million in the United Arab Emirates.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S9	There are certain earnings related to the Company s Canadian, Netherlands, and United Kingdom operations that have historically been deemed permanently reinvested.
884219_17_ITEM7_P63_S10	As of December 31, 2016, the incremental tax associated with these earnings if the cash balances were repatriated to the United States would approximate $0.3 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	2016 compared with 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $40.0 million, primarily from results of operations and changes in working capital.
884219_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	2015 compared with 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.2 million in 2015, primarily from results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	2016 compared with 2015 Net cash used in investing activities increased $215.9 million, primarily due to cash payments, net of cash acquired, of $196.0 million for the acquisitions completed in 2016 of ON Services, FlyOver Canada, CATC, and Maligne Lake Tours, and an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the Banff Gondola renovations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	2016 compared with 2015 The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings of $133.8 million related to the acquisitions of ON Services, CATC, and FlyOver Canada completed in 2016 and a decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases of $4.1 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	2015 compared with 2014 The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of $141.0 million, offset in part by a decrease in dividends paid of $30.4 million related to a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share paid in 2014, and a decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases of $7.5 million.

884219_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Aggregate self-insurance liabilities of $33.3 million are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Refer to Note 9 Other Current Liabilities and Note 10 Other Deferred Items and Liabilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.

884219_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Additionally, Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	Refer to Note 20 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Viad has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
884219_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Furthermore, Viad does not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the Company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in Viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations, Note 19 Leases and Other, and Note 20 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Viad s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
884219_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
884219_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations, and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Based on these criteria, Viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to Viad, and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually.
884219_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value of the intangible assets may not be recoverable.
884219_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Viad s reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including the internal repo rting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components, and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	For GES U.S., goodwill is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level (all domestic operations of GES).
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	For GES International, goodwill is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations (GES EMEA and GES Canada).
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	For Pursuit, impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level (Brewster Travel Canada, the Alaska Collection, Glacier Park, Inc., and FlyOver Canada).
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S4	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_17_ITEM7_P78_S5	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) are estimated using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	In order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates, the Company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to Viad s market capitalization.
884219_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties, and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2016, Viad s aggregate goodwill was $254.0 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	As a result of the Company s most recent impairment analysis performed as of October 31, 2016, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test for each of GES reporting units in the U.S., GES EMEA, and GES Canada, was 153 percent, 137 percent, and 165 percent, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	For the Brewster Travel Canada, the Alaska Collection, and the Glacier Park, Inc. reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was 132 percent, 70 percent, and 14 percent, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	FlyOver Canada was acquired on December 29, 2016 and was not included in the October 31, 2016 impairment analysis.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	Significant reductions in the Company s expected future revenue, operating income, or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in a reporting unit s cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment charges.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	If an impairment indicator related to intangible assets is identified, or if other circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, the Company performs an assessment to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	This assessment includes a recoverability test to identify if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S6	If the results of the recoverability test identify expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets, a measurement of impairment is performed and any carrying amount in excess of fair value is recognized as an impairment.
884219_17_ITEM7_P82_S7	The Company periodically evaluates the continued recoverability of intangible assets which were previously evaluated due to an impairment indicator to determine if remeasurement is necessary.
884219_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Income taxes Viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
884219_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	Accordingly, the Company must estimate its actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	The Company uses significant judgment in forming conclusions regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates all available positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
884219_17_ITEM7_P83_S4	To the extent recovery does not appear likely, a valuation allowance must be recorded.
884219_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Viad had gross deferred tax assets of $58.3 million and $64.6 million, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	During the third quarter of 2014, the Company released a $10.1 million valuation allowance associated with foreign income tax credits.
884219_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company considered all available positive and negative eviden ce regarding the future recoverability of the foreign income tax credits, including recent operating history, future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, utilization history, and projected future U.S. taxable income.
884219_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	Based on the evaluation of all positi ve and negative evidence, it was determined to be more-likely-than-not that the foreign income tax credits carryforwards would be utilized before their expiration.
884219_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	At the end of 2016, the remaining foreign income tax credit carryforwards are $2.3 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P85_S4	If not utilized, the foreign income tax credits will begin to expire during 2020.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	While management believes that the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances, will be utilized in future periods, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	It is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in the Company s valuation allowance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Such a change could result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	Viad has not recorded deferred taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of its subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands as management intends to reinvest those earnings in its operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the incremental unrecognized tax liability (net of estimated foreign income tax credits) related to those undistributed earnings was approximately $6.8 million.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	To the extent that circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of those undistributed earnings will be remitted to the U.S., Viad would accrue income taxes attributable to such remittance.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which a determination is first made as to whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position.
884219_17_ITEM7_P86_S7	For all tax positions meeting this threshold, Viad recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
884219_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	The Company presently anticipates contributing $1.6 million to its funded pension plans and $0.9 million to its unfunded pension plans in 2017.
884219_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees, and dependents.
884219_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	In addition, Viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, Viad expects to contribute $1.1 million to the plans in 2017.
884219_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Refer to Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Share-based compensation Viad grants share-based compensation awards to officers, directors, and certain key employees pursuant to the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards; and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $8.0 million, $3.8 million, and $2.9 million, respectively, and the total tax benefits related to such costs were $3.0 million $1.5 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2016, 2015, or 2014.
884219_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on Viad s stock price on the date of grant.
884219_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, where applicable, and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price, and the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of Viad s stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.
884219_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Equity-based awards (including performance units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, until the time of settlement.
884219_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Viad uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Viad s expected stock price volatility, the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstand ing of which stock options have a ten-year life, the expected dividend yield on Viad s common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	While the Company has not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions of any future grants could result i n different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact Viad s future results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	Refer to Note 2 Share-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S4	Forward-Looking Statements As provided by the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Viad cautions readers that, in addition to historical information contained herein, this Annual Report includes certain information, assumptions, and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S5	These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but reflect current estimates, projections, expectations, or trends concerning future growth, operating cash flows, availability of short-term borrowings, consumer demand, new or renewal business, investment policies, productivity improvements, ongoing cost reduction efforts, efficiency, competitiveness, legal expenses, tax rates and other tax matters, foreign exchange rates, and the realization of restructuring cost savings.
884219_17_ITEM7_P95_S6	Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
884219_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties.
884219_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	Among other things, natural disasters, gains and losses of customers, consumer demand patterns, labor relations, purchasing decisions related to customer demand for exhibition and event services, existing and new competition, industry alliances, consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which Viad competes, acquisitions, capital allocations, adverse developments in liabilities associated with discontinued operations, changes in the levels of interest rates, and any deterioration in the economy and other risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, included in this Annual Report, may individually or in combination impact future results.
884219_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere, economic, competitive, governmental, technological, capital marketplace, and other factors, including terrorist activities or war, a pandemic health crisis, and international conditions, could affect the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses recorded in stockholders equity of $29.1 million and $23.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, unrealized foreign currency translation losses of $5.8 million and $35.7 million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As a result, Viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as revenue and segment operating results of its foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign revenue and segment operating results.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P1_S7	Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a discussion on the Foreign Exchange Rate Variances .
884219_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Canadian dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $2.8 million.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the British pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $0.2 million.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	A hypothetical change of 10 percent in the Euro exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately $0.4 million.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk, as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	From time to time, Viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Viad did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Viad is exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations.
884219_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.
884219_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with the SEC s published guidance, our management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at CATC, ON Services, and FlyOver Canada, which we acquired on March 11, 2016, August 11, 2016, and December 29, 2016, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 22.2% of total assets and 4.1% of revenue of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
884219_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

884219_17_ITEM10_P0_S0	Viad has adopted a Code of Ethics for all directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
884219_17_ITEM10_P0_S1	A copy of the Company s Code of Ethics is available at Viad s website at www.viad.com/about-us/corporate-governance/documents-and-charters/default.aspx and is also available without charge to any shareholder upon request by writing to: Viad Corp, 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900, Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

884219_17_ITEM15_P1_S0	SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 6, 2017.
884219_17_ITEM15_P2_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of Viad Corp and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
884219_17_ITEM15_P3_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_17_ITEM15_P3_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_17_ITEM15_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P5_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P5_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_17_ITEM15_P6_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P6_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_17_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_17_ITEM15_P7_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_17_ITEM15_P7_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_17_ITEM15_P8_S0	Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_17_ITEM15_P8_S1	The objective of this assessment was to determine whether Viad s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
884219_17_ITEM15_P8_S2	In accordance with the SEC s published guidance, our management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at CATC, ON Services, and FlyOver Canada, which we acquired on March 11, 2016, August 11, 2016, and December 29, 2016, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 22.2% of total assets and 4.1% of revenue of our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
884219_17_ITEM15_P8_S3	Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, Viad s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_17_ITEM15_P8_S4	Viad s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to its audit of the effectiveness of Viad s internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this Annual Report.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Phoenix, Arizona We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting for CATC, ON Services, and FlyOver Canada, which were acquired on March 11, 2016, August 11, 2016, and December 29, 2016, respectively, and are included in the 2016 consolidated financial statements of the Company and whose financial statements constitute 22.2% of total assets and 4.1% of revenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at CATC, ON Services, and FlyOver Canada.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S3	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_17_ITEM15_P9_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_17_ITEM15_P10_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated March 6, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

884219_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Viad Corp ( Viad or the Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and include the accounts of Viad and its subsidiaries.
884219_17_ITEM15_P16_S1	All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
884219_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	Nature of Business Viad is an international experiential services company with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates.
884219_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	Viad is committed to providing best in class experiences to its clients, customers, and guests by offering products and services designed to meet their current and future needs.
884219_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	Viad operates through three reportable business segments: GES U.S., GES International, (collectively, GES ), and Pursuit.
884219_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	GES GES, previously referred to as the Marketing Events Group, is a global, full-service provider for live events that produces exhibitions, conferences, corporate events, and consumer events.
884219_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	GES offers a comprehensive range of live event services and innovative technology to event organizers and exhibitors including core services, event technology, and audio-visual services all with a global reach.
884219_17_ITEM15_P20_S2	GES clients include event organizers and corporate brand marketers.
884219_17_ITEM15_P20_S3	Corporate brand marketers include exhibitors and domestic and international corporations that want to promote their brands, services and innovations, feature new products, and build business relationships.
884219_17_ITEM15_P20_S4	GES serves corporate brand marketers when they exhibit at shows and when GES is engaged to manage their global exhibit program or produce their proprietary corporate events.
884219_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Pursuit Pursuit, previously referred to as the Travel Recreation Group, offers guests distinctive and world renowned experiences in iconic natural and cultural destinations in North America through its collection of unique hotels, lodges, recreational attractions, and transportation services .
884219_17_ITEM15_P21_S1	Pursuit is composed of four lines of business: (i) Hospitality; (ii) Attractions; (iii) Transportation; and (iv) Travel Planning.
884219_17_ITEM15_P21_S2	These four lines of business work together, driving economies of scope and meaningful scale in and around the iconic destinations of Banff, Jasper, and Waterton Lakes National Parks and Vancouver in Canada, and Glacier, Denali, and Kenai Fjords National Parks in the United States.
884219_17_ITEM15_P21_S3	Pursuit is composed of Brewster Travel Canada, the Alaska Collection, Glacier Park, Inc., and FlyOver Canada.
884219_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
884219_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of Viad s reporting units used to perform annual impairment testing of recorded goodwill; allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable; provisions for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions; valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets; liabilities for losses related to self-insured liability claims; liabilities for losses related to environmental remediation obligations; sublease income associated with restructuring liabilities; assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations; assumptions used to determine share-based compensation costs under the fair value method; and allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_17_ITEM15_P22_S2	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Viad considers all highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
884219_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	Viad s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank demand deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	The Company s investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Viad maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.
884219_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	The allowances for doubtful accounts, including a sales allowance for discounts at the time of sale, are based upon an evaluation of the aging of receivables, historical trends, and the current economic environment.
884219_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Inventories Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies, as well as deferred show costs, including labor, show purchases, and commissions used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or market.
884219_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_17_ITEM15_P25_S3	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Capitalized Software Viad capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software.
884219_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training, and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_17_ITEM15_P26_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_17_ITEM15_P26_S4	These costs are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Viad has Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_17_ITEM15_P28_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash the Company could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_17_ITEM15_P28_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in Viad s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Self-Insurance Liabilities Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss, and medical claims.
884219_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	Viad has also retained certain liabilities related to workers compensation and general liability insurance claims in conjunction with previously sold operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P29_S2	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s prior historical experience, claims frequency, insurance coverage, and other factors.
884219_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels.
884219_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	Environmental Remediation Liabilities Viad has retained certain liabilities representing the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations primarily associated with previously sold operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The amounts accrued primarily consist of the estimated direct incremental costs, on an undiscounted basis, for contractor and other services related to remedial actions and post-remediation site monitoring.
884219_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when the specific obligation is considered probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
884219_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	Subsequent recoveries from third parties, if any, are recorded through discontinued operations when realized.
884219_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company maintains environmental insurance that provides coverage for new and undiscovered pre-existing conditions at both its continuing and discontinued operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for the estimated fair value of debt obligations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Foreign Currency Translation Viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	The functional currency of Viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_17_ITEM15_P35_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_17_ITEM15_P35_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad s consolidated balance sheets.
884219_17_ITEM15_P35_S4	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to Viad s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Revenue Recognition Viad recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
884219_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	GES derives revenue primarily by providing core services, event technology services, and audio-visual services to event organizers and exhibitors participating in live events.
884219_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	GES derives revenue from consumer events by charging visitors to view the touring exhibitions.
884219_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	Exhibition and event service s revenue is recognized when services are completed, net of commissions.
884219_17_ITEM15_P37_S3	Exhibits and environments revenue is accounted for using the completed-contract method.
884219_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Pursuit generates revenue through its hospitality, attractions, transportation, and travel planning services.
884219_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	Pursuit s revenue is recognized at the time services are performed.
884219_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Share-Based Compensation Viad recognizes and measures compensation costs related to all share-based payment awards using the fair value method of accounting.
884219_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	These awards generally include restricted stock, liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units), and stock options.
884219_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	These awards contain forfeiture and non-compete provisions.
884219_17_ITEM15_P39_S3	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on Viad s closing stock price on the date of grant.
884219_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Viad issues restricted stock awards from shares held in treasury.
884219_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Future vesting of restricted stock is generally subject to continued employment with Viad or its subsidiaries.
884219_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Holders of restricted stock have the right to receive dividends and vote the shares, but may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber the stock, except to the extent restrictions have lapsed.
884219_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	Restricted stock awards vest between three and five years from the date of grant.
884219_17_ITEM15_P41_S2	Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately three years except for certain awards with a five-year vesting period whereby expense is recognized based on an accelerated multiple-award approach over a five-year period.
884219_17_ITEM15_P41_S3	For these awards, 40 percent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant and the remaining shares vest in 30 percent increments over the subsequent two anniversary dates.
884219_17_ITEM15_P41_S4	Liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, where applicable, and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on Viad s stock price, and the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of Viad s stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.

884219_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements:
884219_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The standard establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
884219_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company may adopt either retrospectively to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients or with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures.
884219_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued several amendments in 2016 which do not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09.
884219_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Rather, they are intended to clarify and improve understanding of certain topics included within the revenue standard.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations including analyzing its current portfolio of customer contracts.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company has assigned internal resources in addition to the engagement of a third-party service provider to assist in the evaluation of the impact on its accounting policies, processes, and system requirements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	Based on the Company s preliminary assessment, the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on Viad s consolidated financial statements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S3	The Company expects the immaterial impact to primarily relate to the deferral of certain commissions which were previously expensed as incurred but will generally be capitalized and amortized over the period of contract performance, and the deferral of certain costs incurred in connection with trade shows which were previously expensed as incurred but will generally be capitalized and expensed upon the completion of the show.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S4	The Company is not planning to early adopt the standard and has not determined which transition method it will use.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S5	Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition.
884219_17_ITEM15_P52_S6	The Company is continuing its assessment, which may identify other impacts.
884219_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The amendment applies to inventory measures using first-in, first-out or average cost and will require entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
884219_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, minus the cost of completion, disposal and transportation.
884219_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	Replacement cost and net realizable value less a normal profit margin will no longer be considered.
884219_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad s consolidated financial statements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	The amendment requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for leases with lease terms greater than one year.

884219_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations including analyzing its existing operating leases.
884219_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	Based on the Company s preliminary assessment, the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on Viad s consolidated balance sheets, but the income statement is not expected to be materially impacted.
884219_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	The Company expects the most significant impact will relate to identifying facility and equipment leases and embedded lease arrangements.

884219_17_ITEM15_P56_S4	Adoption is dependent on the Company s analysis on information necessary to restate prior periods.
884219_17_ITEM15_P56_S5	The Company is continuing its assessment, which may identify other impacts.
884219_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	The amendment identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.
884219_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	The impact of the adoption of this new guidance will be dependent on the timing of when share-based awards vest or options are exercised, the Company s tax rate, and the intrinsic value at the time share-based awards vest or options are exercised.
884219_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	The amendment provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
884219_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations.

884219_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	The amendment requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory at the time that the transfer occurs.
884219_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its financial position or results of operations.

884219_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The amendment eliminates the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill if it was determined that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
884219_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Goodwill impairment will now be recognized by the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
884219_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	The amendment should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
884219_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
884219_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on Viad s consolidated financial statements and the Company expects the adoption to reduce the complexity surrounding the analysis of goodwill impairment.
884219_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
884219_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.
884219_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company adopted this guidance prospectively to all awards granted after the effective date.
884219_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
884219_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	The amendments require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
884219_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	For line-of-credit arrangements, an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement.
884219_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis which resulted in the reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.6 million from other long-term assets to a reduction in long-term debt on the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.
884219_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	The amendment requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.

884219_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	As of December 31, 2016, there were 861,561 total shares available for future grant.

884219_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	The equitable adjustments to the outstanding stock options reduced the exercise price and increased the number of shares of common stock underlying such options.

884219_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	As discussed above, the equitable adjustments to the outstanding stock options resulting from the special cash dividends paid on February 14, 2014 and November 7, 2013 reduced the exercise price and increased the number of shares of common stock underlying such options.
884219_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	This adjustment to the exercise price and the number of shares did not impact the compensation expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, or the unrecognized cost.
884219_17_ITEM15_P82_S2	Additional information pertaining to stock options is provided in the table below:

884219_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	Contributions In aggregate for both the domestic and foreign plans, the Company anticipates contributing $1.6 million to the funded pension plans, $0.9 million to the unfunded pension plans, and $1.1 million to the postretirement benefit plans in 2017.
884219_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	Weighted-Average Assumptions Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic ben efit costs as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2016 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.0 percent, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by the year 2026 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_17_ITEM15_P193_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2015 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.0 percent, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 4.5 percent by the year 2025 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_17_ITEM15_P193_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 by approximately $1.3 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_17_ITEM15_P193_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 by approximately $1.1 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	Multi-employer Plans Viad contributes to defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S1	The financial risks of participating in these multi-employer pension plans generally include the fact that assets contributed to the plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S2	Furthermore, if a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S3	In addition, if Viad were to discontinue its participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S4	Viad also contributes to defined contribution plans pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements, which are generally not subject to the funding risks inherent in defined benefit pension plans.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S5	The overall level of Viad s contributions to its multi-employer plans may significantly vary from year to year based on the demand for union-represented labor to support the Company s operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P194_S6	Viad does not have any minimum contribution requirements for future periods pursuant to its collective-bargaining agreements for individually significant multi-employer plans.

884219_17_ITEM15_P195_S2	Matching contributions are funded from shares of Viad common stock held in treasury.
884219_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	The Company has taken certain restructuring actions designed to reduce the Company s cost structure primarily within GES U.S. and GES International, as well as the elimination of certain positions at the corporate office.
884219_17_ITEM15_P196_S1	The Company implemented a strategic reorganization plan in order to consolidate the separate business units within GES U.S.
884219_17_ITEM15_P196_S2	The Company also consolidated facilities and streamlined its operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
884219_17_ITEM15_P196_S3	As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges in 2016, 2015, and 2014, primarily consisting of severance and related benefits as a result of workforce reductions and charges related to the consolidation and downsizing of facilities representing the remaining operating lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income) and related costs.

884219_17_ITEM15_P197_S2	Refer to Note 21 Segment Information, for information regarding restructuring charges by segment.

884219_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other Viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings, and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive, or other damages.
884219_17_ITEM15_P201_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings, or claims could be decided against Viad.
884219_17_ITEM15_P201_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2016 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, Viad believes that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on Viad s business, financial position, or results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	Viad is subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which Viad has or had operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P202_S1	If the Company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and Viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_17_ITEM15_P202_S2	As is the case with many companies, Viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P202_S3	As of December 31, 2016, Viad had recorded environmental remediation liabilities of $3.6 million related to previously sold operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P202_S4	Although it is a party to certain environmental disputes, Viad believes that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	As of December 31, 2016, Viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S1	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by Viad s subsidiary operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S2	The Company would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S3	The maximum potential amount of future payments that Viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2016 would be $9.3 million.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S4	These guarantees relate to facilities leased by the Company through September 2021.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable Viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_17_ITEM15_P203_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby Viad could recover payments.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	A significant portion of Viad s employees are unionized and the Company is a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S1	If the Company was unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact the Company s businesses and results of operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S2	Viad believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2017 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse effect on Viad s operations.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S3	The Company entered into showsite and warehouse agreements with the Chicago Teamsters Local 727, effective January 1, 2014, and those agreements contain provisions that allow the parties to re-open negotiation of the agreements on pension-related issues.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S4	The Company is in informal discussions regarding those issues with all relevant parties and is working diligently to resolve those issues in a manner that will be reasonable and equitable to employees, customers, and shareholders.
884219_17_ITEM15_P204_S5	Although the Company s labor relations are currently stable, disruptions pending the outcome of the Chicago Teamsters Local 727 negotiations could occur, as they could with any collective-bargaining agreement negotiation, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of GES.
884219_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	Viad s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees.
884219_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_17_ITEM15_P206_S1	In addit ion, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to ma ke payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM15_P206_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the amount of additional funding, if any, that Viad would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertaina ble.
884219_17_ITEM15_P207_S0	Viad is self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, employee health benefits, automobile, product and general liability, and property loss claims.
884219_17_ITEM15_P207_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to the Company s retention limit) related to Viad s continuing operations was $18.9 million as of December 31, 2016 which includes $13.7 million related to workers compensation liabilities and $5.2 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_17_ITEM15_P207_S2	Viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses of $3.9 million as of December 31, 2016, related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM15_P207_S3	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on Viad s historical experience, claims frequency, and other factors.
884219_17_ITEM15_P207_S4	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_17_ITEM15_P208_S0	Viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $0.2 million to $0.5 million on a per claim basis.
884219_17_ITEM15_P208_S1	Viad does not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_17_ITEM15_P208_S2	Viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $5.0 million, $5.6 million, and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
884219_17_ITEM15_P208_S3	In addition, as of December 31, 2016, Viad recorded insurance liabilities of $10.5 million related to continuing operations, which represents the amount for which Viad remains the primary obligor after self-insured insurance limits, without taking into consideration the above-referenced insurance coverage.
884219_17_ITEM15_P208_S4	Of this total, $6.9 million related to workers compensation liabilities and $3.6 million related to general/auto liability claims which are recorded in other deferred items and liabilities in Viad s consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding receivable in other investments.
884219_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	Segment Information Viad measures profit and performance of its operations on the basis of segment operating income which excludes restructuring charges and recoveries and impairment charges.

884219_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Competition Pursuit generally competes on the basis of location, uniqueness of facilities, service, quality, and price.
884219_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Competition exists both locally and regionally across all four lines of business.
884219_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	The hospitality business has a large number of competitors and competes for leisure travelers (both individual and tour groups) across the United States and Canada.
884219_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	Pursuit s competitive advantage is its distinctive attractions and iconic destinations.
884219_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Growth Strategy Pursuit remains focused on delivering inspiring and unforgettable experiences in iconic locations while growing and enhancing its unique portfolio of integrated tourism assets through its Refresh-Build-Buy growth initiatives.

884219_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	On December 29, 2016, the Mount Royal Hotel was damaged by fire and closed.
884219_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	In July 2017, we resolved our property and business interruption insurance claims related to the fire for $36.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	We allocated $2.2 million to an insurance receivable, $29.3 million was recorded as an impairment recovery (partially offset by impairment charges of $0.2 million) related to construction costs to re-open the hotel, $2.5 million was recorded as a business interruption gain for the recovery of lost profits, $1.3 million was recorded as contra-expense to offset non-capitalizable costs incurred, and the remaining $1.0 million was recorded as deferred revenue that will be recognized over the periods the business interruption losses are actually incurred.
884219_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	Restorations and improvements will provide an elevated guest experience to room finishes and furnishings, lobby and lounge areas, exterior appearance, heating/cooling, sound insulation, and building systems.

884219_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	The new attraction is expected to open in 2019.
884219_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	On July 15, 2017, we added ten tiny homes to the St. Mary Lodge property as part of the Glacier Park Collection.
884219_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	The tiny home s design embraces a number of eco-forward elements, such as a fresh water/gray water system and pint-sized, energy-efficient appliances.
884219_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	Elements of luxury are woven into the design.
884219_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	Homes can accommodate up to four guests, with a sliding barn-style door separating a compact sleeping area from the cozy living area.
884219_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	In 2017, we began developing approximately 100 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to Glacier National Park that we acquired in connection with our 2014 purchase of the West Glacier properties.
884219_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	The new development will include a new RV and cabin park with 102 RV slips, 20 guest cabins, five employee housing cabins, guest registration, and a laundromat.
884219_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our site is ideally located at the Glacier Park entrance.
884219_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	We expect half of the new RV and Cabin Park to open during the 2019 season with the remainder opening for the 2020 season.
884219_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Financial information for our reportable segments and geographic areas is included in Note 22 Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K).
884219_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, technology, and know-how) are material to our business.
884219_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	We own or have the right to use numerous trademarks and patents in many countries.
884219_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as we use them, or as long as we maintain their registration status.
884219_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	Trademark registrations are generally for renewable, fixed terms.
884219_18_ITEM1_P94_S1	We also have patents for current and potential products.
884219_18_ITEM1_P94_S2	Our patents cover inventions ranging from a modular structure having a load-bearing surface we use in our event and exhibition services, to a surface-covering installation tool and method that reduces our labor costs and improves worker safety.
884219_18_ITEM1_P94_S3	Our U.S. issued utility patents extend for 20 years from the patent application filing date; and our U.S. issued design patents are currently granted for 14 years from the grant date.
884219_18_ITEM1_P94_S4	We also have an extensive design library.
884219_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	have also registered many of t he copyrights.
884219_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	In the U.S., copyright protection is for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
884219_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	While we believe that certain of our patents, trademarks, and copyrights have substantial value, the loss of an y one of them would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

884219_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Government Regulation and Compliance Compliance with legal requirements and government regulations represents a normal cost of doing business.
884219_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	The principal rules and regulations affecting our day-to-day business relate to transportation (such as regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and its state counterparts), employees (such as regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines implemented pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and general federal and state employment laws), unionized labor (such as guidelines imposed by the National Labor Relations Act), and U.S. and Canadian regulations relating to national parks (such as regulations established by Parks Canada, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the U.S. National Park Service).
884219_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	Some of our current and former businesses are subject to U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or our state law counterparts.
884219_18_ITEM1_P98_S2	Compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety provisions, including, but not limited to, those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and other actions relating to the environment, have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Employees We had the following number of employees as of December 31, 2017:
884219_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are good and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2018 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without a material adverse effect on our operations.
884219_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	We are governed by a Board of Directors comprised of seven non-employee directors and one employee director, and we have an executive management team consisting of four executive officers.
884219_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas Refer to Note 22 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for segment financial information.
884219_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	Available Information We were incorporated in Delaware in 1991.
884219_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VVI.
884219_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	Our website address is www.viad.com .
884219_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	All of our SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnished it to, the SEC.
884219_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	The information contained on our website is neither a part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this 2017 Form 10-K. Our investor relations website is www.viad.com/investors/investor-center/default.aspx and includes key information about our corporate governance initiatives, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors committee charters, our Code of Ethics, and information concerning our Board members and how to communicate with them.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We regularly evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance, or expand our current business, or offer growth opportunities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our acquired businesses might not meet our financial and non-financial expectations or yield anticipated benefits.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to conform controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with integration of operations; and retain the acquired business key personnel and customers.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Moreover, our acquisition activity potentially increases our debt, subjects us to new regulatory requirements, distracts our senior management and employees, and exposes us to unknown liabilities or contingencies that we fail to, or are unable to identify prior to closing.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	If our acquisitions cause us to make changes to our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product and service sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S7	We depend on our large exhibition event clients to renew their service contracts and on our exclusive right to provide those services.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S8	During 2017, no single client accounted for more than 6% of our consolidated revenue.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S9	However, GES has a number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If any of these large clients do not renew their service contracts, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S11	Moreover, when event organizers hire GES as the official services contractor, they also grant GES an exclusive right to perform electrical, plumbing services, and other services (the Event Services ) at the exhibition facility.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S12	However, exhibition facilities are under increasing financial pressure to in-source Event Services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider) as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, such as an increased supply of exhibition space.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P0_S13	If a large number of exhibition facilities choose to in-source Event Services, GES will lose the ability to provide Event Services despite being hired as the official services contractor, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our GES business is heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on having close collaboration and interaction with our clients.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	To be successful, our account team must be able to understand a client s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If we lose a key member of our account team, we could also lose customers and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We operate in highly competitive industries.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are engaged in a number of highly competitive industries.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Competition in the Live Events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, if we are unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, we could lose market share to our competitors.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Travel industry disruptions, particularly those affecting the hotel and airline industries, could adversely affect our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our business de pends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees, or others, to travel.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Factors adversely affecting the travel industry, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents, and international political instability and hostilities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Any of these factors, or other unexpected events that affect the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Transportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	GES relies on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibition, warehouse, and customer facilities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our customers and suppliers are unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, labor strikes, lockouts, or other events could adversely affect our ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The seasonality of our business makes us particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our GES exhibition and event activity varies significantly because it is based on the frequency and timing of shows, many of which are not held each year and which may shift between quarters.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The peak activity for our Pursuit business is during the summer months.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Consequently, during 2017, 87% of Pursuit s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If adverse events or conditions occur during these peak periods our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes, fires, and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, accidents involving our travel offerings or experiences, or the prospect of these events could disrupt our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Such catastrophic events could have a negative impact on GES production facilities, preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	They could also cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or disrupt the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Such catastrophic events could also have an adverse impact on Pursuit, which is heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Pursuit guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions, and catastrophic events could impede the guests ability to travel, interrupt our business operations, and/or cause damage to our properties.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S14	In addition, unfavorable media attention, or negative publicity, in the wake of a catastrophic event could damage our reputation or reduce the demand for our services.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P6_S15	If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are vulnerable to deterioration in general economic conditions.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our business is sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions that affect the cost of materials and operating supplies.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The success of our GES business largely depends on the number of exhibitions held, the size of exhibitors marketing expenditures, and on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We also suffer from reduced spending for our services because many exhibitors marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced when economic conditions deteriorate.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Consequently, marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Revenue from our Pursuit operation depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), enacted in late 2017, makes significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that could affect our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	It also limits interest rate deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Other provisions have tax consequences for our international operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Tax Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The Tax Act could also be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse impacts on our business operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The accounting treatment of these tax law changes is complex, and some of the changes may affect both current and future periods.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Others will primarily affect future periods.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As we have discussed elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, we believe our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the Tax Act on financial results is substantially, but not entirely, complete.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Consistent with guidance from the SEC, our financial statements reflect our estimates of the tax effects of the Tax Act on our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	provisional and may be adjusted prior to the end of 2018.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any such adjustments could affect our current or future financial statements, or both.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We continue to examine the impact of this tax reform legislation, a nd as its overall impact is uncertain, we note that the Tax Act could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have operations outside of the U.S. primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	During 2017, GES International and Pursuit s international operations accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated revenue and 58% of our segment operating income.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the currency translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	As a result, significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could result in material changes to the net equity position we report in our consolidated balance sheets.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We do not currently hedge equity risk arising from the translation of non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our participation in multi-employer pension plans could substantially increase our pension costs.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for our U.S. and Canada-based employees.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We are obligated to contribute to multi-employer pension plans under collective-bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We contributed $26.6 million in 2017 and $25.8 million in 2016 to those multi-employer pension plans.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	These multi-employer plans are managed by third-party boards of trustees.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Based upon the information we receive from plan administrators, we believe that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires us to reduce the underfunded status over defined time periods.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Moreover, we would be required to make additional payments of our proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested liabilities if a plan terminates, or other contributing employers withdraw, due to insolvency or other reasons, or if we voluntarily withdraw from a plan.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S9	At this time, we cannot determine with any certainty the amount of additional funding, if any, we could be required to make to those plans.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S10	However, significant plan contribution increases, could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Refer to Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Union-represented labor increases our risk of higher labor costs and work stoppages.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A significant portion of our employees are unionized.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, and we are required to renegotiate approximately one-third of those each year.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we increase wages or benefits as a result of labor negotiations, either our operating margins will suffer, or we could increase the cost of our services to our customers, which could lead those customers to turn to other vendors with lower prices.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Either event could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Additionally, if we are unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If that happens, we might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or we may incur additional costs to do so, both of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and threats.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We regularly collect and process credit, financial, and other personal, sensitive, and confidential information from individuals and entities who attend or participate in events and exhibitions that we produce, or who visit our attractions and other offerings.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, our devices, servers, computer systems, and business systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyberattacks, or we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information and company assets.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Despite our efforts to protect ourselves with insurance, and create security barriers to such threats, including regularly reviewing our systems for vulnerabilities and continually updating our protections, we might not be able to entirely mitigate these risks.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of information security threats could lead to business interruptions, delays or loss of critical data, misuse, modification, or destruction of information, including trade secrets and confidential business information, reputational damage, and third-party claims, any of which could adversely and materially affect our results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data could result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We store and process personally identifiable information from our customers, employees, and third parties with whom we have business relationships.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve and could lead to burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of the data.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, in July 2016, the EU and the U.S. agreed on a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	This framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in a predecessor mechanism.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlantic.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Also, in May 2018, the EU s new General Data Protection Regul ation (GDPR) will replace the existing EU Data Protection Directive, and it will have a significant impact on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The GDPR includes a requirement for businesses to self-report personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority and, under certain circumstances, to the affected data subjects.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	It also gives additional rights to individuals whose data are processed, including the right to erasure (also commonly known as the righ t to be forgotten) by having their records erased and the right to data portability.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Compliance with the myriad requirements could involve changes in our services, business practices, or internal systems that could likely increase our costs, lower revenue, reduce efficiency, or make it more difficult to compete with Non-U.S.-based firms.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our failure to comply with existing or new rules could result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, litigation, adverse publicity, o r could cause our customers to lose trust in our services .
884219_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, those violations could also put us in breach of our obligations under p rivacy laws and regulations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	New capital projects may not be commercially successful.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	From time to time, we pursue capital projects, such as our current efforts to upgrade some of our Pursuit offerings in order to seize opportunities that complement, enhance, and expand our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays, cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals, as well as additional risks specific to a project.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with our commercial expectations and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Show rotation affects our profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	GES results are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer) or may be held at different times of year from when they were previously held.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, the same exhibition may change locations from year to year resulting in lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost location.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Any of these factors could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The United Kingdom s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We operate substantial parts of our EU businesses from U.K-based entities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The June 23, 2016 U.K. referendum resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the EU.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The uncertainty surrounding the timing, terms and consequences of the U.K. s exit could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility and adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Once the U.K. exits from the EU, the regulatory and legal environment that would then govern our U.K. operations will depend on, in certain respects, the nature of the arrangements agreed to between the U.K., the EU, and other trading partners.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	It is likely that changes to our legal entity structure and operations in Europe will be required as a result of these arrangements, which might result in a less efficient operating model across our European legal entities.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect our results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We, and our predecessors, have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food, and fresh meats.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Some of those businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, we may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries.
884219_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Although we believe we have adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, future events or proceedings could contradict with current assumptions, which could cause reserves or insurance to become inadequate and, ultimately, materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Multi-use facilities include manufacturing, sales and design, office, storage and/or warehouse, and truck marshaling yards.
884219_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Multi-use facilities vary in size up to approximately 677,800 square feet at GES U.S. and approximately 133,600 square feet at GES International.
884219_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Includes four hotels/lodges, an office, all of the owned garages, and all of the Canadian-based attractions situated on land subject to multiple long-term ground leases with the Canadian government.
884219_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	Includes ancillary food and beverage services, retail, and recreational facilities.
884219_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our headquarters is leased and approximates 19,900 square feet, and is located at 1850 North Central Avenue, Suite 1900 in Phoenix, Arizona 85004-4565.
884219_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our business operations and that capacity is sufficient for current needs.
884219_18_ITEM2_P3_S2	For additional information related to our lease obligations, refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations and Note 19 Leases and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K).

884219_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	On November 3, 2017, we acquired the controlling interest (54.5% of the common stock) in Esja, a private corporation in Reykjavik, Iceland, The Esja acquisition contains a put option that gives the minority Esja shareholders the right to sell (or put ) their Esja shares to us based on a calculated formula within a predefined term.
884219_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are an international experiential services company with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates.
884219_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	We are committed to providing unforgettable experiences to our clients and guests.
884219_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We operate through three reportable business segments: GES U.S., GES International, (collectively, GES ), and Pursuit.
884219_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	GES is a global, full-service provider for live events that produces exhibitions, conferences, corporate events, and consumer events.
884219_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	GES offers a comprehensive range of live event services and a full suite of audio-visual services from creative and technology to content and design, along with online tools powered by next generation technologies that help clients easily manage the complexities of their events.
884219_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Pursuit is a collection of iconic natural and cultural destination travel experiences that enjoy perennial demand.
884219_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Pursuit offers guests distinctive and world renowned experiences through its collection of unique hotels and lodges, world-class recreational attractions, and ground transportation services.
884219_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Total revenue increased $102.0 million or 8.5%, mainly due to the incremental revenue from the ON Services and FlyOver Canada acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, the Poken, and CATC acquisitions, of $52.6 million and underlying growth at GES and Pursuit, offset in part by negative show rotation of approximately $8 million and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $5.6 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Net income attributable to Viad increased $15.4 million or 36.5%, primarily due to impairment recoveries of $29.1 million related to the Mount Royal Hotel fire, higher segment operating income, and a decrease in restructuring charges, offset in part by higher tax expense, including a $16.1 million charge as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) enacted on December 22, 2017, higher corporate activities expense due to an increase in performance-based compensation driven by our stock price appreciation, and higher interest expense.
884219_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Total segment operating income (1) increased $11.1 million or 12.9%, primarily due to the increase in revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Total revenue increased $115.9 million or 10.6%, mainly due to the incremental revenue from the 2016 acquisitions, primarily CATC, ON Services, and Maligne Lake Tours of $55.7 million, positive show rotation of approximately $52 million, and continued underlying growth in both GES and Pursuit, offset in part by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $24.0 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net income attributable to Viad increased $15.7 million or 58.9%, primarily due to increased segment operating income at GES and Pursuit, offset in part by higher income tax expense.
884219_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total segment operating income (1) increased $31.3 million or 57.4%, primarily due to high flow-through on the increase in revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Refer to Note 22 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure, segment operating income, to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
884219_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Foreign Exchange Rate Variances We conduct our foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	2017 compared with 2016 The following table summarizes the foreign exchange rate variance effects (or FX Impact ) on revenue and segment operating results from our significant international operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, excluding the effect of acquisitions completed during 2017 and 2016:
884219_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	2016 compared with 2015 The following table summarizes the FX Impact on revenue and segment operating results from our significant international operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the effect of acquisitions completed during 2016:
884219_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The 2017 and 2016 revenue and segment operating results were primarily impacted by the weakening of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
884219_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Future changes in the exchange rates may impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons when revenue and segment operating results are translated into U.S. dollars.
884219_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Analysis of Revenue and Operating Results by Reportable Segment GES 2017 compared with 2016 The following table presents a comparison of GES reported revenue and segment operating results to organic revenue (3) and organic segment operating results (3) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Acquisitions include ON Services (acquired August 2016) for GES U.S. and Poken (acquired March 2017) for GES International and GES U.S.
884219_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	To maximize synergies, GES existing in-house audio-visual services team was merged into ON Services.
884219_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Accordingly, GES U.S. acquisitions include results from the existing in-house audio-visual team.
884219_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.

884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	GES U.S. GES U.S. revenue increased $45.7 million or 5.5%, primarily due to incremental revenue of $41.7 million mainly from the ON Services acquisition and, to a lesser degree, the Poken acquisition, base same-show revenue growth of 4.8%, and new business wins, offset in part by a low margin contract that expired in 2016 and was not renewed and negative show rotation of approximately $11 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Base same-show revenue represented 35.4% of GES U.S. organic revenue*.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Organic revenue* increased $4.0 million or 0.5%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	GES U.S. operating income decreased $6.0 million or 14.9%, primarily due to a less favorable mix of revenue, additional depreciation and amortization expense from the acquisition of ON Services and cost increases, offset in part by lower performance-based incentives and income of $2.8 million from a favorable contract settlement.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	Organic operating income* decreased $1.8 million or 4.2%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	GES International GES International revenue increased $34.2 million or 13.8%, primarily due to new business wins, same-show growth, and positive show rotation of approximately $3 million, offset in part by an unfavorable FX Impact of $7.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	Organic revenue* increased $40.5 million or 16.3%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S7	GES International operating income increased $5.8 million or 59.6%, primarily due to higher revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P18_S8	Organic operating income* increased $6.8 million or 70.6%.

884219_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	2018 Outlook Although GES has a diversified revenue base and long-term contracts for future shows, its revenue is affected by general economic and industry-specific conditions.
884219_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	In general, the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest growth.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	For 2018, we expect GES revenue will be up slightly from 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Show rotation is expected to have a net negative impact on GES revenue of approximately $40 million compared to 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	We expect GES U.S. base same-show revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	We anticipate a favorable FX Impact of approximately $18 million on GES 2018 full year revenue and approximately $0.5 million on GES segment operating income.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	The expected FX Impact assumes that the U.S. dollar to the British pound exchange rate will be $1.39 and the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate will be $0.81 during 2018.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S6	For more information about segment operating income, see the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. We are executing a strategic growth plan to position GES as the preferred global, full-service provider for Live Events, with further reach to corporate events, consumer events, conferences, and exhibitions.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S7	To support this strategy, since 2014, we have acquired two leading audio-visual production businesses and four leading event technology businesses that complement, enhance, and expand our current business and offer higher-margin growth opportunities.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S8	We continue to pursue additional opportunities to acquire businesses with proven products and services to create the most comprehensive suite of services for the Live Events industry.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S9	During 2018, we intend to make selective investments in additional resources to capitalize on continued growth opportunities in under-penetrated categories of Live Events, such as corporate events and consumer events, and in cross-selling new services.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S10	Additionally, we remain focused on improving GES profitability through continued efforts to effectively manage labor costs by driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre-show planning and on-site labor management that reduces the ratio of labor costs to revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P21_S11	Improving this metric is our top priority as we continue to develop and enhance tools to support and systematize show site labor planning, measurement, and benchmarking.

884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	GES U.S. GES U.S. revenue increased $105.5 million or 14.6%, primarily due to positive show rotation of approximately $59 million, base same-show revenue growth of 4.1%, the incremental revenue from the acquisition of ON Services of $21.3 million, new business wins, and increased sales to corporate clients.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Base same-show revenue represented 39.1% of GES U.S. 2016 organic revenue*.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Organic revenue* increased $84.2 million or 11.7%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	GES U.S. operating income increased $26.0 million, primarily due to higher revenue and the strong operating leverage that exists within the GES business.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	ON Services generated a segment operating loss of $0.8 million during our partial year of ownership, which included depreciation and amortization expense of $4.0 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	Organic operating income* increased $26.8 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S6	GES International GES International revenue decreased $24.1 million or 8.9%, primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact of $22.6 million and negative show rotation of approximately $7 million, offset in part by new business wins.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S7	Organic revenue* decreased $1.5 million or 0.5%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P26_S8	GES International operating income decreased $2.5 million or 20.6%, primarily reflecting lower revenue and investments in personnel and assets to support continued growth of the business.

884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Pursuit revenue increased $20.5 million or 13.4%, due to strong growth in organic attractions revenue primarily driven by the fully renovated Banff Gondola (which was closed for renovations from October 2015 through April 2016), incremental revenue of $10.0 million primarily from the FlyOver Canada acquisition and, to a lesser degree, the CATC acquisition, and a favorable FX Impact of $1.7 million, offset in part by a reduction in travel planning revenue as Pursuit completed the previously announced downsizing of the Banff Jasper Collection s package tours line of business and a revenue decline of $5.4 million due to the fire-related closure of the Mount Royal Hotel.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Organic revenue* increased $8.8 million or 7.1%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Pursuit operating income increased $11.4 million or 31.9%, primarily due to the increase in revenue from high-margin attractions.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	Operating income included a $2.5 million business interruption gain for the recovery of lost profits from the Mount Royal Hotel in 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	Organic operating income* increased $10.8 million or 36.5%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S5	2018 Outlook For 2018, we expect Pursuit s revenue to increase at a high-single to low-double digit rate.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S6	We expect a favorable impact to Pursuit s revenue of approximately $5 million from the planned re-opening of the Mount Royal Hotel in mid-year 2018.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S7	As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred business interruption recovery of $1 million relating to 2018 lost profits from the Mount Royal Hotel that will be recognized in Pursuit s segment operating results during the first half of 2018.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S8	We expect to incur start-up costs of approximately $1 million related to the development of our FlyOver Iceland attraction, which is expected to open in 2019.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S9	We anticipate a favorable FX Impact of approximately $5 million on Pursuit s 2018 revenue and approximately $1 million on segment operating income.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S10	In addition to these factors, we expect organic growth across the rest of Pursuit s lines of business.
884219_18_ITEM7_P30_S11	2016 compared with 2015 The following table provides a comparison of Pursuit s reported revenue and segment operating results to organic revenue (2) and organic segment operating results (2) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
884219_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the impacts of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods presented.

884219_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Pursuit revenue increased $41.2 million or 36.7%, primarily due to incremental revenue of $34.4 million from the 2016 acquisitions o f CATC and Maligne Lake Tours, increases across all hospitality assets and attractions, offset in part by the strategic downsizing of the transportation line of business and an unfavorable FX Impact of $1.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Organic revenue* increased $8.1 million or 7.2%.

884219_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Performance Measures We use the following key business metrics, common in the hospitality industry, to evaluate Pursuit s hospitality business:
884219_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue for comparable hospitality properties.
884219_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability.
884219_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to generate.
884219_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Increases in ADR at hospitality properties lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on margins than increases in occupancy.
884219_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties.
884219_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), as well as increased ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).
884219_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We evaluate the performance of Pursuit s attractions business utilizing the number of passengers and total attractions revenue per passenger.
884219_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The number of passengers allows us to assess the volume of visitor activity at each attraction during the period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Total attractions revenue per passenger is calculated as total attractions revenue divided by the total number of passengers at all Pursuit attractions during the period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Total attractions revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue.
884219_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	Total attractions revenue per passenger measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business.
884219_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	2017 compared with 2016 The following table provides Pursuit s same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The same-store metrics indicate the performance of all of Pursuit s properties and attractions that we owned and operated at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	For Pursuit properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	We believe this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the CATC hospitality properties and attraction (acquired in March 2016) and the FlyOver Canada attraction (acquired in December 2016), as we did not own them for the entirety of 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Additionally, the Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the Mount Royal Hotel hospitality property due to its fire-related closure (effective December 2016).
884219_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Banff Gondola attraction was closed for renovations from October 2015 through April 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Accordingly, 2016 includes only eight months of operation whereas 2017 includes the full year of operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Room nights available increased during 2017 primarily due to changes in the opening dates of certain seasonal properties.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy increased during 2017 primarily due to our focus on revenue management and refreshing key assets to enhance the guest experience, as well as strong park visitation during 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in the number of passengers during 2017 was primarily due to increased visitation at our Banff Gondola, which was closed for renovations during the first four months of 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Excluding the Banff Gondola, total same-store attraction passengers increased 53,225 in 2017 primarily driven by our efforts to enhance the guest experience and strong park visitation in Canada.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	Revenue per passenger increased during 2017 primarily due to higher effective ticket prices driven by our focus on revenue management and refreshing key assets to enhance the guest experience, and higher ancillary revenue primarily resulting from our recent renovations of the food and beverage and retail operations at the Banff Gondola and the food and beverage operations at the Columbia Icefield Glacier Discovery Center.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	During 2017, Pursuit derived approximately 64% of its revenue and 86% of its segment operating income from its Canadian operations, which are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S6	Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar, relative to other currencies, could affect customer volumes and the results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P45_S7	Additionally, Pursuit is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities.
884219_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	2016 compared with 2015 The following table provides Pursuit s same-store key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
884219_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The same-store metrics indicate the performance of all of Pursuit s properties and attractions that we owned and operated at full capacity, considering seasonal closures, for the entirety of both periods presented.
884219_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	For Pursuit properties and attractions located in Canada, comparisons to the prior year are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, using the current year quarterly average exchange rates for previous periods, to eliminate the FX Impact.
884219_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	We believe this same-store constant currency basis provides better comparability between reporting periods.
884219_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Same-Store Key Performance Indicators exclude the Maligne Lake Tours attraction (acquired in January 2016), the CATC hospitality properties and attraction (acquired in March 2016), and the FlyOver Canada attraction (acquired in December 2016), as we did not own them for the entirety of 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Same-store passengers and revenue per passenger were affected by the closure of the Banff Gondola from October 2015 through April 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Room nights available decreased during 2016 primarily due to changes in the opening dates of certain seasonal Glacier Park, Inc. properties as a result of management s review of a variety of factors, including weather conditions, opening dates of other properties in the area, and availability of seasonal employees.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	RevPAR increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increases in both ADR and occupancy across all geographies resulting from our focus on revenue management and strong park visitation in 2016 due in part to favorable weather conditions in contrast to forest fires during the third quarter of 2015.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The increase in the number of passengers for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to revenue management initiatives combined with strong park visitation.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the number of passengers increased across all attractions.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	Growth in passengers was especially strong at the Glacier Skywalk attraction as a result of management s decision to introduce a combination ticket that included both the Glacier Skywalk and the adjacent Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	Additionally, despite the Banff Gondola being partially closed for renovations during most of 2016, it showed strong demand with a 3.8% increase in the number of passengers during 2016 as compared to 2015.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	Excluding the Banff Gondola passengers, total attraction passengers would have increased 15.1% in 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	Revenue per passenger remained flat during 2016 primarily due to lower revenue from ancillary food and beverage and retail services at the Banff Gondola due to its partial closure and the greater proportion of total passengers coming from the lower-priced Glacier Skywalk.
884219_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The increase in corporate activities during 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation expense driven by our common stock price appreciation relative to December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in corporate activities during 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation expense, offset in part by costs related to a shareholder nomination and settlement agreement during 2015 and lower acquisition transaction-related costs in 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2017, as compared to 2016, and during 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher debt balances resulting from acquisitions completed during 2016 and 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Restructuring charges during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to the elimination of certain positions and facility consolidations in GES, as well as the elimination of certain positions at our corporate office and at Pursuit.
884219_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	On December 29, 2016, the Mount Royal Hotel was damaged by a fire and closed.
884219_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	During July 2017, we resolved our property and business interruption insurance claims related to the fire for a total of $36.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	We allocated $2.2 million to an insurance receivable, $29.3 million was recorded as an impairment recovery (partially offset by impairment charges of $0.2 million) related to construction costs to re-open the hotel, $2.5 million was recorded as a business interruption gain for the recovery of lost profits, $1.3 million was recorded as contra-expense to offset non-capitalizable costs we incurred, and the remaining $1.0 million was recorded as deferred income that will be recognized over the periods the business interruption losses are actually incurred.
884219_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income Taxes Excluding the impact of a $16.1 million net charge related to the Tax Act, income taxes went from an effective tax rate of 33% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to an effective rate of 28% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	The decrease was primarily due to higher foreign income taxed at lower rates, the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses, and the adoption of new accounting guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2017, which requires the excess tax benefit on share-based compensation to be recorded to income tax expense rather than equity.
884219_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	The 2016 effective tax rate of 33% increased from 28% in 2015 primarily due to a non-cash tax benefit of $1.6 million recorded in 2015 related to deferred taxes associated with certain foreign intangible assets.
884219_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $53.7 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $20.9 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net cash flow from operating activities of $112.2 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.
884219_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	As of December 31, 2017, approximately $52.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the United States, consisting of $22.6 million in Canada, $8.3 million in the Netherlands, $7.0 million in the United Kingdom, and $4.5 million in certain other countries.
884219_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	In addition, there is $9.6 million in Iceland related to our investment in Esja, which will be used to develop the FlyOver Iceland attraction.
884219_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	With the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, we recognized the taxes on the deemed repatriation of all earnings outside of the U.S. as of December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	All earnings have been deemed permanently reinvested by management.
884219_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the incremental tax associated with these earnings, if the cash balances were repatriated to the United States, would be zero.
884219_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	2017 compared with 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $11.9 million primarily from results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	2016 compared with 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $40.0 million, primarily from results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	2017 compared with 2016 Net cash used in investing activities decreased $219.0 million, primarily due to cash payments, net of cash acquired, in 2016 of $196.0 million for the ON Services, FlyOver Canada, CATC, and Maligne Lake Tours acquisitions, and the Mount Royal Hotel fire-related insurance proceeds received in 2017, offset in part by an increase in capital expenditures.
884219_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	2016 compared with 2015 Net cash used in investing activities increased $215.9 million, primarily due to cash payments, net of cash acquired, of $196.0 million for the 2016 acquisitions of ON Services, FlyOver Canada, CATC, and Maligne Lake Tours, and an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the Banff Gondola renovations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	2017 compared with 2016 The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to net debt payments of $45.8 million during 2017 compared to net debt proceeds of $120.8 million during 2016 related to the ON Services, CATC, and FlyOver Canada acquisitions completed in 2016 and an increase in cash used for common stock repurchases of $1.4 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	2016 compared with 2015 The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to net debt proceeds of $120.8 million during 2016 related to the ON Services, CATC, and FlyOver Canada acquisitions and a decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases of $4.1 million.

884219_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Aggregate self-insurance liabilities are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are uncertain.
884219_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Redeemable noncontrolling interest is also excluded from the above table as the redemption value of the put option and the timing and amounts of future cash outflows is uncertain.
884219_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	We are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings, and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive, or other damages.
884219_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Additionally, our business contributes to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees.
884219_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	Refer to Note 20 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	Furthermore, we do not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose us to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations, Note 19 Leases and Other, and Note 20 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S5	Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require us to make the most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
884219_18_ITEM7_P65_S6	We identified and discussed with our audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates:
884219_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually.
884219_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the intangible asset s carrying value may not be recover able.
884219_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Our reporting units are defined, and goodwill is tested, at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment, depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment, the level of integration among components, the sharing of assets and other resources among components, and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	GES U.S. goodwill is assigned to, and tested at, the operating segment level (all GES domestic operations).
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	GES International goodwill is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations (GES Europe, Middle East, and Asia ( GES EMEA ) and GES Canada).
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	Pursuit impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level (Banff Jasper Collection, the Alaska Collection, the Glacier Park Collection, and FlyOver).
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we use a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	The most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital (discount rate) applied to those cash flows.
884219_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	We estimate the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates (discount rates) using a build-up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit.
884219_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	In order to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimates, we perform a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.
884219_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	As noted above, the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	These estimates have inherent uncertainties, and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our aggregate goodwill was $270.6 million.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	As a result of our most recent impairment analysis performed as of October 31, 2017, the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units (expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts) under step one of the impairment test for GES U.S. was 134%, GES EMEA was 214%, GES Canada was 164%, Banff Jasper Collection was 147%, the Alaska Collection was 99%, the Glacier Park Collection was 16%, and FlyOver was 29%.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	Significant reductions in our expected future revenue, operating income, or cash flow forecasts and projections, or an increase in a reporting unit s cost of capital, could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing, which may result in impairment charges.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	If an impairment indicator related to intangible assets is identified, or if other circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, we perform an assessment to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S4	This assessment includes a recoverability test to identify if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S5	If the results of the recoverability test indicate that expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related assets, we perform a measurement of impairment and we recognize any carrying amount in excess of fair value as an impairment.
884219_18_ITEM7_P70_S6	We periodically evaluate the continued recoverability of intangible assets which were previously evaluated due to an impairment indicator to determine if remeasurement is necessary.
884219_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Income taxes We are required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
884219_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Accordingly, we must estimate our actual current income tax liability, and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes, as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes.
884219_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	We use significant judgment in forming conclusions regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and evaluate all available positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
884219_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	To the extent recovery does not appear likely, a valuation allowance must be recorded.
884219_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We had gross deferred tax assets of $38.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and $58.3 million as of December 31, 2016, which includes the remeasurement due to the reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting in an $8.0 million reduction in the 2017 gross deferred tax assets.
884219_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences, and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	While we believe that the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances, will be utilized in future periods, there are inherent uncertaintie s regarding the ultimate realization of these assets.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	It is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in our valuat ion allowance.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	Such a change could result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	Due to the enactment of the Tax Act and the transition to a territorial tax system, we recognized $6.9 million of current federal tax expense and $1.2 million of current state tax expense for the mandatory deemed repatriation of our estimated unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S4	With the transition to a territorial tax system, future dividends will be fully deductible for federal tax purposes, however they may be taxable at the state level.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S5	We have not recorded deferred taxes on the incremental additional state taxes or withholding taxes on dividends from our foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest those earnings in our foreign operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P74_S6	We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process: first we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and if so, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
884219_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Pension and postretirement benefits Our pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	We presently anticipate contributing $1.1 million to our funded pension plans and $1.0 million to our unfunded pension plans in 2018.
884219_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees, and dependents.
884219_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the employees service period.
884219_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	In addition, we retain the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	While the plans have no funding requirements, we expect to contribute $1.1 million to the plans in 2018.
884219_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	The discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review, and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high-quality, hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments.
884219_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	Refer to Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Share-based compensation We grant share-based compensation awards to our officers, directors, and certain key employees pursuant to the 2017 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has a 10-year life and provides for the following types of awards: (a) incentive and non-qualified stock options; (b) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (c) performance units or performance shares; (d) stock appreciation rights; (e) cash-based awards; and (f) certain other stock-based awards.
884219_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was $11.0 million in 2017, $8.0 million in 2016, and $3.8 million in 2015, and the total tax benefits related to such costs were $4.1 million in 2017, $3.0 million in 2016, and $1.5 million in 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2017, 2016, or 2015.
884219_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on our stock price on the date of grant.
884219_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Liability-based awards are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, where applicable, and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on our stock price, and the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our stock and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.
884219_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Equity-based awards (including performance units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, until the time of settlement.
884219_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model and key assumptions to determine the fair value of each stock option grant.
884219_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	These assumptions include our expected stock price volatility, the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding of which stock options have a ten-year life, the expected dividend yield on our common stock, and the risk-free interest rate.
884219_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	While we have not granted stock options since 2010, changes in the assumptions of any future grants could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants, and consequently impact our future results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	Refer to Note 2 Share-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for further information.
884219_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Non-GAAP Measures In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), we also disclose non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment operating income, organic revenue, and organic segment operating income (collectively, the Non-GAAP Measures ).
884219_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures is supplemental to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
884219_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	As not all companies use identical calculations, the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
884219_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	We believe the presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations for trending, analyzing, and benchmarking the performance and value of our business.
884219_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is net income attributable to Viad before our portion of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is used to measure the profit and performance of our operations and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
884219_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Segment operating income is net income attributable to Viad before income (loss) from discontinued operations, corporate activities, interest expense and interest income, income taxes, restructuring charges, impairment losses and recoveries, and the reduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
884219_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Segment operating income is used to measure the profit and performance of our operating segments to facilitate period-to-period comparisons.
884219_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Organic revenue and organic segment operating income are revenue and segment operating income (as defined above), respectively, without the impact of exchange rate variances and acquisitions, if any, until such acquisitions are included in the entirety of both comparable periods.
884219_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The impact of exchange rate variances is calculated as the difference between current period activity translated at the current period s exchange rates and the comparable prior period s exchange rates.
884219_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	We believe that the presentation of organic results permits investors to better understand our performance without the effects of exchange rate variances or acquisitions and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of our operating performance.
884219_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for reconciliations of organic revenue and organic segment operating income to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
884219_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Non-GAAP Measures are considered useful operating metrics as potential variations arising from taxes, depreciation and amortization, debt service costs, impairment charges and recoveries, changes in accounting principles, and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated, thus resulting in additional measures considered to be indicative of our ongoing operations and segment performance.
884219_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	Although the Non-GAAP Measures are used as financial measures to assess the performance of the business, the use of these measures is limited because these measures do not consider material costs, expenses, and other items necessary to operate our business.
884219_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	These items include debt service costs, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long-lived assets, expenses related to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, impairment charges or recoveries, and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	Since the Non-GAAP Measures do not consider the above items, a user of our financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of our performance.
884219_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	A reconciliation of net income attributable to Viad to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
884219_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during 2017 was primarily due to higher segment operating income at Pursuit and a decrease in restructuring charges.
884219_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was primarily due to higher segment operating income at GES and Pursuit.
884219_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	Refer to the Results of Operations section of this MD A for a discussion of fluctuations.
884219_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measure We also provide segment operating income as a forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure within the Results of Operations section of this MD A.
884219_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	We do not provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible, not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable efforts.
884219_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Consequently, any attempt to disclose such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that investors could find confusing or misleading.
884219_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	It is probable that this forward-looking Non-GAAP Measure may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP Measure.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our foreign operations are primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to our net equity position reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not currently hedge our equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We recorded cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses in stockholders equity of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and $29.1 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We recorded unrealized foreign currency translation gains in other comprehensive income of $17.1 million during of the year ended December 31, 2017 and foreign currency translation losses of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As a result, our consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as revenue and segment operating results of our foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We do not currently hedge our net earnings exposure arising from the translation of our foreign revenue and segment operating results.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this 2017 Form 10-K) for a discussion on the Foreign Exchange Rate Variances .
884219_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Canadian dollar exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 operating income of approximately $4.6 million.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A hypothetical change of 10% in the British pound exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 operating income of approximately $0.4 million.

884219_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk, as our foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary.
884219_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

884219_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	Pursuit Pursuit is a collection of iconic natural and cultural destination travel experiences that enjoy perennial demand.
884219_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	Pursuit is comprised of four lines of business: Hospitality, Attractions, Transportation, and Travel Planning.
884219_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	These four lines of business work together, driving economies of scope and meaningful scale in and around the iconic destinations of Banff, Jasper, and Waterton Lakes National Parks and Vancouver in Canada, and Glacier, Denali, and Kenai Fjords National Parks in the United States.
884219_18_ITEM8_P10_S3	Pursuit is comprised of Brewster Travel Canada, which is marketed as the Banff Jasper Collection; the Alaska Collection; Glacier Park, Inc., which is marketed as the Glacier Park Collection, and FlyOver.
884219_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
884219_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of our reporting units used to perform annual impairment testing of recorded goodwill; allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable; provisions for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions; valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets; liabilities for losses related to self-insured liability claims; liabilities for losses related to environmental remediation obligations; sublease income associated with restructuring liabilities; assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations; assumptions used to determine share-based compensation costs under the fair value method; assumptions in the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests; and allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses.
884219_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.
884219_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities when purchased of three months or less.
884219_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank demand deposits and money market mutual funds.
884219_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	Investments in money market mutual funds are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P12_S3	Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Allowances for doubtful accounts reflect the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.
884219_18_ITEM8_P12_S4	The allowances for doubtful accounts, including a sales allowance for discounts at the time of sale, are based upon an evaluation of the aging of receivables, historical trends, and the current economic environment.
884219_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Inventories Inventories, which consist primarily of exhibit design and construction materials and supplies, as well as deferred show costs, including labor, show purchases, and commissions used in providing convention show services, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out and specific identification methods) or net realizable value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
884219_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: buildings, 15 to 40 years; equipment, 3 to 12 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
884219_18_ITEM8_P13_S3	Property and equipment are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows.
884219_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Certain internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software are capitalized.
884219_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	Capitalized costs principally relate to costs incurred to purchase software from third parties, external direct costs of materials and services, and certain payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software projects once application development begins.
884219_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	Costs associated with preliminary project activities, training, and other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
884219_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	Capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from three to ten years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P14_S4	These costs are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption Property and equipment, net.
884219_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	We use a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) in order to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
884219_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions, financial forecasts, industry trends, and historical experience.
884219_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	These estimates, however, have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results.
884219_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	We have Company-owned life insurance contracts which are intended to fund the cost of certain employee compensation and benefit programs.
884219_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	These contracts are carried at cash surrender value, net of outstanding policy loans.
884219_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	The cash surrender value represents the amount of cash we could receive if the policies were discontinued before maturity.
884219_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	The changes in the cash surrender value of the policies, net of insurance premiums, are included as a component of Costs of Services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Self-Insurance Liabilities We are self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss, and medical claims.
884219_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	We retained certain liabilities related to workers compensation and general liability insurance claims in conjunction with previously sold operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on historical experience, claims frequency, insurance coverage, and other factors.
884219_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	We purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels.
884219_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	E nvironmental Remediation Liabilities Environmental remediation liabilities represent the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations primarily associated with previously sold operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The amounts accrued primarily consist of the estimated direct incremental costs, on an undiscounted basis, for contractor and other services related to remedial actions and post-remediation site monitoring.
884219_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when the specific obligation is considered probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
884219_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Subsequent recoveries from third parties, if any, are recorded through discontinued operations when realized.
884219_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Environmental insurance is maintained that provides coverage for new and undiscovered pre-existing conditions at both our continuing and discontinued operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for the estimated fair value of debt obligations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Non-redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Non-redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us.
884219_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Our non-redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to the equity ownership that we do not own in Glacier Park, Inc. of 20%.
884219_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	We report non-redeemable noncontrolling interest within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	The amount of consolidated net income attributable to Viad and the non-redeemable noncontrolling interest is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P23_S4	Noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests.
884219_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Esja purchase agreement contains a put option that gives the minority Esja shareholders the right to sell (or put ) their Esja shares to us based on a calculated formula within a predefined term.
884219_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	The amount of the net income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded to retained earnings and is included in our earnings per share.
884219_18_ITEM8_P24_S3	Refer to Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest for additional information.
884219_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Foreign Currency Translation Our foreign operations are primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and to a lesser extent, in certain other countries.
884219_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
884219_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
884219_18_ITEM8_P25_S3	The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P25_S4	For purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period.
884219_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
884219_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	GES derives revenue primarily by providing core services, event technology services, and audio-visual services to event organizers and exhibitors participating in live events.
884219_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	GES derives revenue from consumer events by charging visitors to view the touring exhibitions.
884219_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	Exhibition and event service s revenue is recognized when services are completed, net of commissions.
884219_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	Exhibits and environments revenue is accounted for using the completed-contract method.
884219_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Pursuit generates revenue through its hospitality, attractions, transportation, and travel planning services.
884219_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Pursuit s revenue is recognized at the time services are performed.
884219_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	Insurance Recoveries Receipts from insurance up to the amount of the recognized losses are considered recoveries and are accounted for when they are probable of receipt.
884219_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	Anticipated proceeds in excess of the recognized loss are considered a gain contingency.
884219_18_ITEM8_P28_S4	A contingency gain for anticipated insurance proceeds in excess of losses already recognized is not recognized until all contingencies relating to the insurance claim have been resolved.
884219_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Insurance proceeds allocated to business interruption gains are reported as cash flows from operating activities, and proceeds allocated to impairment recoveries are reported as cas h flows from investing activities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Insurance proceeds used for capitalizable costs are classified as cash flows from investing activities, and proceeds used for non-capitalizable costs are classified as operating activities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	On December 29, 2016, the Mount Royal Hotel was damaged by a fire and closed.
884219_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded an asset impairment loss of $2.2 million and an offsetting impairment recovery (and related insurance receivable) as the losses related to the fire were covered by our property and business interruption insurance.
884219_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	During July 2017, we resolved our property and business interruption insurance claims for a total of $36.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	We allocated $2.2 million to an insurance receivable, $29.3 million was recorded as an impairment recovery (partially offset by impairment charges of $0.2 million) related to construction costs to re-open the hotel, $2.5 million was recorded as a business interruption gain for the recovery of lost profits, $1.3 million was recorded as contra-expense to offset non-capitalizable costs incurred, and the remaining $1.0 million was recorded as deferred revenue, which will be recognized over the periods when the business interruption losses are actually incurred.
884219_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation costs, related to all share-based payment awards, are recognized and measured using the fair value method of accounting.
884219_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	These awards generally include restricted stock, liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units), and stock options, and contain forfeiture and non-compete provisions.
884219_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant.
884219_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	We issue restricted stock awards from shares held in treasury.
884219_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Future vesting of restricted stock is generally subject to continued employment.
884219_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Holders of restricted stock have the right to receive dividends and vote the shares, but may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber the stock, except to the extent restrictions have lapsed and in accordance with our stock trading policy.
884219_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Restricted stock awards vest between three and five years from the date of grant.
884219_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	For awards with a five-year vesting period, expense is recognized based on an accelerated multiple-award approach over a five-year period.
884219_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	For these awards, 40% of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant and the remaining shares vest in 30% increments over the subsequent two anniversary dates.
884219_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Liability-based awards (including performance units and restricted stock units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and where applicable, the level of achievement of predefined performance goals.
884219_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	These awards are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on our stock price, and the Monte Carlo simulation model, until the time of settlement.
884219_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of our stock price and the price of the common shares of a comparator group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term.
884219_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	To the extent earned, liability-based awards are settled in cash based on our stock price.
884219_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Compensation expense related to liability-based awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Equity-based awards (including performance units) are recorded at estimated fair value, based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals, until the time of settlement.
884219_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	To the extent earned, equity-based awards are settled in our common stock.
884219_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	Compensation expense related to equity-based awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of approximately three years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
884219_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Share-based compensation expense related to stock option awards is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period of approximately five years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The exercise price of stock options is based on the market value of our common stock at the date of grant.
884219_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	We have not granted stock options since 2010.
884219_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Common Stock in Treasury Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at historical cost.
884219_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Subsequent share reissuances are primarily related to share-based compensation programs and recorded at weighted-average cost.
884219_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	We apply the two-class method in calculating income per common share as unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, such securities are included in the earnings allocation in calculating income per share.
884219_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The adjustment to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reflected in income per common share.
884219_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements:
884219_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The standard establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
884219_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	We may adopt either retrospectively to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients or with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures.
884219_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued several amendments in 2016 which do not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09.
884219_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Rather, they are intended to clarify and improve understanding of certain topics included within the revenue standard.
884219_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	We assigned internal resources and engaged a third-party service provider to assist in evaluating the impact on our accounting policies, processes, and system requirements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Based on our assessment, the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	The impact primarily relates to the deferral of certain commissions which were previously expensed as incurred but will generally be capitalized and amortized over the period of contract performance, and the deferral of certain costs incurred in connection with trade shows which were previously expensed as incurred but will generally be capitalized and expensed upon the completion of the show.
884219_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 and will be using the modified retrospective transition method.
884219_18_ITEM8_P45_S4	Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition.
884219_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The amendment requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for leases with lease terms greater than one year.
884219_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The amendment requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.
884219_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	We are currently evaluating the potential impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position or results of operations including analyzing our existing operating leases.
884219_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Based on our current assessment, the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, however the income statement is not expected to be materially impacted.
884219_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	We expect the most significant impact will relate to facility and equipment leases, which are currently recorded as operating leases.
884219_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	We are continuing our assessment, which may identify other impacts.
884219_18_ITEM8_P47_S4	We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.
884219_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The amendment eliminates the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill if it was determined that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Goodwill impairment will now be recognized by the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
884219_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	The amendment should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
884219_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements and we expect the adoption to reduce the complexity surrounding the analysis of goodwill impairment.
884219_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The amendment identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.
884219_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The adoption of this new guidance resulted in a decrease in tax expense of $1.1 million, or a 1.1% decrease in our effective tax rate, as compared to 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense:
884219_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	We recorded share-based compensation expense through restructuring expense of $0.1 million during 2017, $0.2 million in 2016, and $45,000 in 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The 2017 and 2016 amounts relate to PUP and restricted stock units.
884219_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	The 2015 amount related to restricted stock units.
884219_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	No share-based compensation costs were capitalized during 2017, 2016, or 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P53_S4	The following table summarizes the activity of the outstanding share-based compensation awards:
884219_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan We grant share-based compensation awards to our officers, directors, and certain key employees pursuant to the 2017 Viad Corp Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The 2017 Plan was approved by our stockholders and was effective May 18, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The 2017 Plan replaced the 2007 Viad Corp Omnibus Stock Plan (the 2007 Plan ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	No further awards may be made under the 2007 Plan, although awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms.

884219_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	These guarantees relate to facilities leased through October 2027.
884219_18_ITEM8_P101_S5	There are no recourse provisions that would enable us to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P101_S6	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby we could recover payments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases was $4.8 million and accumulated amortization was $2.0 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases was $3.3 million and accumulated amortization was $1.7 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P103_S2	The amortization charges related to assets recorded under capital leases are included in depreciation expense.
884219_18_ITEM8_P103_S3	Refer to Note 6 Property and Equipment.
884219_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The weighted-average interest rate on total debt (including amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees) was 3.7% for 2017, 3.1% for 2016 and 3.2% for 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	The estimated fair value of total debt was $203.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $252.8 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	The fair value of debt was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity.
884219_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	Cash paid for interest on debt was $7.7 million for 2017, $5.5 million for 2016, and $4.2 million for 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The fair value of an asset or liability is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
884219_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The fair value guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and also establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
884219_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	Money market mutual funds and certain other mutual fund investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.
884219_18_ITEM8_P106_S4	The fair value information related to these assets is summarized in the following tables:
884219_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	Money market funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	There have been no realized gains or losses related to these investments and we have not experienced any redemption restrictions with respect to any of the money market mutual funds.
884219_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Other mutual funds are included in Other investments and assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	Unrealized gains of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2017 and $0.7 million ($0.4 million after tax) as of December 31, 2016 are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Refer to Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for the estimated fair value of debt obligations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	The components of basic and diluted income per share are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	Options to purchase 8,000 shares during 2017, 500 shares during 2016, and 4,000 shares during 2015 of common stock were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of dilutive shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
884219_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	We authorized five million shares of Preferred Stock and two million shares of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, none of which was outstanding on December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P111_S2	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in AOCI by component are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following table presents information about reclassification adjustments out of AOCI:
884219_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	Refer to Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Benefits.
884219_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	Income Taxes We record current income tax expense for the amounts that we expect to report and pay on our income tax returns and deferred income tax expense for the change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) that significantly changed the U.S. tax code and reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
884219_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, measured at the enacted tax rate applicable when the differences reverse.
884219_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	We recognized deferred tax expense of $8.0 million for the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Tax Act included the transition from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system and required a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ( E P ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had an estimated $174.0 million of undistributed foreign E P subject to the deemed mandatory repatriation and recognized current income tax expense of $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	In addition to the impact recorded as of December 31, 2017, the Tax Act changed existing tax laws, effective January 1, 2018, including the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and the increasing alternative minimum tax credit carryforward utilization, as well as establishing two new taxes, the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT ) and the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ) tax after the foreign intangible deduction ( FDII ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	Under the new BEAT regime, certain payments made to related foreign companies are treated as base-eroding and limits the deductibility of these payments and imposes a minimum tax in excess of regular tax liability.
884219_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	We have reviewed the applicability of the BEAT provisions to our transactions and we do not expect to be subject to BEAT and have not recorded any provision for BEAT in the year ended December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Under the new GILTI regime, earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of an allowable return on the subsidiary s tangible assets are required to be included in our U.S. taxable income.
884219_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to assess the impact and have not recorded a provision for the GILTI tax in the year ended December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act under U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants who do not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act.
884219_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent that a company s accounting is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	We have not completed the detailed accounting for all of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, specifically the BEAT and GILTI taxes, since the computations are complex and we need additional time to complete a full analysis.
884219_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Under SAB 118, we recorded a provisional estimate for the mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary E P of $8.1 million and the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
884219_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date and we expect to complete the detailed accounting and include any adjustments within this period.
884219_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:
884219_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Significant components of the income tax provision from continuing operations are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	We are subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which we operate.
884219_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate is as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	* Includes $0.6 million increase to the valuation allowance related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the reduction in U.S. tax rate.
884219_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	We use significant judgment in forming conclusions regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and evaluate all available positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	To the extent recovery does not appear likely, a valuation allowance must be recorded.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	We had gross deferred tax assets of $38.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and $58.3 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S2	These deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S3	As of December 31, 2017, foreign tax credit carryforwards were $0.4 million, of which $0.1 million are U.S. foreign tax credits and $0.3 million are United Kingdom foreign tax credits.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S4	The U.S. foreign tax credits are subject to a 10-year carryforward period and will expire in 2021.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $6.2 million that will be fully utilized against future tax liabilities before becoming refundable as allowed under the Tax Act.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S6	We had gross state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $68.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and $63.0 million as of December 31, 2016, for which we had deferred tax assets of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S7	The state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates from 2018 through 2038.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S8	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the valuation allowance was $4.0 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P130_S9	During 2017, we had a $1.6 million decrease on German foreign net operating loss carryforwards, offset by a $0.3 million increase for the United Kingdom foreign tax credits (although subject to an indefinite carryforward period, do not meet the more likely-than-not threshold for recognition), a $0.5 million increase for the state net operating loss return to provision true up, a $0.6 million increase due to the remeasurement for the reduction in U.S. tax rate, and a $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange.
884219_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	While we believe that the deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances, will be utilized in future periods, there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	It is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change, which could result in a material increase or decrease in our valuation allowance.
884219_18_ITEM8_P131_S2	Such a change could result in a material increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period the assessment was made.
884219_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	We have not recorded deferred taxes for certain states or foreign withholding taxes on certain historical unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands as we intend to reinvest those earnings in operations outside of the United States.
884219_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	We exercise judgment in determining the income tax provision for positions taken on prior returns when the ultimate tax d etermination is uncertain.
884219_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	We classify liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets unless expected to be paid or released within one year.
884219_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	We had liabilities associated with uncertain ta x positions, including interest and penalties, of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and $2.7 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of income tax expense.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	During 2017, we decreased the liability for continuing operations uncertain tax positions by $0.1 million due to lapse of statute and we increased accrued interest and penalties for continuing operations positions by $0.1 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	We expect $1.3 million of the continuing operations uncertain tax positions to be resolved or settled within the next twelve months and have classified this amount as a current liability.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S3	During 2017, we released the liability for discontinued operations uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million, including $0.4 million in accrued interest and penalties, due to a statute expiration, which was recorded through discontinued operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S4	We had liabilities associated with discontinued operations uncertain tax positions of zero as of December 31, 2017 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P134_S5	A reconciliation of the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (excluding interest and penalties) is as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	We are subject to regular and recurring audits by taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or have operated in the past, including various foreign countries in addition to the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
884219_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	Our 2014 through 2017 U.S. federal tax years and various state tax years from 2013 through 2017 remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P135_S2	Tax years 2012 through 2017 remain subject to examination by various foreign taxing jurisdictions.
884219_18_ITEM8_P135_S3	Cash paid for income taxes was $14.6 million during 2017, $14.1 million during 2016, and $10.1 million during 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	We have frozen defined benefit pension plans held in trust for certain employees which we funded.
884219_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	We also maintain certain unfunded defined benefit pension plans which provide supplemental benefits to select management employees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P136_S2	These plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	We also have certain defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees, retirees, and dependents.
884219_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	The related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P138_S1	In addition, we retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses.
884219_18_ITEM8_P138_S2	While the plans have no funding requirements, we may fund the plans.
884219_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) of our pension plans consist of the fol lowing:
884219_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) of our postretirement benefit plans consist of the following:
884219_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	The following table indicates the funded status of the plans as of December 31:
884219_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	The net amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption Pension and postretirement benefits as of December 31 are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	Amounts recognized in AOCI as of December 31 are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2018 is approximately $0.2 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P144_S1	The estimated prior service credit for the postretirement benefit plans that is expected to be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit credit in 2018 is approximately $0.2 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P144_S2	The estimated net actuarial loss that is expected to be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2018 is approximately $0.1 million for the unfunded benefit plans and $0.4 million for the funded benefit plans.
884219_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	The fair value of the domestic plans assets by asset class are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income securities is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
884219_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
884219_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	Furthermore, equity securities are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth and value.
884219_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	We utilize a building-block approach in determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
884219_18_ITEM8_P149_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
884219_18_ITEM8_P149_S3	The long-term portfolio return also considers diversification and rebalancing.
884219_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed relative to our assumed rates for reasonableness and appropriateness.
884219_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following pension and postretirement benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
884219_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Foreign Pension Plans Certain of our foreign operations also maintain defined benefit pension plans held in trust for certain employees which are funded by the companies, and unfunded defined benefit pension plans providing supplemental benefits to select management employees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	These plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation.
884219_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable re gulations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) included the following:
884219_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following table represents the funded status of the plans as of December 31:

884219_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	Net actuarial losses for the foreign funded plans recognized in AOCI were $2.5 million ($1.8 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2017 and $3.3 million ($2.5 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	Net actuarial losses for the foreign unfunded plans recognized in AOCI were $0.7 million ($0.5 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2017 and $0.4 million ($0.3 million after-tax) as of December 31, 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	The fair valu e information related to the foreign pension plans assets is summarized in the following tables:
884219_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:
884219_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	Information for Pension Plans with an Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets The accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	Contributions In aggregate for both the domestic and foreign plans, we anticipate contributing $1.1 million to the funded pension plans, $1.0 million to the unfunded pension plans, and $1.1 million to the postretirement benefit plans in 2018.
884219_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	Weighted-Average Assumptions Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs as of December 31 were as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2017 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%, declining one-third percent each year to the ultimate rate of 4.5% by the year 2026 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the December 31, 2016 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.0%, declining one-quarter percent each year to the ultimate rate of 4.5% by the year 2026 and remaining at that level thereafter.
884219_18_ITEM8_P164_S2	A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $1.4 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P164_S3	A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $1.1 million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately $0.1 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	Multi-employer Plans We contribute to defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S1	The financial risks of participating in these multi-employer pension plans generally include the fact that assets contributed to the plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S2	Furthermore, if a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S3	In addition, if we were to discontinue participating in some of our multi-employer pension plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S4	We also contribute to defined contribution plans pursuant to collective-bargaining agreements, which are generally not subject to the funding risks inherent in defined benefit pension plans.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S5	The overall level of contributions to our multi-employer plans may significantly vary from year to year based on the demand for union-represented labor to support our operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P165_S6	We do not have any minimum contribution requirements for future periods pursuant to our collective-bargaining agreements for individually significant multi-employer plans.
884219_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	Our participation in multi-employer pension plans for 2017 is outlined in the following table.
884219_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Pr otection Act zone status available in 2017 and 2016 relates to the plan s year end as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is based on information received from the plan.
884219_18_ITEM8_P166_S2	Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% fu nded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.
884219_18_ITEM8_P166_S3	The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan is either pending o r has been implemented.
884219_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	Other Employee Benefits We match U.S. employee contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of our common stock held in treasury up to 100% of the first 3% of a participant s salary plus 50% of the next 2%.
884219_18_ITEM8_P167_S1	The expense associated with our match was $4.2 million for 2017, $3.9 million for 2016, and $3.7 million for 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	Restructuring Charges GES Consolidation We have taken certain restructuring actions designed to reduce our cost structure primarily within GES, as well as the elimination of certain positions at the corporate office.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S1	We implemented a strategic reorganization plan in order to consolidate the separate business units within GES U.S.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S2	We also consolidated facilities and streamlined our operations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S3	As a result, we recorded restructuring charges in 2017, 2016, and 2015, primarily consisting of severance and related benefits as a result of workforce reductions and charges related to the consolidation and downsizing of facilities representing the remaining operating lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income) and related costs.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S4	Other Restructurings We recorded restructuring charges in connection with the consolidation of certain support functions at our corporate headquarters and certain reorganization activities within Pursuit.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S5	These charges primarily consist of severance and related benefits due to headcount reductions and charges related to the downsizing of facilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P168_S6	Changes to the restructuring liability by major restructuring activity are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the liabilities related to severance and employee benefits are expected to be paid by the end of 2018.
884219_18_ITEM8_P169_S1	Additionally, the liability related to future lease payments will be paid over the remaining lease terms for GES.
884219_18_ITEM8_P169_S2	Refer to Note 22 Segment Information, for information regarding restructuring charges by segment.
884219_18_ITEM8_P170_S0	Leases and Other We entered into operating leases for the use of certain of our offices, equipment, and other facilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P170_S1	These leases expire over periods up to 40 years.
884219_18_ITEM8_P170_S2	Leases which expire are generally renewed or replaced by similar leases.
884219_18_ITEM8_P170_S3	Some leases contain scheduled rental increases accounted for on a straight-line basis.
884219_18_ITEM8_P170_S4	As of December 31, 2017, our future minimum rental payments and related sublease rentals receivable with respect to non-cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year were as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P171_S0	Net rent expense under operating leases consisted of the following:
884219_18_ITEM8_P172_S0	The aggregate annual maturities and the related amounts representing interest on capital lease obligations are included in Note 11 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P172_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $38.1 million related to various licensing agreements, consulting and other contracted services.
884219_18_ITEM8_P173_S0	Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other We are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions, proceedings, and pending claims, some of which involve, or may involve, compensatory, punitive, or other damages.
884219_18_ITEM8_P173_S1	Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings, or claims could be decided against us.
884219_18_ITEM8_P173_S2	Although the amount of liability as of December 31, 2017 with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, we believe that any resulting liability, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S0	We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which we have or had operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and we could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S2	As is the case with many companies, we also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to our past operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded environmental remediation liabilities of $2.4 million related to previously sold operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S4	Although we are a party to certain environmental disputes, we believe that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S5	As of December 31, 2017, on behalf of our subsidiaries, we had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S6	These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities entered into by our subsidiary operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S7	We would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S8	The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of December 31, 2017 would be $19.3 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S9	These guarantees relate to our leased facilities through October 2027.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S10	There are no recourse provisions that would enable us to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P174_S11	Furthermore, there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby we could recover payments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	A significant number of our employees are unionized and we are a party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S1	If we are unable to reach an agreem ent with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our business and results of operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are s atisfactory and that collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2018 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse effect on our operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S3	We entered into showsite and warehouse agreements with the Chicago Te amsters Local 727, effective January 1, 2014, and those agreements contain provisions that allow the parties to re-open negotiation of the agreements on pension-related issues.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S4	We are in informal discussions regarding those issues with all relevant parties to resolve those issues in a manner that will be reasonable and equitable to employees, customers, and shareholders.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S5	Although our labor relations are currently stable, disruptions pending the outcome of the Chicago Teamsters Local 727 negotiations could o ccur, as they could with any collective-bargaining agreement negotiation, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of GES.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S6	Our business contributes to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees.
884219_18_ITEM8_P175_S7	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, we believe that several of these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
884219_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status.
884219_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by us, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require us to make payments to such plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P176_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the amount of additional funding, if any, that we would be required to make related to multi-employer pension plans is not ascertainable.
884219_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	We are self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation, employee health benefits, automobile, product and general liability, and property loss claims.
884219_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to our retention limit) related to our continuing operations was $19.1 million as of December 31, 2017 which includes $13.8 million related to workers compensation liabilities, and $5.3 million related to general/auto liability claims.
884219_18_ITEM8_P177_S2	We have also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses of $2.9 million as of December 31, 2017, related to workers compensation liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on our historical experience, claims frequency, and other factors.
884219_18_ITEM8_P178_S1	A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities.
884219_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	We have purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from $0.2 million to $0.5 million on a per claim basis.
884219_18_ITEM8_P179_S1	We do not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement.
884219_18_ITEM8_P179_S2	Our net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were $5.5 million for 2017, $5.0 million for 2016, and $5.6 million for 2015.
884219_18_ITEM8_P179_S3	In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we have recorded insurance liabilities of $10.4 million related to continuing operations, which represents the amount for which we remain the primary obligor after self-insured insurance limits, without taking into consideration the above-referenced insurance coverage.
884219_18_ITEM8_P179_S4	Of this total, $6.9 million related to workers compensation liabilities and $3.5 million related to general/auto liability claims which are recorded in other deferred items and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding receivable in other investments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	On November 3, 2017, we acquired the controlling interest (54.5% of the common stock) in Esja, a private corporation in Reykjavik, Iceland, which is developing and will operate a new FlyOver Iceland attraction.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Esja acquisition contains a put option that gives the minority Esja shareholders the right to sell (or put ) their Esja shares to us based on a multiple of 5.0x EBITDA as calculated on the trailing 12 months from the most recently completed quarter before the put option exercise.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S2	The put option is only exercisable after 36 months of business operation (the Reference Date ) and if the FlyOver Iceland attraction has earned a minimum of 3.25 million in unadjusted EBITDA during the most recent fiscal year and during the trailing 12-month period prior to exercise (the Put Option Condition ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S3	The put option is exercisable during a period of 12 months following the Reference Date (the Option Period ) and if the Put Option Condition has been met.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S4	If the Put Option Condition has not been met during the first Option Period, the Reference Date will be extended for an additional 12 months up to three times.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S5	If after 72 months, the FlyOver Iceland attraction has not achieved the Put Option Condition, the put option expires.
884219_18_ITEM8_P180_S6	If the Put Option Condition is met during any of the Option Periods, yet the shares are not exercised prior to the end of the 12-month Option Period, the put option will expire.
884219_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The noncontrolling interests carrying value is determined by the fair market value at acquisition and the subsequent noncontrolling interests share of net income or loss.
884219_18_ITEM8_P181_S1	This value is benchmarked against the redemption value of the sellers put option.
884219_18_ITEM8_P181_S2	The carrying value is adjusted to the latter, provided that it does not fall below the initial carrying values, as determined by the purchase price allocation.
884219_18_ITEM8_P181_S3	We have made a policy election to reflect any changes caused by such an adjustment in retained earnings, rather than in current earnings.
884219_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	Changes in redeemable n oncontrolling interests are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	We measure the profit and performance of our operations on the basis of segment operating income which excludes restructuring charges and impairment charges and recoveries.
884219_18_ITEM8_P183_S1	Intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and intersegment transfers are not significant.
884219_18_ITEM8_P183_S2	Corporate activities include expenses not allocated to operations.
884219_18_ITEM8_P183_S3	Depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense are the only significant non-cash items for the reportable segments.
884219_18_ITEM8_P183_S4	Our reportable segments, with reconciliations to consolidated totals, are as follows:
884219_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	Corporate eliminations during 2017 represent the elimination of depreciation expense recorded by Pursuit associated with previously eliminated intercompany profit realized by GES for renovations to Pursuit s Banff Gondola.
884219_18_ITEM8_P184_S1	Corporate eliminations recorded during 2016 represent the elimination of intercompany revenue and profit realized by GES for work completed on renovations to Pursuit s Banff Gondola.
884219_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	The 2016 amount includes an intercompany elimination for work completed by GES on renovations to Pursuit s Banff Gondola.
884219_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	Geographic Areas Our foreign operations are located principally in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.
884219_18_ITEM8_P187_S0	GES revenue is designated as domestic or foreign based on the originating location of the product or service.
884219_18_ITEM8_P187_S1	Long-lived assets are attributed to domestic or foreign based principally on the physical location of the assets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P187_S2	Long-lived assets consist of Property and equipment, net and Other investments and assets.
884219_18_ITEM8_P187_S3	The table below presents the financial information by major geographic area:
884219_18_ITEM8_P188_S0	Common Stock Repurchases We previously announced our Board of Directors authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices.
884219_18_ITEM8_P188_S1	No open market repurchases were made during 2017 or 2016.
884219_18_ITEM8_P188_S2	During 2015, we repurchased 141,462 shares on the open market for $3.8 million.
884219_18_ITEM8_P188_S3	As of December 31, 2017, 440,540 shares remain available for repurchase.
884219_18_ITEM8_P188_S4	We repurchased 41,532 shares for $2.1 million in 2017, 25,432 shares for $0.7 million in 2016, and 35,649 shares for $1.0 million in 2015 related to tax withholding requirements on vested share-based awards.
884219_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	The following table sets forth selected unaudited consolidated quarterly financial information:
884219_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	Represents revenue less costs of services and cost of products sold.
884219_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	The sum of quarterly income per share amounts may not equal annual income per share due to rounding.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viad Corp Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S3	Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S8	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S9	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S10	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM8_P192_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since at least 1929, however the specific year has not been determined.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, our management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
884219_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued a report relating to our audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which appears on the following page of this 2017 Form 10-K.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viad Corp and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P7_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
884219_18_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
