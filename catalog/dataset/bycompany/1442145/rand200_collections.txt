1442145_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Verisk Analytics, Inc. enables risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of detailed actuarial and underwriting data pertaining to United States, or U.S., property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P C insurance, healthcare and mortgage industries, and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to health insurance.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2010, our U.S. customers included all of the top 100 P C insurance providers, numerous health plans and third-party administrators, five of the six leading mortgage insurers, and 16 of the top 20 mortgage lenders.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	We believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We help those businesses address what we believe are the four primary decision making processes essential for managing risk as set forth below in the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework:
1442145_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	These four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers operations:
1442145_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims departments, independent adjustors and contractors.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented approximately 70.0% of our revenues in 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we had revenues of $1,138.3 million and net income of $242.6 million.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	For the five year period ended December 31, 2010, our revenues and net income grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate, or CAGR, of 11.7% and 14.9%, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	To further expand our Decision Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In 2004, we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	compliance and decision support solutions for the U.S. mortgage industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	In 2006, to bolster our position in the claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our senior management operating team, which includes our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, general counsel, and three senior officers who lead our business units, have been with us for an average of almost twenty years.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	Verisk Class A common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our Risk Analysis Framework: loss prediction and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our customers include most of the P C insurance providers in the U.S.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	To meet their needs, we process and interface with state regulators on average over 4,000 filings each year, ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	1,100 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	For example, in the homeowner s line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for six basic coverages, 178 national endorsements, and 495 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Overall, we provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 25 lines of insurance.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on approximately 3.0 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on approximately 5.8 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	We have a staff of approximately 600 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	Each year, our field staff visits over 350,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 30 years.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 2.8 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	We maintain a database of over 15.8 billion statistical records, including approximately 5.9 billion commercial lines records and approximately 9.9 billion personal lines records.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We collect unit-transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our proprietary quality process includes almost 2,500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We provide actuarial services to help our customers price their risks as they underwrite.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	We provide loss costs by coverage, class, territory, and many other categories.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S4	Our customers can use our estimates of future loss costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S5	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our loss costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S6	We make a number of actuarial adjustments, including loss development and loss adjustment expenses before the data is used to estimate future loss costs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P28_S7	Our actuarial services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described below.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P C insurance customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	We distribute a number of actuarial products and offer flexible services to meet our customers needs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance, government agencies and real estate.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of our Risk Analysis Framework.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and quantify losses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	claimants or insurers) that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our database contains information on more than 700 million claims and is the world s largest database of claims information.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claim reports, more than 239,000 a day on average, across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of automobiles and property, improving the chances of recovering those items; a service that helps owners and insurers recover stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment; an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are a leading provider of automated fraud detection, compliance and decision-support tools for the mortgage industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Utilizing our own loan level application database combined with actual mortgage loan performance data, we have established a risk scoring system which increases our customers ability to detect fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	We provide solutions that detect fraud through each step of the mortgage lifecycle and provide regulatory compliance solutions that perform instant compliance reviews of each mortgage application.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	Our fraud solutions can improve our customers profitability by predicting the likelihood that a customer account is experiencing fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	Our solution analyzes customer transactions in real time and generates recommendations for immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P40_S5	These applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and well-hidden to be identified by other methods.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification, which in turn requires us to identify, isolate and track mortgage applications through time.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Histories of multiple loans, both valid and fraudulent, are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	For this reason, unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data, their practicality is limited.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our proprietary database contains more than 18 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past ten years.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	This database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary third-party data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our solution provides a score, which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau, we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	We believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	We also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	We then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The recent turmoil in the mortgage industry has created an opportunity for growth in demand for our services, as we believe most mortgage insurers do not have the in-house capacity to respond to and properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	We offer solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect fraud, abuse and overpayment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our approach combines computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	We run our customers claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse, physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	This combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians, physicians practices, hospitals, dentists, and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	After a suspicious source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations, including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	By finding the individual claims with the most cost-recovery potential and also minimizing the number of false-positive indications of fraud, we enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high levels of customer service to their insurers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	We also offer web-based reporting tools that let payors take definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of fraudulent claims.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	The tools provide the documentation that helps to identify, investigate and prevent abusive and fraudulent activity by providers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in more than 50 countries.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	We are a leading provider of healthcare business intelligence and predictive modeling.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	We provide analytical and reporting systems to health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Those organizations use our solutions to review their healthcare data, including information on claims, membership, providers and utilization, and provide cost trends, forecasts and actuarial, financial and utilization analyses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	For example, our solutions allow our customers to predict medical costs and improve the financing and organization of health services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our predictive models help our customers identify high-cost cases for care- and disease-management intervention, compare providers adjusting for differences in health, predict resource use for individuals and populations, establish health-based and performance-based payments, negotiate payments and incentives, negotiate premium rates, and measure return on investment.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	We also provide our customers healthcare consulting services using complex clinical analyses to uncover reasons behind cost and utilization increases.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Physicians and hospitals are adopting and acquiring new technologies, drugs and devices more rapidly than ever before.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	We provide financial and actuarial consulting, clinical consulting, technical and implementation services and training services to help our customers manage costs and risks to their practices.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	We provide data, analytic and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	We provide solutions for every phase of a building s life, including:
1442145_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters, contractors and policyholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	To help our customers estimate repair costs, we also provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 467 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	We revise this information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 13,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we provide time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	We improve our pricing data by analyzing the actual claims experience of our customers to verify our estimates.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P59_S3	We estimate that more than 75.0% of all homeowners claims settled in the U.S. annually use our solution.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P59_S4	Such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	We also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. since 1950.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Over the past five years, we have grown our revenues at a CAGR of 11.7% through the successful execution of our business plan.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	These results reflect strong organic revenue growth, new product development and selected acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	We have made, and continue to make, investments in people, data sets, analytic solutions, technology, and complementary businesses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	The key components of our strategy include:
1442145_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	We expect to expand the application of our solutions in insurance customers internal risk and underwriting processes.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Building on our deep knowledge of, and embedded position in, the insurance industry, we expect to sell more solutions to existing customers tailored to individual insurance segments.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	By increasing the breadth and relevance of our offerings, we believe we can strengthen our relationships with customers and increase our value to their decision making in critical ways.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Develop New, Proprietary Data Sets and Predictive Analytics.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	We work with our customers to understand their evolving needs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	We plan to create new solutions by enriching our mix of proprietary data sets, analytic solutions and effective decision support across the markets we serve.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	We constantly seek to add new data sets that can further leverage our analytic methods, technology platforms and intellectual capital.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Leverage Our Intellectual Capital to Expand into Adjacent Markets and New Customer Sectors.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our organization is built on nearly four decades of intellectual property in risk management.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	We believe we can continue to profitably expand the use of our intellectual capital and apply our analytic methods in new markets, where significant opportunities for long-term growth exist.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	We have already demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy with our expansion into healthcare and non-insurance financial services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P64_S4	We also continue to pursue growth through targeted international expansion.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Pursue Strategic Acquisitions that Complement Our Leadership Positions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	We will continue to expand our data and analytics capabilities across industries.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	While we expect this will occur primarily through organic growth, we have and will continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The customers in our Risk Assessment segment include the top 100 P C insurance providers in the United States.

1442145_11_ITEM1_P66_S5	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Customer Relationships for more information on our relationship with our principal stockholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	In the Decision Analytics segment, we provide our P C insurance solutions to the majority of the P C insurers in the U.S.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Specifically, our claims database serves thousands of customers, representing nearly 93.0% of the P C insurance industry by premium volume, 26 state workers compensation insurance funds, 607 self-insurers, 455 third-party administrators, several state fraud bureaus, and many law-enforcement agencies involved in investigation and prosecution of insurance fraud.

1442145_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	We estimate that more than 80.0% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.

1442145_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We believe no single competitor currently offers the same scope of services and market coverage we provide.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	The breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment operates primarily in the U.S. P C insurance industry, where we enjoy a leading market presence.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	We have a number of competitors in specific lines or services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	We encounter competition from a number of sources, including insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Competitors also include other statistical agents, including the National Independent Statistical Service, the Independent Statistical Service and other advisory organizations, providing underwriting rules, prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the American Association of Insurance Services and Mutual Services Organization, although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys, including Overland Solutions, Inc. and Regional Reporting, Inc.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors including CDS, Inc., management and strategy consulting firms including Deloitte Consulting LLP, and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including Pinnacle Consulting and EMB.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	In the P C insurance claims market and catastrophe modeling market, certain products are offered by a number of companies, including Risk Management Solutions (catastrophe modeling), LexisNexis/ChoicePoint (loss histories and motor vehicle records for personal lines underwriting), MSB (property value and claims estimator), and Explore Information Services (personal automobile underwriting).
1442145_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	We believe that our P C insurance industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against these competitors with more limited offerings.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	In the healthcare market, certain products are offered by a number of companies, including Computer Sciences Corporation (evaluation of bodily injury and workers compensation claims), Fair Isaac Corporation (workers compensation and healthcare claims cost containment) and Ingenix, McKesson and Medstat (healthcare predictive modeling and business intelligence).
1442145_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	Competitive factors include application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and price.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	In the mortgage analytics solutions market, our competitors include CoreLogic and DataVerify Corporation (mortgage lending fraud identification).
1442145_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	We believe that none of our competitors in the mortgage analytics market offers the same combination of expertise in fraud detection analytics and forensic audit capabilities.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We take a market-focused team approach to developing our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our operating units are responsible for developing, reviewing and enhancing our various products and services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our data management and production team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production and quality control.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P76_S3	Our Enterprise Data Management, or EDM, team supports our efforts to create new information and products from available data and explores new methods of collecting data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P76_S4	EDM is focused on understanding and documenting business-unit and corporate data assets and data issues; sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise; creating an enterprise data strategy; facilitating research and product development; and promoting cross-enterprise communication.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our ISO Innovative Analytics, or IIA, team is a center of excellence inside the corporation for developing analytical methods in applying modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Our software development team builds the technology used in many of our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	As part of our product-development process, we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our products and services and the market s needs.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	We have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels, which meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P78_S3	In addition, we use frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and other industry forums to gather information to match the needs of the market with our product development efforts.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P78_S4	We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our clients and the markets in which they operate.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	We also add to our offerings through an active acquisition program.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	Since 2006, we have acquired 15 businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new products and enhance the value of existing products with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	We sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and sales support.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had a sales force of 268 people.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical product sets to targeted markets.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers, we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Tier One or National Accounts constitutes our largest customers, Tier Two or Strategic Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market carriers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	Tier Three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business and/or regional writers for a few states.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	A Sales Generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P83_S4	Our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Salespeople participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P84_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	Both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through six different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	These agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal, state and local governments.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S8	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P87_S9	Lastly, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Our costs of data received from our customers were 1.7% and 1.9% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,050 employees.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P89_S4	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and Orem, Utah.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units, including AIR and Verisk Health in Boston and AISG Claimsearch in Israel.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	In addition to these key data centers, we also have a number of smaller data centers located in other states.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P93_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P94_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P94_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we employed 4,706 full-time and 184 part-time employees.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	Our employees include over 200 actuarial professionals, including 43 Fellows and 27 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 143 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 17 Certified and 22 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and over 565 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P101_S2	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com .
1442145_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	To access these, click on the Financial Information SEC Filings link found on our Investor Relations homepage.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Specifically, all of our outstanding Class B common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers and provide us with a significant percentage of our data.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If the downturn in the U.S. insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 57% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Also, sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our revenue from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the U.S. mortgage market.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Revenue derived from solutions we provide the U.S. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our forensic audit business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 65% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Mortgage origination volumes in 2010 declined versus 2009 and may continue to decline based on the changes in the mortgage market related to the U.S. mortgage crisis.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The restructuring or elimination of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could have a negative effect on the U. S. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the U.S. mortgage crisis.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Two customers represent the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2010 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace them with new customers, our revenue may decline.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance services sector.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	European Union s Data Protection Directive and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, customers misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P40_S8	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities, lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost twenty years.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	However, with the exception of Frank J. Coyne, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are subject to antitrust and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust litigation.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our liquidity, financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in U.S. and international credit markets and economic conditions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, resulting in a contraction of available credit, even for the most credit-worthy borrowers.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Due to recent market events, our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In such an event, we may not be able to draw on all, or a substantial portion, of our uncommitted credit facilities, which would adversely affect our liquidity.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Also, if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or replacement of, our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	In addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Specifically, certain of our fraud identification and detection solutions are directed at the mortgage market.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the IPO and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 24,577,690 shares of our Class A common stock, primarily owned by our ESOP, 12,225,480 shares of our Class B (Series 1), or Class B-1, common stock and 14,771,340 shares of our Class B (Series 2), or Class B-2, common stock, representing in aggregate approximately 30.33% of our outstanding common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Certain members of our management are subject to lock-up agreements with us whereby they are not be permitted to sell any of their common stock, subject to certain conditions, for a period of time.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Restrictions under these lock-up agreements expire in part on April 6, 2011 and expire completely on October 6, 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Also, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Class B stockholders are not able to sell any of their common stock, subject to certain conditions, to the public for a period of time.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Each share of Class B-1 common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by the holder, into one share of Class A common stock on April 6, 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Each share of Class B-2 common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by the holder, into one share of Class A common stock on October 6, 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our board of directors may approve exceptions to the limitation on transfers of our Class B common stock in their sole discretion, in connection with the sale of such Class B common stock in a public offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in such other limited circumstances as our board of directors may determine.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Any Class B common stock sold to the public will first be converted to Class A common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Such further resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 23,018,745 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of February 25, 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have the right to elect up to three out of eleven of our directors and their interests in our business may be different than yours.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Until no Class B common stock remains outstanding, the holders of our Class B common stock will have the right to elect up to three of our directors.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	stock, or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of Class A stockholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	For example, holders of our Class B common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or the use of our solutions, but which might involve risks to holders of our Class A common stock, including a potential decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2010, our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 22 states in the United States and the District of Columbia, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Canada, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, and Nepal.
1442145_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because many of these cases remain in their early stages and only limited discovery has taken place.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend the litigation proceedings described below, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Hensley, et al. v. Computer Sciences Corporation et al. was a putative nationwide class action complaint, filed in February 2005, in Miller County, Arkansas state court.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	Defendants include numerous insurance companies and providers of software products used by insurers in paying claims.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	We are among the named defendants.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Plaintiffs allege that certain software products, including our Claims Outcome Advisor product and a competing software product sold by Computer Sciences Corporation, improperly estimated the amount to be paid by insurers to their policyholders in connection with claims for bodily injuries.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	We entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs asserting claims relating to the use of Claims Outcome Advisor by defendants Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive Car Insurance and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Each of these settlements was granted final approval by the court and together the settlements resolve the claims asserted in this case against us with respect to the above insurance companies, who settled the claims against them as well.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	A provision was made in 2006 for this proceeding and the total amount we paid in 2008 with respect to these settlements was less than $2.0 million.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	A fourth defendant, The Automobile Club of California, which is alleged to have used Claims Outcome Advisor, was dismissed from the action.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	On August 18, 2008, pursuant to the agreement of the parties the Court ordered that the claims against us be dismissed with prejudice.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	Subsequently, Hanover Insurance Group made a demand for reimbursement, pursuant to an indemnification provision contained in a December 30, 2004 License Agreement between Hanover and the Company, of its settlement and defense costs in the Hensley class action.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	Specifically, Hanover demanded $2.5 million including $0.6 million in attorneys fees and expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	We dispute that Hanover is entitled to any reimbursement pursuant to the License Agreement.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	resolve the dispute in mediation, Hanover served a summons and complaint seeking indemnity and contribution from us.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	The following two lawsuits have been filed by or on behalf of groups of Louisiana insurance policyholders who claim, among other things, that certain insurers who used products and price information supplied by our Xactware subsidiary (and those of another provider) did not fully compensate policyholders for property damage covered under their insurance policies.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	The plaintiffs seek to recover compensation for their damages in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the defendants and the fair market repair/restoration costs of their damaged property.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	Schafer v. State Farm Fire Cas. Co. , et al. was a putative class action pending against us and State Farm Fire Casualty Company filed in March 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P9_S1	The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P9_S2	The court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against us other than fraud, which will proceed to the discovery phase along with the remaining claims against State Farm.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P9_S3	Judge Duval denied plaintiffs motion to certify a class with respect to the fraud and breach of contract claims on August 3, 2009 and the time to appeal that decision has expired.

1442145_11_ITEM3_P10_S2	As in Schafer, the court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against us other than fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P10_S3	Judge Duval stayed all proceedings in the case pending an appraisal of the lead plaintiff s insurance claim.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P10_S4	The matter has been re-assigned to Judge Barbier, who on September 11, 2009 issued an order administratively closing the matter pending completion of the appraisal process.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P10_S5	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter.

1442145_11_ITEM3_P11_S2	The class complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DPPA, punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained personal information.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P11_S3	The Court granted iiX s motion to dismiss the complaint based on failure to state a claim and for lack of standing.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P11_S4	Oral arguments on the plaintiffs appeal of that dismissal were held on November 4, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P11_S5	The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the District Court s dismissal of the complaint on July 14, 2010.

1442145_11_ITEM3_P14_S0	Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 17, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM3_P14_S1	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to these matters.

1442145_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 47.6% and 51.0% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our Decision Analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework: Loss Prediction, Fraud Identification and Detection, and Loss Quantification.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 52.4% and 49.0% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	We use year over year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures, see Note 4 within Item 6.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Selected Financial Data included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud solution or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan, obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 30.2% and 29.0% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P18_S4	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Approximately 84.0% and 83.8% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Approximately 56.8% and 57.7% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Personnel expenses include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs (described under Equity Compensation Costs below), sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs, which represented 65.4% and 67.6% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	The higher percentage of personnel expenses in 2009 is primarily related to the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred prior to our initial IPO.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	The accelerated ESOP allocation resulted in a one time, non-cash charge of $57.7 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	Excluding this accelerated ESOP allocation, personnel expenses represented 64.8% of our total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	We have acquired six businesses since January 1, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, our consolidated results of operations may not be comparable between periods.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The acquisitions noted below are all integrated within our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	On December 16, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock of 3E Company, or 3E, a global source for a comprehensive suite of environmental health and safety compliance solutions for a net cash purchase price of approximately $107.3 million, of which $7.7 million was used to fund indemnity escrows.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	We are still evaluating the allocation of purchase price.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Within our Decision Analytics segment, 3E overlaps the customer sets served by our other supply chain risk management solutions and helps our customers across a variety of vertical markets address their environmental health and safety issues.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	On December 14, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Crowe Paradis Services Corporation, or CP, a leading provider of claims analysis and compliance solutions for the property/casualty insurance industry, for a net cash purchase price of approximately $90.3 million, of which $6.8 million was used to fund indemnity escrows.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	We are still evaluating the allocation of purchase price.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	and self-insured companies which enhances solutions we currently offer.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	On February 26, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Strategic Analytics, Inc., or SA, a privately owned provider of credit risk and capital management solutions to consumer and mortgage lenders, for a net cash purchase price of $7.9 million of which $1.5 million was used to fund indemnity escrows.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, SA s solutions and application set will allow our customers to take advantage of state-of-the-art loss forecasting, stress testing, and economic capital requirement tools to better understand and forecast the risk associated within their credit portfolios.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the purchase allocation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	On October 30, 2009, we acquired the net assets of Enabl-u Technology Corporation, Inc, or Enabl-u, a privately owned provider of data management, training and communication solutions to companies with regional, national or global work forces.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We believe this acquisition will enhance our ability to provide solutions for customers to measure loss prevention and improve asset management through the use of software and software services.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	On July 24, 2009, we acquired the net assets of TierMed Systems, LLC, or TierMed, a privately owned provider of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, solutions to healthcare organizations that have HEDIS or quality-reporting needs.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe this acquisition will enhance our ability to provide solutions for customers to measure and improve healthcare quality and financial performance through the use of software and software services.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	On January 14, 2009, we acquired 100% of the stock of D2 Hawkeye, Inc., or D2, a privately-owned provider of data mining, decision support, clinical quality analysis, and risk analysis tools for the healthcare industry.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	We believe this acquisition will enhance our position in the healthcare analytics and predictive modeling market by providing new market, cross-sell, and diversification opportunities for the Company s expanding healthcare solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have a leveraged ESOP, funded with intercompany debt that includes 401(k), ESOP and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	We make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	As the debt is repaid, shares are released to the ESOP to fund 401(k) matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants eligible compensation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the ESOP.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:
1442145_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	In connection with our IPO, on October 6, 2009, we accelerated our future ESOP allocation contribution through the end of the ESOP in 2013, to all participants eligible for a contribution in 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	This resulted in a non-recurring non-cash charge of approximately $57.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	As a result, subsequent to the offering, the non-cash ESOP allocation expense was substantially reduced for future periods.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	Excluding the ESOP allocation, expense relating specifically to our 401(k) and profit sharing plans were $11.6 million, $8.7 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	In addition, the portion of the ESOP allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the ESOP above the value of those shares when the ESOP was first established is not tax deductible.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Prior to our IPO, we granted to key employees nonqualified stock options covered under the Insurance Services Office, Inc. 1996 Incentive Plan, or the Option Plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Subsequent to the IPO, nonqualified stock options granted to key employees are covered under the Verisk Analytics, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, the Incentive Plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	All of the Company s outstanding stock options are covered under the Incentive Plan or the Option Plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	See Stock-Based Compensation section within our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 16 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Prior to our IPO, our Class A stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date, as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the Company.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on October 6, 2009, we are no longer obligated to redeem Class A stock and therefore are not required to present our Class A stock and vested stock options at redemption value.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	The reversal of the redeemable common stock of $1,064.9 million on October 6, 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of $440.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million to Class A common stock at par value, an increase of $624.3 million to additional paid-in-capital, and a reclassification of the ISO Class A unearned common stock shares balance within the ISO 401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or KSOP, of $1.3 million to unearned KSOP contributions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	See Note 14 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Beginning in 2008, our selling, general and administrative costs increased as we prepared for our IPO.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	These costs were $7.0 million and $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and negatively affected our EBITDA margins by 0.7% for each of the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	costs related to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and increased director and officer insurance premiums.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Revenues were $1,138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1,027.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $111.2 million or 10.8%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	In 2010 and the latter half of 2009, we acquired five companies, TierMed, Enabl-u, Strategic Analytics, CP, and 3E, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Recent acquisitions provided an increase of $10.5 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $100.7 million, which included an increase in our Risk Assessment segment of $18.1 million and an increase in our Decision Analytics segment of $82.6 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for further information regarding our revenues.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Cost of revenues was $463.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $491.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $27.8 million or 5.7%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	This decrease was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred in 2009, which resulted in the elimination of substantially all future ESOP allocation expense.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	In 2010 and 2009, our ESOP allocation expense for the year was $0.0 million and $51.9 million, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	The reduction in our cost of revenues was offset by recent acquisitions, which provided an increase of $6.4 million in cost for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 and the cost associated with our recent acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $17.7 million or 4.0%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $16.9 million; $4.1 million of data and consultants costs incurred in connection with the growth in our property-specific rating and underwriting information, and fraud identification and detection solutions; and other general expenses of $0.3 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	These increases in costs were partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in state employment tax credit and a reduction in office maintenance expense of $0.9 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The increase in salaries and employee benefits of $16.9 million includes an increase of $24.6 million in annual salaries and employee benefits such as medical costs and long-term incentive plan, and was partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in pension costs.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in salaries and benefit costs is related to a modest increase in employee headcount, primarily in Decision Analytics.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	The pension cost decreased $7.7 million primarily due to the partial recovery in 2009 of the fair value of our pension investments.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA, were $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $162.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $3.8 million or 2.3%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 of $15.4 million and costs associated with our recent acquisitions of $4.8 million, SGA increased $14.4 million or 9.8%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $14.4 million, which includes annual salary increases, medical costs, commissions, and long-term incentive plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P49_S3	Other increases were costs related to advertising and marketing of $2.5 million and other general expenses of $2.1 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P49_S4	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal costs primarily related to our IPO in 2009 of $2.8 million and a reduction in pension cost of $1.8 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.1 million or 5.6%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets includes depreciation of furniture and equipment, software, computer hardware, and related equipment.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The majority of the increase relates to software and hardware costs to support data capacity expansion and revenue growth.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Amortization of intangible assets was $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5.2 million or 16.0%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	This decrease was primarily related to a decrease of $6.3 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions that have been fully amortized; partially offset by $1.1 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Acquisition related liabilities adjustment was a benefit of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010; there was no such adjustment in 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	This benefit was as a result of a reduction of $0.5 million to contingent consideration due to the reduced probability of TierMed, a recent acquisition, achieving the EBITDA and revenue earnout targets set at the time of the acquisition.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Investment income and realized gains/(losses) on securities, net, was a gain of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.5 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Interest expense was $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $0.6 million or 1.7%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	This decrease was primarily due to reduced interest costs as a result of a decrease in average debt outstanding of approximately $605 million in 2010 compared to approximately $650 million in 2009, coupled with a decrease in our interest rate on borrowings from our syndicated revolving credit facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The decrease in borrowing rate was the result of an amendment to the facility on September 10, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the syndicated credit facility, which had been entered into in July of 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The provision for income taxes was $164.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $138.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $26.1 million or 18.9%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The effective tax rate was 40.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	The effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses in 2010 versus 2009 related to the KSOP.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our EBITDA margin does not reflect any ESOP allocation expense in 2010 due to the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred in 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The ESOP allocation expense of $67.3 million in 2009 negatively impacted our 2009 EBITDA margin by approximately 6.6%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	For our 2010 EBITDA margin, a decrease in pension costs of $9.5 million positively impacted our margin by approximately 0.8%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Revenues were $542.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $524.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $18.1 million or 3.5%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The overall increase within this segment primarily resulted from an increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the content of our industry-standard insurance programs solutions and the addition of new customers.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The increase of $5.0 million or 3.8% within property-specific rating and underwriting information revenues is due partially to growth in property appraisal solutions and community rating services.

1442145_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees received in advance).
1442145_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Our capital expenditures, which include non-cash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations, as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 3.6%, 4.3%, and 3.7%, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	We estimate our capital expenditures for 2011 will be approximately $60.0 million, which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	The amounts capitalized in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed , are not significant to the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 we repurchased and redeemed $422.3 million, $46.7 million and $392.6 million, respectively, of our common stock.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Included in the 2010 share repurchases are repurchases of $209.8 million of Class B, including $199.9 million and $9.9 million of Verisk Class B-1 and Class B-2, respectively, which were not a part of the Repurchase Program.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	A substantial portion of the share redemption included in the total above was completed pursuant to the terms of the Insurance Service Office, Inc. 1996 Incentive Plan, or the Option Plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	Based on the pension funding policy, we expect to contribute approximately $25.8 million to the pension plan in 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Under the postretirement plan, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	We expect to contribute approximately $4.2 million to the postretirement plan in 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	We had total debt, excluding capital lease and other obligations, of $835.0 million and $585.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	The debt at December 31, 2010 was held under long-term loan facilities drawn to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our $575 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility due September 2014, or credit facility, is a committed facility, where as all of our long-term loan facilities are uncommitted facilities.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	We have financed and expect to finance our short-term working capital needs, stock repurchases and acquisition contingent payments through cash from operations and borrowings from a combination of our long-term facilities and our credit facility.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	On January 19, 2010 and January 25, 2010, we repaid $10.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, of our outstanding borrowings from the credit facility.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	On September 10, 2010, we amended our credit facility to increase the capacity by $155.0 million to $575.0 million, to extend the maturity of the credit facility to September 10, 2014 and to modify certain restrictions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	We paid a one-time fee of $1.8 million, reduced our ongoing unused facility fees from 0.375% to 0.200% and reduced our borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	The one-time fee will be amortized over a four-year period, which is consistent with the remaining life of the credit facility.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S4	We had borrowings of $310.0 million and $60.0 million from our credit facility outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S5	We had available capacity of $263.0 million from our credit facility at December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P109_S6	Upon completion of our follow-on offering on October 1, 2010, we funded a portion of our share repurchase with proceeds from borrowings of $160.0 million under our credit facility of which we have repaid $105.0 million as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	December 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, respectively, with a portion of the proceeds from borrowings from our credit facility of $255.0 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	The $575 million credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	These covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, cross defaults, and certain transactions with affiliates.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of below 3.0 to 1.0.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	We also have long-term loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with Aviva Investors North America, or Aviva, New York Life and Prudential Capital Group, or Prudential, with capacities at December 31, 2010 in the amounts of $20.0 million, $30.0 million and $115.0 million, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	We can borrow under the Aviva Master Shelf Agreement until December 10, 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	On March 16, 2010, we amended the New York Life Master Shelf Agreement to increase the authorization of additional senior promissory notes from $100.0 million to $115.0 million, and to extend the maturity of the agreement through March 16, 2013.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	On August 30, 2010, we amended the Prudential Master Shelf Agreement to extend the maturity of the agreement through August 30, 2013.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	On June 15, 2009, we repaid our $100.0 million Prudential Series D senior notes.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	In order to pay the Prudential Series D senior notes, we issued Series J senior promissory notes under the uncommitted master shelf agreement with Prudential in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million due June 15, 2016 and borrowed $50.0 million from our revolving credit facility with Bank of America N.A. Interest on the Prudential Series J senior notes is payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 6.85% on the senior promissory notes.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	On April 27, 2009, we issued a senior promissory note under an uncommitted master shelf agreement with Aviva in the aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million due April 27, 2013.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Interest is payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 6.46%.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	The notes outstanding under these facilities mature over the next six years.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	Individual borrowings are made at a fixed rate of interest determined at the time of the borrowing and interest is payable quarterly.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	The weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 6.07% and 6.11% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The uncommitted master shelf agreements contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell assets to another company.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Aviva and New York Life Master Shelf Agreements also contain financial covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 275% during any period of four fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio of no more than 300% at the end of any fiscal quarter.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	The Prudential Master Shelf Agreement also contains financial covenants that require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a leverage ratio of no more than 300% at the end of any fiscal quarter.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
1442145_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $336.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	The increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers and a reduction in interest payments, partially offset by an increase in operating expense and tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	Increased pension contributions of $15.0 million in 2010, as well as the timing of certain annual bonus payments, mitigated the growth in our operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $247.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an increase in cash receipts of $141.5 million, a decrease in excess tax benefit from exercised stock options of $6.1 million, a decrease in payments of acquisition related liabilities of $1.9 million, and a decrease in salary and employee related payments of $10.2 million due to an additional pay-cycle that occurred in 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	Our payroll is processed on a bi-weekly basis thereby requiring an additional pay-cycle once every ten years.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P120_S3	This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in operating expense related payments of $63.6 million, an increase in tax payments of $12.1 million and an increase in interest payments of $5.2 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $243.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in acquisitions, including escrow funding, of $136.6 million partially offset by a decrease in earnout payments of $78.1 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	The increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to increased cash paid for acquisitions, including escrow funding, of $48.5 million and an increase in purchases of fixed assets of $8.0 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Net cash used in financing activities was $108.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	The increase in net cash used in financing activities can be attributed to an increase in share repurchases of $388.4 million primarily through our Repurchase Program and the shares repurchased as part of our follow-on public offering on October 1, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	The increase was partially offset by net debt receipts of $325.6 million and cash inflows from stock option exercises of $56.8 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Net cash used in financing activities was $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in the repurchases of stock of $345.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term and short-term debt of $312.5 million, a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $22.6 million and a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock options exercised of $6.1 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2010 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Other long-term liabilities consist of our ESOP contributions and employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $23.0 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, as we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $7.8 million.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P130_S3	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P130_S4	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P131_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S4	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S5	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P132_S6	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	On January 1, 2005, we adopted the new accounting standard for Share Based Payment using a prospective approach, which required us to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	As the majority of annual grants have a four year vesting term, the compensation expense for 2005 through 2007 is not comparable in subsequent periods, as there is no compensation expense recorded for the vesting of awards granted from 2002 through 2004.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	The following table illustrates the amount of annual compensation expense resulting from the implementation of this standard using the prospective approach for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	Option grants are expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock-based compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	the economic outlook in general, the condition of the specific industries in which we operate, the financial condition of the business, our ability to generate free cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible asset value.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies, including the use of the guideline company method.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	This determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis, which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable, in whole or in part, to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	These methodologies have been consistently applied since 1997.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	We regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies, including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis, the future forecasts of revenue and earnings, and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	These assumptions are reviewed quarterly, with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P141_S4	For the comparable company analysis, the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	As the number of shares outstanding has declined over time, our share price has increased.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	The determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P142_S3	If different assumptions are used in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P143_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P143_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_11_ITEM7_P143_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $832.9 million, which represents 68.4% of our total assets.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	During fiscal year 2010, we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2010 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	Neither our initial valuation nor our subsequent analysis have indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $632.7 million as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	As of December 31, 2009, we adopted the new disclosure requirements that require disclosures about pension plan assets including how investment allocation decisions are made; including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period and significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S3	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S4	For our pension plan at December 31, 2010, we determined this rate to be 5.49%, a decrease of 0.25% from the 5.74% rate used at December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P151_S5	Our postretirement rate is 4.00% at December 31, 2010, a decrease of 0.50% from the 4.50% used at December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	The expected return on plan assets of 8.25% as of December 31, 2010 is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P152_S1	Our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.0% debt securities and 60.0% equity securities.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P152_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the plan assets were allocated 42.0% debt, 56.0% equity securities, and 2.0% to other investments.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the pension plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P153_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P153_S3	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the Postretirement Plan.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P155_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P155_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	A one percent change in discount rate, future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects:
1442145_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	We follow ASC 740-10 guidance for accounting for income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	As a result of the implementation of this interpretation, we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.3 million, which was accounted for as an increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings/(accumulated deficit).
1442145_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2010 we have federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $60.8 million, which will expire at various dates from 2011 through 2030.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	The significant majority of the state net operating loss carryforwards were generated by a subsidiary that employs our internal staff as a result of favorable tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P162_S1	This subsidiary s state net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized as the subsidiary generates sufficient taxable income to utilize losses.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $4.9 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2011, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(r) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of $310.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.75%.
1442145_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2010, a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately $3.1 million based on our current level of borrowings.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Crowe Paradis Services Corporation ( CP ) and 3E Company ( 3E ), which were acquired on December 14, 2010 and December 16, 2010, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	The combined excluded financial statements of these two acquisitions constitute approximately 1.5% of total assets, less than 1.0% of total revenues, and less than 1.0% of net income included within our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for CP and 3E.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P9_S1	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Crowe Paradis Services Corporation ( CP ) and 3E Company ( 3E ), which were acquired on December 14, 2010 and December 16, 2010, respectively, and whose combined financial statements constitute approximately 1.5% of total assets, less than 1.0% of total revenues and less than 1.0% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at CP and 3E. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P11_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P12_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Verisk Analytics, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ( Verisk or the Company ) enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company provides its customers proprietary data that, combined with analytic methods, create embedded decision support solutions.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company provides solutions, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Verisk was established on May 23, 2008 to serve as the parent holding company of Insurance Services Office, Inc. ( ISO ) upon completion of the initial public offering ( IPO ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	ISO was formed in 1971 as an advisory and rating organization for the P C insurance industry to provide statistical and actuarial services, to develop insurance programs and to assist insurance companies in meeting state regulatory requirements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Over the past decade, the Company has broadened its data assets, entered new markets, placed a greater emphasis on analytics, and pursued strategic acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	On October 6, 2009, ISO effected a corporate reorganization whereby the Class A and Class B common stock of ISO were exchanged by the current stockholders for the common stock of Verisk on a one-for-one basis.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Verisk immediately thereafter effected a fifty-for-one stock split of its Class A and Class B common stock and equally sub-divided the Class B common stock into two new series of stock, Verisk Class B (Series 1) ( Class B-1 ) and Verisk Class B (Series 2) ( Class B-2 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	All share and per share information in the consolidated financial statements gives effect to the fifty-for-one stock split that occurred immediately after the reorganization.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	On October 9, 2009, the Company completed its IPO.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Upon completion of the IPO, the selling stockholders sold 97,995,750 shares of Class A common stock of Verisk, which included the 12,745,750 over-allotment option, at the IPO price of $22.00 per share.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P29_S4	Concurrent with the closing of this offering, the Company also repurchased 7,254,407 and 45,593 shares of Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock, respectively, at $26.3644 per share, which represents the net proceeds per share the selling stockholders received in the public offering.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P29_S5	The Company funded a portion of this repurchase with proceeds from borrowings of $160,000 under its syndicated revolving credit facility.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	compensation, liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits, fair value of the Company s redeemable common stock, and the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	Significant accounting policies include the following:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Verisk.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	The following describes the Company s primary types of revenues and the applicable revenue recognition policies.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales tax withholdings.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Industry-standard insurance programs, statistical agent and data services and actuarial services are sold to participating insurance company customers under annual agreements covering a calendar year where the price is determined at the inception of the agreement.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the term of these annual agreements, as services are performed and continuous access to information is provided over the entire term of the agreements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company provides property-specific rating information through reports issued for specific commercial properties, for which revenue is recognized when the report is delivered to the customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the assets undiscounted cash flows, the Company estimates an impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company leases various property, plant and equipment.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Leased property is accounted for under ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Accordingly, leased property that meets certain criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the options granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	On January 1, 2005, the Company adopted ASC 718 using a prospective approach, as required under ASC 718.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	Under this application, the Company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Prior to January 1, 2008, the expected term (estimated period of time outstanding) was estimated using the simplified method as defined in ASC 718, in which the expected term equals the average of graded vesting term and the contractual term.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	Subsequent to January 1, 2008, the expected term was primarily estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	However, certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise patterns exist, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	Expected volatility for awards prior to January 1, 2008 was based on the Company s historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected term, ending on the day of grant, and calculated on a quarterly basis for purposes of the ISO 401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( KSOP ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	For awards granted after January 1, 2008, the volatility factor was based on an average of the historical stock prices of a group of the Company s peers over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the stock option award.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P68_S3	Prior to 2008, the expected dividend yield was not included in the fair value calculation as the Company did not pay dividends.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P68_S4	For awards granted after January 1, 2008, the expected dividends yield was based on the Company s expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company estimates expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	Changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the requisite service period, and may impact the timing of expense recognized over the requisite service period.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Research and development costs, which primarily relate to the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in developing new services for our customers, are expensed as incurred.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	Such costs were $14,870, $14,109 and $11,054 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent these assets are more likely than not to be realized.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the potential deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company follows ASC 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10 ) , which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740-10 and in subsequent periods.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) are determined in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share , which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for EPS.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Basic EPS excludes all dilutive common stock equivalents.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	It is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	For purposes of calculating EPS, Class A, Class B-1 and Class B-2 common shares are combined since all classes have identical rights to earnings.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company accounts for its pension and postretirement benefits under ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits ( ASC 715 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	ASC 715 requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet, the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period, but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost, and the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, product warranty obligations were not significant.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby the Company indemnifies another party for breaches of confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property or gross negligence.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	Such indemnifications are primarily granted under licensing of computer software.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Most agreements contain provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications, however, the Company is not able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation, claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	Such estimates are based on management s judgment.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	Actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated, and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S4	The Company completed the required annual impairment test as of June 30, 2010, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill in 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S5	This test compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S6	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S7	If the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company will determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P83_S8	If the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of the goodwill.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts ( ASU No. 2010-28 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	ASU No. 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	ASU No. 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	The adoption of ASU No. 2010-28 will not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, and the Company will incorporate the provisions of this guidance as part of their Step 1 testing for goodwill impairment in 2011.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	In April 2010, the FASB ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition Milestone Method ( ASU No. 2010-17 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU No. 2010-17 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P87_S2	ASU 2010-17 is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P87_S3	Based on the Company s current agreements, ASU No. 2010-17 will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company does not typically perform research or development transactions.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASU No. 2010-06 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	ASU No. 2010-06 provides guidance on improving disclosures on fair value measurements, such as the transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs and the disaggregated activity in the rollforward for Level 3 fair value measurements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	ASU No. 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about the disaggregated activity in the rollforward for Level 3 fair value measurements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P88_S3	Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal periods.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The adoption of the portion of ASU No. 2010-06 that discusses the transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, effective January 1, 2010, did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	As the Company currently disaggregates the activity in the rollforward for Level 3 fair value measurements, they do not expect ASU No. 2010-06 to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU No. 2009-13 ).
1442145_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	ASU No. 2009-13 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	Specifically, ASU No. 2009-13 addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU No. 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	The Company has elected not to early adopt.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	ASU No. 2009-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as our Company s multiple deliverables arrangements are comprised primarily of software licenses and services, rather than hardware.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P91_S3	Currently, a majority of our deliverables do not have stand alone value, which would preclude the separation and allocation of the arrangement.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P91_S4	Therefore, the Company will continue to recognize revenue over the duration of the license term.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, available for sale securities and accounts receivable, which are generally not collateralized.

1442145_11_ITEM8_P259_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal Medicare subsidy.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P260_S0	The healthcare cost trend rate for 2010 was 9.0% gradually decreasing to 5.0% in 2018.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P260_S1	Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P260_S2	A 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P261_S0	The expected subsidy from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the Company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $7,514 and $8,394 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $474, $613 and $1,315 in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P262_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value measurements by level of the Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2010:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P263_S0	Valued at the closing price of shares for domestic stocks within the managed equity accounts, and valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) of shares for mutual funds at either the closing price reported in the active market or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings for corporate bonds held by the Plan in these managed accounts.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P264_S0	The pooled separate accounts invest in domestic and foreign stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P264_S1	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the pooled separate account, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P265_S0	Within managed equity accounts, when quoted prices are not available for identical or similar bonds, the bond is valued under a discounted cash flows approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P266_S0	Investments for which readily determinable prices do not exist are valued by the General Partner using either the market or income approach.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P267_S0	the underlying portfolio company, nature of investment, restrictions on marketability, holding period, market conditions, foreign currency exposures, and other factors the General Partner deems appropriate.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P268_S0	The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Pension Plan s Level 3 assets for the years ended December 31:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P269_S0	ASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( ASC 280-10 ), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P269_S1	ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P270_S0	Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P270_S1	The Company s CEO and Chairman of the Board is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280-10.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P270_S2	To align with the internal management of the Company s business operations based on service offerings, the Company is organized into the following two operating segments, which are also the Company s reportable segments:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P271_S0	Risk Assessment: The Company is the leading provider of statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P271_S1	The Company s databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P271_S2	The Company uses this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P272_S0	Decision Analytics: The Company develops solutions that its customers use to analyze the three key processes in managing risk: loss prediction, fraud identification and detection and loss quantification.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P272_S1	The Company s combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary data to generate solutions in each of these three categories.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P272_S2	In most cases, the Company s customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P273_S0	The Company develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P273_S1	The Company also develops solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P273_S2	Fraud solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of mortgage applications to identify misinformation, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance, mortgage and healthcare sectors.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P274_S0	The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments for which separate discrete financial information is available and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P274_S1	The Company uses segment EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P275_S0	Segment EBITDA is the measure of operating results used to assess corporate performance and optimal utilization of debt and acquisitions.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P275_S1	Segment operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P275_S2	Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P275_S3	The Company does not allocate investment income, realized gains/(losses) on securities, net, interest expense, or income tax expense, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P275_S4	The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P276_S0	On a geographic basis, no individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 1% or more of the Company s consolidated revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P276_S1	No individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 1% or more of total consolidated long-term assets as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P277_S0	The following tables provide the Company s revenue and operating income performance by reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as a reconciliation to income before income taxes for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P278_S0	Operating segment revenue by type of service is provided below:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P279_S0	The Company considers its Verisk Class A and Class B stockholders that own more than 5% of the outstanding stock within the respective class to be related parties as defined within ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures .
1442145_11_ITEM8_P279_S1	At December 31, 2010, the related parties were four Class B stockholders each owning more than 5% of the outstanding Class B shares compared to six Class B stockholders at December 31, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P279_S2	At December 31, 2010, there were four Class A stockholders owning more than 5% of the outstanding Class A shares.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P279_S3	The Company s related parties had accounts receivable, net of $515 and $1,353 and fees received in advance of $1,231 and $439 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P279_S4	In addition, the Company had revenues from related parties for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $49,788, $60,192 and $90,227, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P280_S0	The Company incurred expenses associated with the payment of insurance coverage premiums to certain of the related parties aggregating $41, $138 and $992 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P280_S1	These costs are included in Cost of revenues and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P281_S0	The Company s operations are conducted on leased premises.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P281_S1	Approximate minimum rentals under long-term noncancelable leases for all leased premises, computer equipment and automobiles are as follows:
1442145_11_ITEM8_P282_S0	Most of the leases require payment of property taxes and utilities and, in certain cases, contain renewal options.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P283_S0	Operating leases consist of office space.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P283_S1	Capital leases consist of computer equipment, office equipment, and leased automobiles.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P283_S2	Rent expense on operating leases approximated $23,898, $22,985 and $21,261 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P284_S0	In addition, the Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P284_S1	The Company is unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P284_S2	This is primarily because many of these cases remain in their early stages and only limited discovery has taken place.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P284_S3	Although the Company believes it has strong defenses for the litigation proceedings described below, the Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P285_S0	Hensley, et al. v. Computer Sciences Corporation et al. was a putative nationwide class action complaint, filed in February 2005, in Miller County, Arkansas state court.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P285_S1	Defendants include numerous insurance companies and providers of software products used by insurers in paying claims.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P285_S2	The Company is among the named defendants.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P285_S3	Plaintiffs allege that certain software products, including the Company s Claims Outcome Advisor product and a competing software product sold by Computer Sciences Corporation, improperly estimated the amount to be paid by insurers to their policyholders in connection with claims for bodily injuries.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P286_S0	The Company entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs asserting claims relating to the use of Claims Outcome Advisor by defendants Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive Car Insurance and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P286_S1	Each of these settlements was granted final approval by the court and together the settlements resolve the claims asserted in this case against the Company with respect to the above insurance companies, who settled the claims against them as well.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P286_S2	A provision was made in 2006 for this proceeding and the total amount the Company paid in 2008 with respect to these settlements was less than $2,000.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P286_S3	A fourth defendant, The Automobile Club of California, which is alleged to have used Claims Outcome Advisor, was dismissed from the action.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P287_S0	On August 18, 2008, pursuant to the agreement of the parties the Court ordered that the claims against the Company be dismissed with prejudice.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P288_S0	Subsequently, Hanover Insurance Group made a demand for reimbursement, pursuant to an indemnification provision contained in a December 30, 2004 License Agreement between Hanover and the Company, of its settlement and defense costs in the Hensley class action.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P288_S1	Specifically, Hanover demanded $2,536 including $600 in attorneys fees and expenses.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P288_S2	The Company disputes that Hanover is entitled to any reimbursement pursuant to the License Agreement.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P288_S3	In July 2010, after the Company and Hanover were unable to resolve the dispute in mediation, Hanover served a summons and complaint seeking indemnity and contribution from the Company.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P288_S4	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P289_S0	The following two lawsuits have been filed by or on behalf of groups of Louisiana insurance policyholders who claim, among other things, that certain insurers who used products and price information supplied by the Company s Xactware subsidiary (and those of another provider) did not fully compensate policyholders for property damage covered under their insurance policies.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P289_S1	The plaintiffs seek to recover compensation for their damages in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the defendants and the fair market repair/restoration costs of their damaged property.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S0	Schafer v. State Farm Fire Cas. Co. , et al. was a putative class action pending against the Company and State Farm Fire Casualty Company filed in March 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S1	The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S2	The court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against the Company other than fraud, which will proceed to the discovery phase along with the remaining claims against State Farm.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S3	Judge Duval denied plaintiffs motion to certify a class with respect to the fraud and breach of contract claims on August 3, 2009 and the time to appeal that decision has expired.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S4	The matter, now a single action, was reassigned to Judge Africk.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P290_S5	Plaintiffs agreed to settle the matter with the Company and State Farm and a Settlement Agreement and Release was executed by all parties in June 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S0	Mornay v. Travelers Ins. Co. , et al. is a putative class action pending against the Company and Travelers Insurance Company filed in November 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S1	The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S2	As in Schafer, the court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against the Company other than fraud.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S3	Judge Duval stayed all proceedings in the case pending an appraisal of the lead plaintiff s insurance claim.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S4	The matter has been re-assigned to Judge Barbier, who on September 11, 2009 issued an order administratively closing the matter pending completion of the appraisal process.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P291_S5	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P292_S0	In March 2007, the Company s subsidiary, Insurance Information Exchange, or iiX, as well as other information providers and insurers in the State of Texas, were served with a summons and class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging violations of the Driver Privacy Protection Act, or the DPPA, entitled Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Acxiom Corporation, et al .
1442145_11_ITEM8_P292_S1	Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals whose personal information is contained in any motor vehicle record maintained by the State of Texas and who have not provided express consent to the State of Texas for the distribution of their personal information for purposes not enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has been knowingly obtained and used by the defendants.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P292_S2	The class complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DPPA, punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained personal information.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P292_S3	The Court granted iiX s motion to dismiss the complaint based on failure to state a claim and for lack of standing.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P292_S4	Oral arguments on the plaintiffs appeal of that dismissal were held on November 4, 2009.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P293_S0	Court s dismissal of the complaint on July 14, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P293_S1	Plaintiffs filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on October 12, 2010, which was denied on January 10, 2011.

ACS State Local Solutions, et al.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P294_S1	Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals whose personal information is contained in any motor vehicle record maintained by the State of Missouri and who have not provided express consent to the State of Missouri for the distribution of their personal information for purposes not enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has been knowingly obtained and used by the defendants.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P294_S2	The class complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DDPA, punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained personal information.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P294_S3	The court granted iiX s motion to dismiss the complaint based on a failure to state a claim on November 19, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P295_S0	Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 17, 2010.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P296_S0	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to these matters.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P297_S0	In September 2009, the Company s subsidiary, Interthinx, Inc., was served with a putative class action entitled Renata Gluzman v. Interthinx, Inc.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P297_S1	The plaintiff, a former Interthinx employee, filed the class action on August 13, 2009 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all Interthinx information technology employees for unpaid overtime and missed meals and rest breaks, as well as various related claims claiming that the information technology employees were misclassified as exempt employees and, as a result, were denied certain wages and benefits that would have been received if they were properly classified as non-exempt employees.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P297_S2	The pleadings include, among other things, a violation of Business and Professions Code 17200 for unfair business practices, which allows plaintiffs to include as class members all information technology employees employed at Interthinx for four years prior to the date of filing the complaint.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P297_S3	The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties that are associated with the various statutes, restitution, interest costs, and attorney fees.
1442145_11_ITEM8_P297_S4	On June 2, 2010, Plaintiffs agreed to settle their claims with Interthinx.

1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Verisk Analytics is a leading provider of information about risk to professionals in insurance, healthcare, mortgage, government, supply chain, and risk management.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on industry expertise and unique proprietary data sets to provide predictive analytics and decision-support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, data management, and many other fields.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	In the United States and around the world, we help customers protect people, property, and financial assets.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P0_S6	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	In 2011, our U.S. customers included all of the top 100 P C insurance providers, as well as numerous health plans and third party administrators, leading mortgage insurers, and mortgage lenders.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	These four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers operations:
1442145_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims departments, independent adjustors and contractors.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	We add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented approximately 69.0% of our revenues in 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, we had revenues of $1,331.8 million and net income of $282.8 million.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P3_S4	For the five year period ended December 31, 2011, our revenues and net income grew at a CAGR of 13.5% and 17.1%, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our History We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P4_S5	Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	To further expand our Decision Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	acquiring several businesses that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2005, we entered the mortgage sector, acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection, compliance and decision support solutions for the U.S. mortgage industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2011, we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring Health Risk Partners, LLC, or HRP, which provides solutions to optimize revenue, which ensure compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid health plans, and Bloodhound Technologies, Inc., or Bloodhound, which provides real-time pre-adjudication medical claims editing.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S5	These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S6	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S7	Our senior management operating team, which includes our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, general counsel, and three senior officers who lead our business units, have been with us for an average of over twenty years.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P7_S8	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	Verisk Class A common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for information regarding our segments.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our Risk Analysis Framework: prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 30 years.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P11_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 2.9 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We maintain a database of over 15.8 billion statistical records, including approximately 6.1 billion commercial lines records and approximately 9.7 billion personal lines records.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We collect unit-transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our proprietary quality process includes almost 2,500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	We provide actuarial services to help our customers price their risks as they underwrite.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S5	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S6	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S7	We provide loss costs by coverage, class, territory, and many other categories.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S8	Our customers can use our estimates of future loss costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S9	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our loss costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S10	We make a number of actuarial adjustments, including loss development and loss adjustment expenses before the data is used to estimate future loss costs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S11	Our actuarial services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described below.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S12	Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P C insurance customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S13	We distribute a number of actuarial products and offer flexible services to meet our customers needs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S14	In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S15	We also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance, government agencies and real estate.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S16	We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P12_S17	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	To meet their needs, we process and interface with state regulators on average over 2,800 filings each year, ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S6	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S7	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P13_S8	We have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state s insurance rules and regulations, including on average over 13,000 legislative bills, 1,000 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	For example, in the homeowner s line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages, 254 national endorsements, and 479 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Overall, we provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 25 lines of insurance.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S5	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.3 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on more than 6 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S6	We have a staff of approximately 600 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S7	Each year, our field staff visits more than 350,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S8	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S9	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S10	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S11	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S12	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P14_S13	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of our Risk Analysis Framework.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	We develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and quantify losses.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Effective December 31, 2011, we provided additional disclosure about our revenue within Decision Analytics segment based on the industry vertical groupings of insurance, mortgage and financial services, healthcare and specialized markets.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Previously, we disclosed revenue based on the classification of our solution as fraud identification and detection solutions, loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	We believe that this change enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers) that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings.

1442145_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	We also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of automobiles and property, improving the chances of recovering those items; a service that helps owners and insurers recover stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment; an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Loss Prediction: We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in more than 80 countries.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy Loss Quantification:

1442145_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	To help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 467 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	We revise this information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 13,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys, and an analysis of the actual claims experience of our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	We estimate that about 80.0% of all homeowners claims settled in the U.S. annually use our solution.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	Utilization of such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S5	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S6	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P29_S7	We also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. since 1950.

1442145_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	Our fraud solutions can improve our customers profitability by predicting the likelihood that a customer account is experiencing fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	These applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and well-hidden to be identified by other methods.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification, which in turn requires us to identify, isolate and track mortgage applications through time.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Histories of multiple loans, both valid and fraudulent, are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	For this reason, unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data, their practicality is limited.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our proprietary database contains more than 21 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past ten years.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	This database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary third-party data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Our solution provides a score, which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	Working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau, we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	We believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S6	We also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S7	Our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S8	We then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P34_S9	Those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The recent turmoil in the mortgage industry has created an opportunity for growth in demand for our services, as we believe most mortgage insurers do not have the in-house capacity to respond to and properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	We offer solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect fraud, abuse and overpayment.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our approach combines computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	We run our customers claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse, physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	This combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians, physicians practices, hospitals, dentists, and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	After a suspicious source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations, including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	By finding the individual claims with the most cost-recovery potential and also minimizing the number of false-positive indications of fraud, we enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high levels of customer service to their insurers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	We also offer web-based reporting tools that let payors take definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of fraudulent claims.

1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal, state and local governments.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S8	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P55_S9	Lastly, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our costs of data received from our customers were 1.5% and 1.7% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,020 employees.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and Orem, Utah.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units, including AIR and Verisk Health in Boston and AISG Claimsearch in Israel.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition to these key data centers, we also have a number of smaller data centers located in other states.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S5	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S6	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P58_S7	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S5	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S6	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S7	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P61_S8	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we employed 5,200 full-time and 201 part-time employees.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our employees include over 200 actuarial professionals, including 43 Fellows and 25 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 147 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 19 Certified and 23 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and over 500 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S3	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S4	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S5	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S6	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P65_S7	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	To access these, click on the Financial Information SEC Filings link found on our Investor Relations homepage.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S7	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Specifically, a portion of Class A common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If the downturn in the U.S. insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 52.0 % of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Also, sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our revenues from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the U.S mortgage market.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Revenue derived from solutions we provide the U.S. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 10.0% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our forensic audits business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 67.0% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Mortgage origination volumes in 2011 declined versus 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P4_S7	This decline may continue based on changes in the mortgage market related to the U.S. mortgage crisis.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The restructuring or elimination of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could have a negative effect on the U. S. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the U.S. mortgage crisis.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Additionally, a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations, which could reduce the revenue in our origination-related business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2011 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers, our revenue may decline.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance services sector.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P8_S11	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P10_S9	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, customers misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P15_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities, lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S7	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	However, with the exception of Frank J. Coyne, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We are subject to antitrust and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust litigation.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our liquidity, financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in U.S. and international credit markets and economic conditions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, resulting in a contraction of available credit, even for the most credit-worthy borrowers.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Due to recent market events, our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In such an event, we may not be able to draw on all, or a substantial portion, of our uncommitted credit facilities, which would adversely affect our liquidity.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Also, if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or replacement of, our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	This decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the IPO and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own a portion of our Class A common stock, primarily owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP, representing in aggregate approximately 13.1 % of our outstanding common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 17,834,361 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of February 24, 2012 .
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2011, our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 22 states in the United States and the District of Columbia, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Canada, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, and Nepal.
1442145_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	With respect to the ongoing matter, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to this matter or the impact it may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	This is primarily because this case remains in its early stages and discovery has not yet commenced.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend this matter, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	Claims Outcome Advisor Litigation Hensley, et al.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	v. Computer Sciences Corporation et al. was a putative nationwide class action complaint, filed in February 2005, in Miller County, Arkansas state court.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	Defendants included numerous insurance companies and providers of software products used by insurers in paying claims.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	We were among the named defendants.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	Plaintiffs alleged that certain software products, including our Claims Outcome Advisor product and a competing software product sold by Computer Sciences Corporation, improperly estimated the amount to be paid by insurers to their policyholders in connection with claims for bodily injuries.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	We entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs asserting claims relating to the use of Claims Outcome Advisor by defendants Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive Car Insurance and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	Each of these settlements was granted final approval by the court and together the settlements resolve the claims asserted in this case against us with respect to the above insurance companies, who settled the claims against them as well.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	A provision was made in 2006 for this proceeding and the total amount we paid in 2008 with respect to these settlements was less than $2.0 million.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P3_S4	A fourth defendant, The Automobile Club of California, which is alleged to have used Claims Outcome Advisor, was dismissed from the action.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	On August 18, 2008, pursuant to the agreement of the parties the Court ordered that the claims against us be dismissed with prejudice.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	Subsequently, Hanover Insurance Group made a demand for reimbursement, pursuant to an indemnification provision contained in a December 30, 2004 License Agreement between Hanover and us, of its settlement and defense costs in the Hensley class action.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	Specifically, Hanover demanded $2.5 million including $0.6 million in attorneys fees and expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S3	We disputed that Hanover is entitled to any reimbursement pursuant to the License Agreement.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S4	In July 2010, after Hanover and us were unable to resolve the dispute in mediation, Hanover served a summons and complaint seeking indemnity and contribution from us.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P4_S5	The parties resolved this matter with no material adverse consequences to us in a Settlement Agreement and Release executed on August 25, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs seek to recover compensation for their damages in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the defendants and the fair market repair/restoration costs of their damaged property.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	Schafer v. State Farm Fire Cas. Co., et al. was a putative class action pending against us and State Farm Fire Casualty Company filed in March 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	The court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against us other than fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S3	Judge Duval denied plaintiffs motion to certify a class with respect to the fraud and breach of contract claims on August 3, 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S4	After the single action was re-assigned to Judge Africk, plaintiffs agreed to settle the matter with us and State Farm and a Settlement Agreement and Release was executed by all parties in June 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P6_S5	The terms of the settlement were not considered material to us.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	Mornay v. Travelers Ins. Co., et al. was a putative class action pending against us and Travelers Insurance Company filed in November 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	As in Schafer, the court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims against us other than fraud.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P7_S3	Judge Duval stayed all proceedings in the case pending an appraisal of the lead plaintiff s insurance claim.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P7_S4	The matter was re-assigned to Judge Barbier, who on September 11, 2009 issued an order administratively closing the matter pending completion of the appraisal process.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P8_S0	After the appraisal process was completed and the court lifted the stay, defendants filed a motion to strike the class allegations and dismiss the fraud claim.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P8_S1	The plaintiffs agreed to settle the matter and a Settlement Agreement and Release were executed by all parties on January 5, 2012.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P9_S0	The terms of the settlement were not considered material to us.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P10_S0	In April 2010, our subsidiary, Insurance Information Exchange or iiX, as well as other information providers in the State of Missouri were served with a summons and class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri alleging violations of the Driver Privacy Protection Act, or the DPPA, entitled Janice Cook, et al. v. ACS State Local Solutions, et al.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P10_S1	Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals whose personal information is contained in any motor vehicle record maintained by the State of Missouri and who have not provided express consent to the State of Missouri for the distribution of their personal information for purposes not enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has been knowingly obtained and used by the defendants.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P10_S2	The class complaint alleged that the defendants knowingly obtained personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA and sought liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DPPA, punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained personal information.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P10_S3	The court granted iiX s motion to dismiss the complaint based on a failure to state a claim on November 19, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P11_S0	Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 17, 2010 and oral argument was heard by the Eighth Circuit on September 18, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P11_S1	The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court s dismissal on December 15, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P12_S0	In September 2009, our subsidiary, Interthinx, Inc., was served with a putative class action entitled Renata Gluzman v. Interthinx, Inc .
1442145_12_ITEM3_P12_S1	The plaintiff, a former Interthinx employee, filed the class action on August 13, 2009 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all Interthinx information technology employees for unpaid overtime and missed meals and rest breaks, as well as various related claims claiming that the information technology employees were misclassified as exempt employees and, as a result, were denied certain wages and benefits that would have been received if they were properly classified as non-exempt employees.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P13_S0	The complaint sought compensatory damages, penalties that are associated with the various statutes, restitution, interest costs, and attorney fees.

1442145_12_ITEM3_P13_S2	The terms of the settlement were not considered material to us.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P14_S0	We have received notice of a complaint filed on February 7, 2012 in the Florida State Circuit Court for Pasco County naming Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ( Citizens ) and the Company s Xactware subsidiary.

1442145_12_ITEM3_P14_S2	It alleges a class action seeking declaratory relief against defendants and is brought on behalf of all individuals who have purchased a new or renewed a property casualty insurance policy from Citizens where Citizens used an Xactware product to determine replacement value of the property.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P14_S3	The complaint has not yet been served on Xactware.
1442145_12_ITEM3_P14_S4	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter.

1442145_12_ITEM5_P0_S4	We believe the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders for Class A, because a large portion of Class A common stock is held in street name by brokers.
1442145_12_ITEM5_P0_S5	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.

1442145_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected historical financial data should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, Item 7.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2011 we acquired 13 businesses, which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance: The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31:
1442145_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	year 2011 and reversed the contingent consideration related to these acquisitions.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, we reevaluated the probability of TierMed achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed its contingent consideration related to this acquisition.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	(3) In conjunction with the IPO, the stock of Insurance Services Office, Inc. converted to stock of Verisk Analytics, Inc, which effected a fifty-to-one stock split of its common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P5_S1	The numbers in the above table reflect this stock split.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	(4) EBITDA is the financial measure, which management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P6_S1	EBITDA is defined as net income before investment income and realized (gain)/loss on securities, net, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P6_S2	Beginning in 2011 our EBITDA includes acquisition related liability adjustments for all periods presented.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P6_S3	In addition, this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P6_S4	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P7_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P7_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P8_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P9_S0	(6) Prior to our corporate reorganization, we were required to record our Class A common stock and vested options at redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within our control, due to our contractual obligations to redeem these shares.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P9_S1	We classified this redemption value as redeemable common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P9_S2	After our IPO, we were no longer obligated to redeem these shares and therefore we reversed the redeemable common stock balance.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P9_S3	See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P10_S0	(7) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders deficit, as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_12_ITEM6_P10_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we repurchased $380.7 million and $422.3 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P C insurance, mortgage and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our IPO, Insurance Service Office, Inc., or ISO, formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	On October 6, 2009 in connection with our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by Class B insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning Class B common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 42.3 % and 47.6% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our Decision Analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework: Prediction of Loss, Detection and Prevention of Fraud, and Quantification of Loss.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Effective December 31, 2011, we realigned the revenue categories within Decision Analytics segment, including fraud identification and detection solutions, loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions, into four vertical market-related groupings of insurance, mortgage and financial services, healthcare, and specialized markets.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 57.7% and 52.4% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 4.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan, obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, 31.1% and 30.2% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S8	Approximately 85.7% and 84.0% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S9	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S10	Approximately 56.6% and 56.8% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S11	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S12	Personnel expenses include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs (described under Equity Compensation Costs below), sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs, which represented 65.3% and 65.4% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P10_S13	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S7	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S8	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S9	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P11_S10	Description of Acquisitions We acquired eight businesses since January 1, 2009.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	On December 14, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Crowe Paradis Services Corporation, or CP, a leading provider of claims analysis and compliance solutions to the property/casualty insurance industry.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Within our Decision Analytics segment, CP offers solutions for complying with the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Act, provides services to many of the largest worker s compensation insurers, third-party administrators (TPAs), and self-insured companies which enhances solutions we currently offer.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, SA s solutions and application set will allow our customers to take advantage of state-of-the-art loss forecasting, stress testing, and economic capital requirement tools to better understand and forecast the risk associated within their credit portfolios.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	On October 30, 2009, we acquired the net assets of Enabl-u Technology Corporation, Inc, or Enabl-u, a privately owned provider of data management, training and communication solutions to companies with regional, national or global work forces.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Equity Compensation Costs We have a leveraged ESOP, funded with intercompany debt that includes 401(k), ESOP and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	As the debt is repaid, shares are released to the ESOP to fund 401(k) matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants eligible compensation.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the ESOP.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Depending on the number of shares released to the plan during the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares, a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense will occur.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
1442145_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In connection with our IPO, on October 6, 2009, we accelerated our future ESOP allocation contribution through the end of the ESOP in 2013, to all participants eligible for a contribution in 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	This resulted in a non-recurring, non-cash charge of approximately $57.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a result, subsequent to the offering, the non-cash ESOP allocation expense was substantially reduced.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Excluding the ESOP allocation, expense relating specifically to our 401(k) and profit sharing plans were $12.6 million, $11.6 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	In addition, the portion of the ESOP allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the ESOP above the value of those shares when the ESOP was first established is not tax deductible.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Prior to our IPO, our Class A stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date, as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the Company (see Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements).
1442145_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on October 6, 2009, we are no longer obligated to redeem Class A stock and therefore are not required to present our Class A stock and vested stock options at redemption value.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	The reversal of the redeemable common stock of $1,064.9 million on October 6, 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of $440.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million to Class A common stock at par value, an increase of $624.3 million to additional paid-in-capital, and a reclassification of the ISO Class A unearned common stock KSOP shares balance of $1.3 million to unearned KSOP contribution.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	In 2011 and in 2010, we acquired five companies, HRP, Bloodhound, CP, 3E, and SA, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Recent acquisitions were within our Decision Analytics segment and provided an increase of $106.9 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $86.6 million, which included an increase in our Risk Assessment segment of $21.2 million and an increase in our Decision Analytics segment of $65.4 million.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $16.6 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	Other increases include leased software expenses of $3.4 million, travel and travel related costs of $1.3 million, office maintenance expense of $0.4 million and other operating costs of $4.1 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S9	These increases in costs were partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in data costs primarily within in our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S10	The increase in salaries and employee benefits of $16.6 million includes an increase of $19.4 million in annual salaries and employee benefits such as medical costs and equity incentive plan, and was partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 million in pension costs.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P25_S11	The pension cost decreased primarily due to the partial recovery in 2010 of the fair value of our pension investments.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA, were $209.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $43.1 million or 25.9%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Excluding costs associated with our recent acquisitions of $31.6 million, SGA increased $11.5 million or 7.0%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $8.8 million which includes annual salary increases, medical costs, commissions, and equity compensation.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	Other increases were cost related to travel and travel related items of $1.1 million, rent and maintenance of $0.4 million and other general expenses of $1.2 million.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	The increase was primarily related to amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions of $13.4 million, partially offset by $6.0 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions that have been fully amortized.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Acquisition Related Liabilities Adjustment Acquisition related liabilities adjustment was a benefit of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	This benefit was a result of a reduction of $3.4 million to contingent consideration due to the reduced probability of the D2 and SA acquisitions achieving the EBITDA and revenue earnout targets for exceptional performance in fiscal year 2011 established at the time of acquisition.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	In 2010, we reevaluated the probability of TierMed achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed $0.5 million of contingent consideration related to this acquisition.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Investment Income and Realized Gain/(Loss) on Securities, Net Investment income and realized gain/(loss) on securities, net, was a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.5 million.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	This increase is primarily due to the issuance of our 5.800% and 4.875% senior notes in the aggregate principal of $450.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $177.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $164.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $13.6 million or 8.3%.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was lower due to settlements and resolution of uncertain tax positions, as well as a decrease in deferred taxes and a corresponding increase in tax expense in 2010 of $2.4 million resulting from reduced tax benefits of Medicare subsidies associated with legislative changes in 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 44.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the recent acquisitions mitigated our margin expansion by 1.7% and was partially offset by the acquisition related liabilities adjustment which positively impacted our EBITDA margin by 0.3%.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Excluding the recent acquisitions, our insurance revenue increased $54.4 million primarily due to an increase within our loss quantification solutions as a result of new customers and of higher volumes related to various natural disasters, particularly the increased storm activity within the U.S.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	In addition, there was an increase in our catastrophe modeling services for existing and new customers, as well an increase in insurance fraud solutions revenue.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	Excluding the recent acquisitions, our healthcare revenue increased $11.5 million primarily due to an increase in our fraud services as customer contracts were implemented and new sales of risk solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	Our specialized markets revenue, excluding recent acquisitions, increased $3.2 million as a result of continued penetration of existing customers within our weather and climate risk solutions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our mortgage and financial services of $3.7 million, excluding recent acquisitions, primarily due to lower volumes within our underwriting and forensic solutions due to the continued challenges within the mortgage market.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the recent acquisitions mitigated our margin expansion by 2.4% and a reallocation of information technology and corporate resources also mitigated our margin.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	These mitigating factors were partially offset by the acquisition related liabilities adjustment, which positively impacted our EBITDA margin by 0.4%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Risk Assessment Revenues Revenues were $563.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $542.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $21.2 million or 3.9%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The overall increase within this segment primarily resulted from an increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the content of our industry-standard insurance programs solutions as well as selling expanded solutions to existing customers.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our revenue by category for the periods presented is set forth below:
1442145_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues for our Risk Assessment segment was $193.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1.0 million or 0.5%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The decrease was primarily due to decrease in salaries and employee benefits costs of $2.0 million, primarily related to lower pension cost of $2.4 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Salaries and employee benefit costs, excluding pension costs, increased only moderately due to a reallocation of information technology resources to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Other decreases were related to office maintenance expense of $0.8 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in travel and travel related costs of $0.5 million, data and consultant costs of $0.2 million, leased software $0.1 million and other general expenses of $1.0 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Risk Assessment segment were $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $4.5 million or 5.7%.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies achieved in 2011 and a reallocation of information technology and corporate resources to our Decision Analytics segment during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Revenues were $1,138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1,027.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $111.2 million or 10.8%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	In 2010 and the latter half of 2009, we acquired five companies, TierMed, Enabl-u, Strategic Analytics, CP, and 3E, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Recent acquisitions provided an increase of $10.5 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $100.7 million, which included an increase in our Risk Assessment segment of $18.1 million and an increase in our Decision Analytics segment of $82.6 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for further information regarding our revenues.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues was $463.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $491.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $27.8 million or 5.7%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	This decrease was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred in 2009, which resulted in the elimination of substantially all future ESOP allocation expense.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S6	In 2010 and 2009, our ESOP allocation expense for the year was $0.0 million and $51.9 million, respectively.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S7	The reduction in our cost of revenues was offset by recent acquisitions, which provided an increase of $6.4 million in cost for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S8	Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 and the cost associated with our recent acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $17.7 million or 4.0%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S9	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $16.9 million; $4.1 million of data and consultants costs incurred in connection with the growth in our property-specific rating and underwriting information, and fraud identification and detection solutions; and other general expenses of $0.3 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S10	These increases in costs were partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in state employment tax credit and a reduction in office maintenance expense of $0.9 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S11	The increase in salaries and employee benefits of $16.9 million includes an increase of $24.6 million in annual salaries and employee benefits such as medical costs and long-term incentive plan, and was partially offset by a decrease of $7.7 million in pension costs.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S12	The increase in salaries and benefit costs is related to a modest increase in employee headcount, primarily in Decision Analytics.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P37_S13	The pension cost decreased $7.7 million primarily due to the partial recovery in 2009 of the fair value of our pension investments.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA, were $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $162.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $3.8 million or 2.3%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 of $15.4 million and costs associated with our recent acquisitions of $4.8 million, SGA increased $14.4 million or 9.8%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $14.4 million, which includes annual salary increases, medical costs, commissions, and long-term incentive plan.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	Other increases were costs related to advertising and marketing of $2.5 million and other general expenses of $2.1 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal costs primarily related to our IPO in 2009 of $2.8 million and a reduction in pension cost of $1.8 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P38_S5	Depreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.1 million or 5.6%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets includes depreciation of furniture and equipment, software, computer hardware, and related equipment.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The majority of the increase relates to software and hardware costs to support data capacity expansion and revenue growth.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets was $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5.2 million or 16.0%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	This decrease was primarily related to a decrease of $6.3 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions that have been fully amortized; partially offset by $1.1 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Acquisition Related Liabilities Adjustment Acquisition related liabilities adjustment was a benefit of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010; there was no such adjustment in 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	This benefit was as a result of a reduction of $0.5 million to contingent consideration due to the reduced probability of TierMed, a recent acquisition, achieving the EBITDA and revenue earnout targets set at the time of the acquisition.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Investment Income and Realized Gains/(Losses) on Securities, Net Investment income and realized gains/(losses) on securities, net, was a gain of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.5 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Interest Expense Interest expense was $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $0.6 million or 1.7%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	This decrease was primarily due to reduced interest costs as a result of a decrease in average debt outstanding of approximately $605 million in 2010 compared to approximately $650 million in 2009, coupled with a decrease in our interest rate on borrowings from our syndicated revolving credit facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	The decrease in borrowing rate was the result of an amendment to the facility on September 10, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the syndicated credit facility, which had been entered into in July of 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $164.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $138.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $26.1 million or 18.9%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	rate was 40.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses in 2010 versus 2009 related to the KSOP.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Our EBITDA margin does not reflect any ESOP allocation expense in 2010 due to the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred in 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The ESOP allocation expense of $67.3 million in 2009 negatively impacted our 2009 EBITDA margin by approximately 6.6%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	Also included in the calculation of our 2009 EBITDA margin are costs of $7.0 million associated with the preparation of our IPO for the year ended December 31, 2009, which also negatively impacted our margin by 0.7%.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	For our 2010 EBITDA margin, a decrease in pension costs of $9.5 million positively impacted our margin by approximately 0.8%.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.

1442145_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $4.7 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S9	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S10	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S11	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S12	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P73_S13	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P74_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock based compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	of qualitative and quantitative factors including the nature of the business and history of the enterprise, the economic outlook in general, the condition of the specific industries in which we operate, the financial condition of the business, our ability to generate free cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible asset value.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies, including the use of the guideline company method.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	This determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis, which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable, in whole or in part, to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	These methodologies have been consistently applied since 1997.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	We regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies, including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis, the future forecasts of revenue and earnings, and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	These assumptions are reviewed quarterly, with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P78_S4	For the comparable company analysis, the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	As the number of shares outstanding has declined over time, our share price has increased.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	The determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	If different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_12_ITEM7_P80_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $936.4 million, which represents 60.8% of our total assets.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	During fiscal year 2011, we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2011 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $709.9 million as of December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Pension and Postretirement We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2011, we determined this rate to be 4.98%, a decrease of 0.51% from the 5.49% rate used at December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P86_S8	Our postretirement rate is 3.50% at December 31, 2011, a decrease of 0.50% from the 4.00% used at December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.0% debt securities and 60.0% equity securities.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the plan assets were allocated 47.0% debt, 51.0% equity securities, and 2.0% to other investments.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S5	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P88_S6	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the Postretirement Plan.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of $2.4 million as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	On January 12, 2012, we announced a hard freeze, which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits, to be instituted on February 29, 2012 to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	The freeze in 2012 will reduce the unfunded pension liability by approximately $10.2 million and we will realize a curtailment gain of approximately $0.7 million.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	A one percent change in discount rate, future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects: Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	On January 1, 2007, we adopted Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	As a result of the implementation of this interpretation, we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.3 million, which was accounted for as an increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings/(accumulated deficit).
1442145_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $87.1 million, which will expire at various dates from 2012 through 2031.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $6.3 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2012, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(s) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility, which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.250% to 1.875% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility.
1442145_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2011, a one percent change in interest rates would not result in a change in annual pretax interest expense based on our current level of borrowings.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Verisk Analytics, Inc. Jersey City, New Jersey We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_12_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P4_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Verisk Analytics, Inc. Jersey City, New Jersey We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Prior to January 1, 2008, the expected term (estimated period of time outstanding) was estimated using the simplified method as defined in ASC 718, in which the expected term equals the average of vesting term and the contractual term.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	Subsequent to January 1, 2008, the expected term was primarily estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behaviors.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise patterns existed, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity awards.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	Expected volatility for awards prior to January 1, 2008 was based on the Company s historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected term, ending on the day of grant, and calculated on a quarterly basis for purposes of the ISO 401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( KSOP ).
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	For awards granted after January 1, 2008, the volatility factor was based on an average of the historical stock prices of a group of the Company s peers over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the stock option award.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	Prior to 2008, the expected dividend yield was not included in the fair value calculation as the Company did not pay dividends.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S4	For awards granted after January 1, 2008, the expected dividends yield was based on the Company s expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S5	The Company estimates expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S6	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P50_S7	Changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the requisite service period, and may impact the timing of expense recognized over the requisite service period.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent these assets are more likely than not to be realized.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740-10 and in subsequent periods.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P56_S3	This standard also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P56_S4	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	Such indemnifications are primarily granted under licensing of computer software.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	Most agreements contain provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications; however, the Company is not able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	(r) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S2	Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S4	The Company completed the required annual impairment test as of June 30, 2011, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill in 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S5	This test compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S6	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S7	If the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company will determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P64_S8	If the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of the goodwill.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	ASU No. 2011-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P65_S3	The adoption of ASU No. 2011-12 will not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company continues to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU No. 2011-08 ).
1442145_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Under ASU No. 2011-08, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company has elected not to early adopt and will continue to assess the recoverability of goodwill under its existing practice.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	ASU No. 2011-08 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has incorporated and will continue to incorporate consideration of qualitative factors in the goodwill impairment testing.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	ASU No. 2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as this guidance does not result in a change in the items that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ( ASU No. 2011-04 ).

1442145_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	ASU No. 2011-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as this guidance does not result in a change in the application of the requirements in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements .

1442145_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	ASC 480-10-S99-1 required the Company to record ISO Class A common stock and vested stock options at full redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the Company.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P152_S2	Subsequent changes to the redemption value of the securities were charged first to retained earnings; once retained earnings was depleted, then to additional paid-in-capital, and if additional paid-in-capital was also depleted, then to accumulated deficit.

1442145_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	The reversal of the redeemable common stock balance was first applied against accumulated deficit; once the accumulated deficit was depleted, then to additional paid-in-capital up to the amount equal to the additional paid-in-capital of the Company as if ASC 480-10-S99-1 was never required to be adopted.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P156_S1	Any remaining balance was credited to retained earnings.
1442145_12_ITEM8_P156_S2	The reversal of the redeemable common stock of $1,064,896 on October 6, 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of $440,584, an increase of $30 to Class A common stock at par value, an increase of $624,282 to additional paid-in-capital, and a reclassification of the ISO Class A unearned common stock KSOP shares balance of $1,305 to unearned KSOP contributions.

1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Verisk Analytics is a leading provider of information about risk to professionals in insurance, healthcare, financial, government, supply chain, and risk management.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on industry expertise and unique proprietary data sets to provide predictive analytics and decision-support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, data management, and many other fields.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	In the United States and around the world, we help customers protect people, property, and financial assets.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S6	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S7	In 2012, for the lines of P C services we offer, our U.S. customers included all of the top 100 P C insurance providers, 17 of the top 20 U.S credit card issuers, as well as numerous health plans and third party administrators.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P0_S8	We believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	These four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers operations:
1442145_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims departments, independent adjustors and contractors.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	We add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented approximately 67.2% of our revenues in 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012, we had revenues of $1,534.3 million and net income of $329.1 million.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	For the five year period ended December 31, 2012, our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 14.5% and 20.1%, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our History We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P3_S5	Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	In 2004, we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	In 2005, we entered the mortgage sector, acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection, compliance and decision support solutions for the U.S. mortgage industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S5	In 2011 and 2012, we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring Health Risk Partners, LLC, or HRP, which provides solutions to optimize revenue, improve compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage health plans and MediConnect Global, Inc. or MediConnect, which provides medical record retrieval, digitization, coding, extraction, and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S6	Also in 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, to expand our presence in providing information, competitive benchmarking, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S7	These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S8	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S9	Our senior management operating team, which includes our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, general counsel, and four senior officers who lead our business and operational units, have been with us for an average of over 15 years.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P5_S10	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	Verisk Class A common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for information regarding our segments.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our Risk Analysis Framework: prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	filings each year, ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S4	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S5	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S6	We have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state s insurance rules and regulations, including on average over 9,200 legislative bills, 1,000 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S7	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S8	For example, in the homeowner s line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages, 255 national endorsements, and 514 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P10_S9	Overall, we provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed or appointed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S8	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 2.9 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S9	We maintain a database of over 16.5 billion statistical records, including approximately 6.5 billion commercial lines records and approximately 10.0 billion personal lines records.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S10	We collect unit-transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S11	Our proprietary quality process includes almost 2,500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S12	We provide actuarial services to help our customers analyze and price their risks.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S13	Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P C insurance customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S14	We distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our customers needs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S15	In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P11_S16	We also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.4 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on more than 6.1 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S5	We have a staff of more than 550 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S6	Each year, our field staff visits more than over 300,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S7	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S8	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S9	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S10	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S11	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P14_S12	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of our Risk Analysis Framework.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and quantify losses.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers) that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our database contains information on approximately 844 million claims and is the world s largest database of P C claims information used for claims and investigations.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claim records, more than 254,000 a day on average, across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	We also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of automobiles and property, improving the chances of recovering those items; a service that helps owners and insurers recover stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment; an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in more than 90 countries.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy We provide data, analytic and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	We provide solutions for every phase of a building s life, including:
1442145_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters, contractors and policyholders To help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 467 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We revise this information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 13,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys, and an analysis of the actual claims experience of our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	We estimate that about 80.0% of all homeowners claims settled in the U.S. annually use our solution.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	Utilization of such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S5	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S6	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S7	We also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. since 1950.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S8	We focus on providing competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to financial services institutions in North and South America and Europe.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S9	We maintain the most comprehensive de-personalized direct observation consortia data sets for the payments industry.

1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S11	We have deployed unique technology to manage vast data sets efficiently and manage vast amount of payments data.

1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S18	Furthermore, we are a leading provider of automated fraud detection, compliance and decision-support tools for the mortgage industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S19	Utilizing our own loan level application database combined with actual mortgage loan performance data, we have established a risk scoring system which increases our customers ability to detect fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S20	We provide solutions that detect fraud through each step of the mortgage lifecycle and provide regulatory compliance solutions that perform instant compliance reviews of each mortgage application.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S21	Our fraud solutions can improve our customers profitability by predicting the likelihood that a customer account is experiencing fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S22	Our solution analyzes customer transactions in real time and generates recommendations for immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P27_S23	These applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and well-hidden to be identified by other methods.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification, which in turn requires us to identify, isolate and track mortgage applications through time.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Histories of multiple loans, both valid and fraudulent, are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	For this reason, unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data, their practicality is limited.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our proprietary database contains more than 23 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past ten years.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	This database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary third-party data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our solution provides a score, which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau, we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	We believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	We also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S5	Our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S6	We then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P31_S7	Those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Healthcare We offer payment accuracy solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect fraud, abuse and overpayment.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our approach combines computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	We run our customers claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse, physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	This combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians, physicians practices, hospitals, dentists, and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	After a suspicious source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations, including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	By finding the individual claims with the most cost-recovery potential and also minimizing the number of false-positive indications of fraud, we enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high levels of customer service to their insurers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	We also offer web-based reporting tools that let payors take definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of fraudulent claims.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	The tools provide the documentation that helps to identify, investigate and prevent abusive and fraudulent activity by providers.

1442145_13_ITEM1_P44_S7	Since 2008, we have acquired 14 businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P44_S8	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P44_S9	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and sales support.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had a sales force of 295 people.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical product sets to targeted markets.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers, we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	Tier One or National Accounts constitutes our largest customers, Tier Two or Strategic Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market carriers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	Tier Three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business and/or be one-state or regional writers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	A Sales Generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Sales people participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	Both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	These agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal, state and local governments.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S8	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S9	Sixth, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P51_S10	Lastly, we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our costs of data received from our customers were 1.3% and 1.5% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,200 employees.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S5	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P52_S6	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Data Centers We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and Orem, Utah.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units, located in other states.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S6	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S7	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S8	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S9	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P56_S10	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2012, we employed 6,078 full-time and 417 part-time employees.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	Our employees include over 200 actuarial professionals, including 50 Fellows and 26 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 145 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 16 Certified and 24 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and over 531 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S5	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S6	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P58_S7	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.

1442145_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	The public may read and copy any materials filed by Verisk with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1442145_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S7	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Specifically, a portion of Class A common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 48.3% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach A downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our revenues from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the U.S mortgage market.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Revenue derived from solutions we provide the U.S. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 8.5% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our forensic audits business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 52.0% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The restructuring or elimination of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could have a negative effect on the U. S. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the U.S. mortgage crisis.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Additionally, a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations, which could reduce the revenue in our origination-related business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2012 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers, our revenue may continue to decline.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S8	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance and healthcare services sector.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P8_S11	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P10_S9	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, customers or other s misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P16_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, much of our capacity is under our uncommitted facilities, under which lenders are not required to loan us any funds.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may not experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our acquisition of Argus increased our leverage; in addition, we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S8	On August 31, 2012 we completed our acquisition of Argus.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S9	In order to finance the acquisition we incurred $380.0 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S10	On August 31, 2012, our total debt increased to approximately $1,600.0 million and our leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA (last twelve months proforma)) increased from 1.90x to 2.34x, and as of December 31, 2012 our total debt was approximately $1,461.4 million and our leverage ratio was 2.11x.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S11	Our increased leverage resulting from the Argus acquisition could adversely affect our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S12	In particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P19_S13	In addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	However, with the exception of Frank J. Coyne, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S10	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S11	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S13	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S14	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S15	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S16	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S17	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P20_S18	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and related obligations.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S8	This decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As of December 31, 2012, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the IPO and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own a portion of our Class A common stock, primarily owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP, representing in aggregate approximately 14.6% of our outstanding common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 12,276,269 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of February 21, 2013.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2012, our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 22 states in the United States and the District of Columbia, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Canada, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Nepal, and Singapore.
1442145_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because these cases remain in its early stages and discovery has not yet commenced.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Citizens Insurance Litigation On February 28, 2012, we were served with a complaint filed in the Florida State Circuit Court for Pasco County naming Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ( Citizens ) and the Company s Xactware subsidiary.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleged a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants and was brought on behalf of all individuals who have purchased a new or renewed a property casualty insurance policy from Citizens where Citizens used Xactware s 360Value product to determine replacement value of the property.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	On March 12, 2012, plaintiffs served their First Amended Complaint additionally alleging : (1) that Citizens and Xactware knowingly made false statements to the plaintiff class concerning their properties replacement cost values; (2) fraud against Xactware based on its alleged misrepresentation of the replacement value of plaintiffs properties; (3) conspiracy against Citizens and Xactware based on their alleged artificial inflation of the value of plaintiffs properties; and (4) products liability against Xactware, claiming Xactware defectively designed 360Value as used in the Florida insurance market.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	The First Amended Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified monetary damages alleged to be in excess of $1,000 for the class.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	On May 31, 2012 plaintiff served his Second Amended Complaint which no longer alleged a class action, but continued to allege: (1) that Citizens and Xactware artificially inflated the replacement cost value of plaintiff s property using 360Value; (2) fraud by Xactware; (3) a conspiracy between Citizens and Xactware; and (4) products liability against Xactware.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	The Second Amended Complaint similarly sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages representing the difference between the premium plaintiff paid to Citizens using 360Value and what the premium should have been if Citizens used an accurate replacement cost value for plaintiff s property.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	Defendants motion to transfer was granted and the case was transferred to the Leon County Circuit Court on September 17, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P1_S7	Plaintiff dismissed all claims against Xactware on November 26, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	Litigation On April 20, 2012, we were served with a class action complaint filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California naming the Company s subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. ( Intellicorp ) titled Jane Roe v. Intellicorp Records, Inc.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	The complaint alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and claimed that Intellicorp failed to implement reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the adverse information contained in the background reports, failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that criminal record information provided to employers is complete and up to date, and failed to notify class members contemporaneously of the fact that criminal record information was being provided to their employers and prospective employers.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	The District Court later granted Intellicorp s motion to transfer the case, which is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	On October 24, 2012 plaintiffs served their First Amended Complaint (the Roe Complaint ) alleging a nationwide putative class action on behalf of all persons who were the subject of a Criminal SuperSearch or other instant consumer background report furnished to a third party by Intellicorp for employment purposes, and whose report contained any negative public record of criminal arrest, charge, or conviction without also disclosing the final disposition of the charges during the 5 years preceding the filing of this action through the date class certification is granted.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Roe Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P4_S2	On February 4, 2013, the District Court granted plaintiffs motion to amend the Roe Complaint to eliminate the named plaintiff s individual claim for compensatory damages.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P4_S3	This amendment did not change the breadth or scope of the request for relief sought on behalf of the proposed class.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P5_S0	On November 1, 2012, we were served with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio naming the Company s subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. titled Michael R. Thomas v. Intellicorp Records, Inc.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P5_S1	On January 7, 2013 plaintiff served its First Amended Complaint (the Thomas Complaint ) to add Mark A. Johnson (the plaintiff in the Johnson v. iiX matter described below) as a named plaintiff.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P5_S2	The Thomas Complaint alleges a nationwide putative class action for violations of FCRA on behalf of [a]ll natural persons residing in the United States (a) who were the subject of a report sold by Intellicorp to a third party, (b) that was furnished for an employment purpose, (c) that contained at least one public record of a criminal conviction or arrest, civil lien, bankruptcy or civil judgment, (d) within five years next preceding the filing of this action and during its pendency, and (e) to whom Intellicorp did not place in the United States mail postage-prepaid, on the day it furnished any part of the report, a written notice that it was furnishing the subject report and containing the name of the person that was to receive the report.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P5_S3	The Thomas Complaint proposes an alternative subclass as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM3_P5_S4	[a]ll natural persons residing in Ohio or Tennessee (a) who were the subject of a report sold by Intellicorp to a third party, (b) that was furnished for an employment purpose, (c) that contained at least one public record of a criminal conviction or arrest, civil lien, bankruptcy or civil judgment, (d) within five years next preceding the filing of this action and during its pendency, (e) when a mutual review of the record would reveal that the identity associated with the public record does not match the identity of the class member about whom the report was furnished, and (f) to whom Intellicorp did not place in the United States mail postage pre-paid, on the day it furnished any part of the report, a written notice that it was furnishing the subject report and containing the name of the person that was to receive the report.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P6_S0	Similar to the Roe action, the Thomas Complaint alleges that Intellicorp violated the FCRA, asserting that Intellicorp violated section 1681k(a)(1) of the FCRA because it failed to provide notice to the plaintiffs at the time the adverse public record information was reported.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P6_S1	The named plaintiffs also allege individual claims under section 1681e(b) claiming that Intellicorp failed to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in the preparation of the consumer report it furnished pertaining to plaintiffs.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P7_S0	The Thomas Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees, as well as compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the named plaintiffs.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P8_S0	iiX Litigation On January 3, 2013 we received service of a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio naming the Company s subsidiary Insurance Information Exchange ( iiX ) titled Mark A. Johnson v. Insurance Information Exchange, LLC (the Johnson Complaint ) .
1442145_13_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Johnson Complaint alleges a nationwide putative class action on behalf of all natural persons residing in the United States who were the subject of a consumer report prepared by iiX for employment purposes within five (5) years prior to the filing of this Complaint and to whom iiX did not provide notice of the fact that public record information which is likely to have an adverse effect upon the consumer s ability to obtain employment, is being reported by iiX, together with the name and address of the person to whom such information is being reported at the time such public record information is reported to the user of such consumer report.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P9_S0	Johnson Complaint alleges violations of section 1681k(a) of the FCRA claiming that iiX failed to notify customers contemporaneously that criminal record information was provided to a prospective employer and failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that the information reported is complete and up to date.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P9_S1	The Johnson Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_13_ITEM3_P9_S2	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to these matters.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information Verisk trades under the ticker symbol VRSK on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Our common stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of February 21, 2013, the closing price of our Class A common stock was $53.73 per share, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	As of February 21, 2013, there were approximately 28 Class A stockholders of record.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	We believe the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders for Class A, because a large portion of Class A common stock is held in street name by brokers.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S5	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S6	We have not paid or declared any cash dividends on our Class A common stock during the two most recent fiscal years and we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S7	We do have a publicly announced share repurchase plan and have repurchased 29,887,667 shares since our IPO.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P0_S8	As of December 31, 2012, we had 376,275,965 shares of treasury stock.

1442145_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities There were no unregistered sales of equity securities by the Company during the period covered by this report.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Our board of directors have authorized a share repurchase program, or Repurchase Program, up to $900.0 million, of which $144.2 million remains available as of December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	Under the Repurchase Program, we may repurchase stock in the market or as otherwise determined by us.
1442145_13_ITEM5_P3_S2	These authorizations have no expiration dates and may be suspended or terminated at any time.

1442145_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected historical financial data should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, Item 7.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 we acquired 14 businesses, which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	The following table sets forth our statement of operations for the years ended December 31:
1442145_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance for the years ended December 31:
1442145_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended December 31:
1442145_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(1) During the second quarter of 2011, we reevaluated the probability of D2Hawkeye and Strategic Analytics achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets for exceptional performance in fiscal year 2011 and reversed the contingent consideration related to these acquisitions.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, we reevaluated the probability of TierMed achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed its contingent consideration related to this acquisition.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	(2) In conjunction with the IPO, the stock of Insurance Services Office, Inc. converted to stock of Verisk Analytics, Inc, which effected a fifty-to-one stock split of its common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	The numbers in the above table reflect this stock split.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	(3) EBITDA is the financial measure which management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P5_S2	In the second quarter of 2012, we changed our definition of EBITDA such that it only reflects the definition noted and no longer excludes investment income/ (loss) and realized gain/ (loss) on securities, net for all periods presented.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P5_S3	In addition, this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P5_S4	See Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report Form 10-K.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P7_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P8_S0	(5) Prior to our corporate reorganization, we were required to record our Class A common stock and vested options at redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within our control, due to our contractual obligations to redeem these shares.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P8_S1	We classified this redemption value as redeemable common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P8_S2	After our IPO, we were no longer obligated to redeem these shares and therefore we reversed the redeemable common stock balance.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P9_S0	(6) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders deficit, as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_13_ITEM6_P9_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we repurchased $162.6 million and $380.7 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P C insurance, financial and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our IPO, Insurance Service Office, Inc., or ISO, formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	On October 6, 2009 in connection with our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by Class B insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning Class B common stock.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 37.8% and 42.3% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Effective December 31, 2012, we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industry-standard insurance programs within our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our Decision Analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework: Prediction of Loss, Detection and Prevention of Fraud, and Quantification of Loss.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	Effective December 31, 2011, we realigned the revenue categories within our Decision Analytics segment, including fraud identification and detection solutions, loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions, into four vertical market-related groupings of insurance, mortgage and financial services, healthcare, and specialized markets.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	We believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S6	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 62.2% and 57.7% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S7	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S8	We use year over year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S9	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 3.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P6_S10	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan, obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 32.8% and 31.1% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S6	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P9_S7	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Approximately 87.1% and 85.7% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Approximately 55.2% and 56.6% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	Personnel expenses, which represented 62.5% and 65.3% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S7	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S8	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S9	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S10	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S11	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S12	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S13	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S14	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S15	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S16	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S17	We serve customers in three primary vertical markets: property/casualty insurance, healthcare, and financial services.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P10_S18	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Growth in property/casualty insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.7% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 3.6% in 2011 and 4.4% through nine-months 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Based on reports of firming in insurance markets, and assuming modest growth in the economy, we expect premium growth at or above recent rates through 2013.Growth or decline in premiums for the lines of insurance for which we perform services could positively or negatively affect our revenues, because premium growth can affect the volume of solutions as well as the number and types of solutions our customers buy.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Also, we link the pricing of certain solutions in part to an individual customer s premiums from prior years.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The pricing for those solutions is fixed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	We have also signed multiyear contracts with certain customers, and for those customers, pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	A significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud both in claims and at policy inception could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Additionally, a significant change in insurers profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Trends in the U.S. healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	That market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform, expansion of insurance coverage, and efforts at cost containment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Payment reform will likely drive the market to value-based reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	The expansion of insurance eligibility will presumably increase Medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	And as the government seeks to control fraud, waste, and abuse, efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	Although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace, we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management, quality measurement, Medicare Advantage revenue intelligence and optimization, risk adjustment, and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Trends in the U.S. financial market can affect a portion of our revenues in the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The volume of applications for new mortgages or refinancing of existing mortgages can affect a portion of our mortgage-related revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	Based on estimates by the Mortgage Bankers Association as of January 15, 2013, we expect mortgage origination activity (new originations and refinancing) to decrease in 2013.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	That could have a negative effect on our revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	However, regulatory and economic conditions could also affect our revenues.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The current regulatory environment has created a flight to quality among residential lenders in the United States.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	That could create increased demand for our solutions that help customers focus on improved underwriting quality of mortgage loans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Conversely, a continued reduction of loan inventories related to foreclosures and early payment defaults may have an adverse effect on activities related to the analysis and curing of those loans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	In the payments industry, continued growth in debit and credit card usage could positively impact our financial services solutions revenue.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Description of Acquisitions We acquired nine businesses since January 1, 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, our consolidated results of operations may not be comparable between periods.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	On December 20, 2012, we acquired the net assets of Insurance Risk Management Solutions, or IRMS.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	IRMS provided integrated property risk assessment technology underlying one of our GIS (geographic information system) underwriting solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	At the end of 2012, this long-term contract (since 1992) with IRMS was expiring and precipitated a change in our business relationship.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Instead of continuing forward with a new services agreement, we acquired the technology and service assets of IRMS as this will enable us to better manage, enhance and continue to use the solutions as part of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	This acquisition had minimal revenue and operating expense impact for the year ending December 31, 2012, given the timing of the acquisition.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	On August 31, 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, a provider of information, competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions and regulators in North America, Latin America, and Europe.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	banks and other consumer financial services providers, payment processors, insurance companies, and other industry stakeholders.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, this acquisition enhances our position as a provider of data, analytics, and decision-support solutions to financial institutions globally.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	On July 2, 2012, we acquired the net assets of Aspect Loss Prevention, LLC, or ALP, a provider of loss prevention and analytic solutions to the retail, entertainment, and food industries.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, this acquisition further advances our position as a provider of data, crime analytics, and decision-support solutions.

1442145_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	In management s opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $94.7 million and $196.7 million, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees received in advance).
1442145_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our capital expenditures, which include non-cash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations, as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, were 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively.

1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	In prior years, we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	In April 2012, we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of $72.0 million, which resulted in a contribution of $78.8 million for the year, of which $28.2 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	As a result of the prefunding, we do not expect to make any contribution in 2013 with respect to our qualified pension plan.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	Under the postretirement plan, we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	In March 2012, we established a voluntary employee s beneficiary association plan, or VEBA plan, to fund the postretirement plan.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S6	We contributed $20.0 million to the VEBA Plan during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P59_S7	We expect to contribute approximately $1.1 million to the postretirement plan in 2013.

1442145_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	This increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expense payments, primarily related to the voluntary prefunding of our qualified pension plan in 2012, and interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2012.

1442145_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $17.9 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $3.7 million.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S6	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P71_S7	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S6	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S7	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S8	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S9	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S10	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P74_S11	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P75_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $1,768.4 million, which represents 74.9% of our total assets.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	During fiscal year 2012, we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2012 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $1,247.5 million as of December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S4	On January 12, 2012, we announced a hard freeze, which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P79_S5	The freeze was instituted on February 29, 2012 to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2012, we determined this rate to be 3.98%, a decrease of 1.00% from the 4.98% rate used at December 31, 2011.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P81_S8	Our postretirement rate is 2.75% at December 31, 2012, a decrease of 0.75% from the 3.50% used at December 31, 2011.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the plan assets were allocated 41.00% debt, 57.90% equity securities, and 1.10% to other investments.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increase and is no longer applicable in future expense analysis as the pension and post retirement plans were frozen as of February 29, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of $2.4 million as of December 31, 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	A one percent change in discount rate, future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects: Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	As a result of the implementation of this interpretation, we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.3 million, which was accounted for as an increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings (accumulated deficit).
1442145_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $8.1 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2013, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $120.5 million, which will expire at various dates from 2013 through 2032.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows: As of December 31, 2012, deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $40.8 million and $40.2 million were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	Other increases in deferred tax liabilities in 2012 of $56.7 million were primarily due to increased contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in the current period as well as the other timing differences attributable to depreciation and amortization.
1442145_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(s) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of $10.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.250% to 1.875% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility.
1442145_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2012, a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of $0.1 million based on our current level of borrowings.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC ( Argus ), which was acquired on August 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	The excluded financial statements of the acquisition constitutes approximately 1.9% of total assets, 1.4% of total revenues, and 0.7% of net income included within our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for Argus.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Verisk Analytics, Inc. Jersey City, New Jersey We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_13_ITEM8_P4_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Verisk Analytics, Inc. Jersey City, New Jersey We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC ( Argus ), which was acquired on August 31, 2012 and whose financial statements constitute 1.9% of total assets, 1.4% of total revenues, and 0.7% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Argus.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P6_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P7_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

1442145_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	The reconciliation between the Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the statutory tax rate is as follows for the years ended December 31: The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to benefits resulting from the successful execution of tax planning strategies.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to favorable settlements and resolution of uncertain tax positions, as well as a decrease in deferred taxes and a corresponding increase in tax expense in 2010 of $2,362 resulting from reduced tax benefits of Medicare subsidies associated with legislative changes in 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P106_S2	The tax effects of significant items comprising the Company s deferred tax assets as of December 31 are as follows:

1442145_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Equity will increase by $3,370 if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company uses tax law ordering for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	The federal government currently provides a subsidy on a tax free basis to companies that provide certain retiree prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part D Subsidy).
1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	As a result of a change in taxability of the federal subsidy which becomes effective January 1, 2013, the Company recorded a non-cash income tax charge and a decrease to deferred tax assets of $2,362 in 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	As of December 31, 2012, deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $40,836 and $40,244 were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus, respectively.

1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S5	The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S6	The Company has provided for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the capital loss carryforwards expiring in 2014 and the net operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P111_S7	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	A valuation allowance has been established for the capital loss carryforwards and foreign net operating losses based on the Company s evaluation of the likelihood of utilizing these benefits before they expire.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Company has determined that the generation of future taxable income from certain foreign subsidiaries to fully realize the deferred tax assets is uncertain.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P112_S2	Other than these items, the Company has determined, based on the Company s historical operating performance, that taxable income of the Company will more likely than not be sufficient to fully realize the deferred tax assets.

1442145_13_ITEM8_P112_S6	Consequently, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes or associated withholding taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P112_S7	The Company follows ASC 740-10, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize within the financial statements.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	No benefits may be recognized for tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, $10,103, $9,939 and $14,770, respectively, represent the amounts that, if recognized, would have a favorable effect on the Company s effective tax rate in any future periods.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P114_S1	The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $3,728, $4,690 and $7,753, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P114_S2	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of Provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P114_S3	The Company does not expect a significant increase in unrecognized benefits related to federal, foreign, or state tax exposures within the coming year.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P114_S4	In addition, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $8,077 of its currently remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2013 as a result of a combination of audit settlements and lapses of statute of limitations, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in various state and foreign jurisdictions.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	The Company joined by its domestic subsidiaries, files a consolidated income tax return for the Federal income tax purposes.

1442145_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	The volatility factor was based on the average volatility of the Company s peers, calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most recent period is commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards.

1442145_13_ITEM8_P167_S4	The asset allocation at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and target allocation for 2013 by asset category are as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the Pension Plan.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P169_S1	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P169_S2	The Company believes that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P169_S3	These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P169_S4	The following table summarizes the fair value measurements by level of the Pension Plan and Postretirement Plan assets:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	(1) Valued at the closing price of shares for domestic stocks within the managed equity accounts, and valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) of shares for mutual funds at either the closing price reported in the active market or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings for corporate bonds held by the Plan in these managed accounts.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	(2) The pooled separate accounts invest in domestic and foreign stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P171_S1	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the pooled separate account, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	(3) Investments for which readily determinable prices do not exist are valued by the General Partner using either the market or income approach.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	In establishing the estimated fair value of investments, including those without readily determinable values, the General Partner assumes a reasonable period of time for liquidation of the investment, and takes into consideration the financial condition and operating results of the underlying portfolio company, nature of investment, restrictions on marketability, holding period, market conditions, foreign currency exposures, and other factors the General Partner deems appropriate.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	(4) The fund invested in the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities or securities that are rated AAA by S P, AAA by Fitch, or Aaa by Moody s, including but not limited to mortgage securities such as agency and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and other obligations that are secured by mortgages or mortgage backed securities, and valued at the closing price reported in the active market.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	The following table sets forth a summary of changes in fair value of the Pension Plan s Level 3 assets for the years ended December 31:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	Segment Reporting ASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( ASC 280-10 ), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P176_S1	ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company s CEO and Chairman of the Board is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280-10.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	To align with the internal management of the Company s business operations based on service offerings, the Company is organized into the following two operating segments, which are also the Company s reportable segments: Decision Analytics:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company develops solutions that its customers use to analyze key processes in managing risk.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company s combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary data to generate solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P178_S2	In most cases, the Company s customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company also develops solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P179_S2	Fraud solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of mortgage applications to identify misinformation, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance, mortgage and healthcare sectors.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	insurance, financial services, healthcare and specialized markets.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P180_S1	Previously, the Company disclosed revenue based on the classification of its solution as fraud identification and detection solutions, loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P180_S2	There have been no changes in reportable segments in accordance with ASC 280-10 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company is the leading provider of statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	The Company s databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S2	The Company uses this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S3	Effective December 31, 2012, the Company combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industry-standard insurance programs within the Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S4	There have been no changes in reportable segments in accordance with ASC 280-10 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S5	The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments for which separate discrete financial information is available and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S6	The Company uses EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S7	EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P181_S8	In the second quarter of 2012, the Company changed its definition of EBITDA such that it only reflects the definition noted and no longer excludes investment income and realized (loss) gain on securities, net, for all periods presented.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	EBITDA is the measure of operating results used to assess corporate performance and optimal utilization of debt and acquisitions.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P182_S2	Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P182_S3	The Company does not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	On a geographic basis, no individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 1.00% or more of the Company s consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	No individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 1.00% or more of total consolidated long-term assets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following table provides the Company s revenue and operating income performance by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, as well as a reconciliation to income before income taxes for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	Operating segment revenue by type of service is provided below for the years ended December 31:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	Related Parties: The Company considers its Class A stockholders that own more than 5% of the outstanding stock within the respective class to be related parties as defined within ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures .
1442145_13_ITEM8_P187_S1	The Company had no related parties owning more than 5% of the entire class of stock as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P187_S2	In addition, the Company had revenues from related parties for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 of $0, $13,882 and $49,788, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P187_S3	The Company incurred expenses associated with the payment of insurance coverage premiums to certain of the related parties aggregating $0, $0 and $41 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P187_S4	These costs are included in Cost of revenues and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	Commitments and Contingencies: The Company s operations are conducted on leased premises.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P188_S1	Approximate minimum rentals under long-term noncancelable leases for all leased premises, computer equipment and automobiles are as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	Most of the leases require payment of property taxes and utilities and, in certain cases, contain renewal options.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	Operating leases consist of office space.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	Capital leases consist of computer equipment, office equipment, and leased automobiles.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S2	Rent expense on operating leases approximated $29,618, $27,902 and $23,898 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S3	In addition, the Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including the matters described below.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S4	With respect to ongoing matters, the Company is unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S5	This is primarily because the matters are in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P190_S6	Although the Company believes it has strong defenses and intends to vigorously defend these matters, the Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	Citizens Insurance Litigation On February 28, 2012, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the Florida State Circuit Court for Pasco County naming Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ( Citizens ) and the Company s Xactware subsidiary.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	The complaint alleged a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants and was brought on behalf of all individuals who have purchased a new or renewed a property casualty insurance policy from Citizens where Citizens used Xactware s 360Value product to determine replacement value of the property.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S2	On March 12, 2012, plaintiffs served their First Amended Complaint additionally alleging : (1) that Citizens and Xactware knowingly made false statements to the plaintiff class concerning their properties replacement cost values; (2) fraud against Xactware based on its alleged misrepresentation of the replacement value of plaintiffs properties; (3) conspiracy against Citizens and Xactware based on their alleged artificial inflation of the value of plaintiffs properties; and (4) products liability against Xactware, claiming Xactware defectively designed 360Value as used in the Florida insurance market.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S3	The First Amended Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified monetary damages alleged to be in excess of $1,000 for the class.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S4	On May 31, 2012 plaintiff served his Second Amended Complaint which no longer alleged a class action, but continued to allege: (1) that Citizens and Xactware artificially inflated the replacement cost value of plaintiff s property using 360Value; (2) fraud by Xactware; (3) a conspiracy between Citizens and Xactware; and (4) products liability against Xactware.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S5	The Second Amended Complaint similarly sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages representing the difference between the premium plaintiff paid to Citizens using 360Value and what the premium should have been if Citizens used an accurate replacement cost value for plaintiff s property.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S6	Defendants motion to transfer was granted and the case was transferred to the Leon County Circuit Court on September 17, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P191_S7	Plaintiff dismissed all claims against Xactware on November 26, 2012.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	Litigation On April 20, 2012, the Company was served with a class action complaint filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California naming the Company s subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. ( Intellicorp ) titled Jane Roe v. Intellicorp Records, Inc.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P192_S1	The complaint alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and claimed that Intellicorp failed to implement reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the adverse information contained in the background reports, failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that criminal record information provided to employers is complete and up to date, and failed to notify class members contemporaneously of the fact that criminal record information was being provided to their employers and prospective employers.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	The District Court later granted Intellicorp s motion to transfer the case, which is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	On October 24, 2012 plaintiffs served their First Amended Complaint (the Roe Complaint ) alleging a nationwide putative class action on behalf of all persons who were the subject of a Criminal SuperSearch or other instant consumer background report furnished to a third party by Intellicorp for employment purposes, and whose report contained any negative public record of criminal arrest, charge, or conviction without also disclosing the final disposition of the charges during the 5 years preceding the filing of this action through the date class certification is granted.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	The Roe Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P194_S2	On February 4, 2013, the District Court granted plaintiffs motion to amend the Roe Complaint to eliminate the named plaintiff s individual claim for compensatory damages.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P194_S3	This amendment did not change the breadth or scope of the request for relief sought on behalf of the proposed class.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	On November 1, 2012, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio naming the Company s subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. titled Michael R. Thomas v. Intellicorp Records, Inc.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P195_S1	On January 7, 2013 plaintiff served its First Amended Complaint (the Thomas Complaint ) to add Mark A. Johnson (the plaintiff in the Johnson v. iiX matter described below) as a named plaintiff.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P195_S2	The Thomas Complaint alleges a nationwide putative class action for violations of FCRA on behalf of [a]ll natural persons residing in the United States (a) who were the subject of a report sold by Intellicorp to a third party, (b) that was furnished for an employment purpose, (c) that contained at least one public record of a criminal conviction or arrest, civil lien, bankruptcy or civil judgment, (d) within five years next preceding the filing of this action and during its pendency, and (e) to whom Intellicorp did not place in the United States mail postage-prepaid, on the day it furnished any part of the report, a written notice that it was furnishing the subject report and containing the name of the person that was to receive the report.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P195_S3	The Thomas Complaint proposes an alternative subclass as follows:
1442145_13_ITEM8_P195_S4	[a]ll natural persons residing in Ohio or Tennessee (a) who were the subject of a report sold by Intellicorp to a third party, (b) that was furnished for an employment purpose, (c) that contained at least one public record of a criminal conviction or arrest, civil lien, bankruptcy or civil judgment, (d) within five years next preceding the filing of this action and during its pendency, (e) when a mutual review of the record would reveal that the identity associated with the public record does not match the identity of the class member about whom the report was furnished, and (f) to whom Intellicorp did not place in the United States mail postage pre-paid, on the day it furnished any part of the report, a written notice that it was furnishing the subject report and containing the name of the person that was to receive the report.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	Similar to the Roe action, the Thomas Complaint alleges that Intellicorp violated the FCRA, asserting that Intellicorp violated section 1681k(a)(1) of the FCRA because it failed to provide notice to the plaintiffs at the time the adverse public record information was reported.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	The named plaintiffs also allege individual claims under section 1681e(b) claiming that Intellicorp failed to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in the preparation of the consumer report it furnished pertaining to plaintiffs.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Thomas Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees, as well as compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the named plaintiffs.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	iiX Litigation On January 3, 2013 the Company received service of a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio naming the Company s subsidiary Insurance Information Exchange ( iiX ) titled Mark A. Johnson v. Insurance Information Exchange, LLC (the Johnson Complaint ) .
1442145_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	prior to the filing of this Complaint and to whom iiX did not provide notice of the fact that public record information which is likely to have an adverse effect upon the consumer s ability to obtain employment, is being reported by iiX, together with the name and address of the person to whom such information is being reported at the time such public record information is reported to the user of such consumer report.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	Similar to the Thomas matter, the Johnson Complaint alleges violations of section 1681k(a) of the FCRA claiming that iiX failed to notify customers contemporaneously that criminal record information was provided to a prospective employer and failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that the information reported is complete and up to date.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	The Johnson Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_13_ITEM8_P200_S2	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to these matters.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our customers use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P1_S6	We believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	These four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers operations:
1442145_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims departments, independent adjustors and contractors.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	We add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented approximately 73.6% of our revenues in 2013 .

1442145_14_ITEM1_P3_S6	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our History We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P4_S5	Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	To further expand our Decision Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2004, we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2005, we entered the mortgage sector, acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection, compliance and decision support solutions for the U.S. mortgage industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S5	In 2011 and 2012, we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring Health Risk Partners, LLC, or HRP, which provides solutions to optimize revenue, improve compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage health plans and MediConnect Global, Inc. or MediConnect, which provides medical record retrieval, digitization, coding, extraction, and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S6	Also in 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, to expand our presence in providing information, competitive benchmarking, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S7	These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P6_S8	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	In January 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Eagleview Technology Corporation, or EVT, the parent company of Pictometry International Corp., and Eagle View Technologies, Inc. for a net cash purchase price of $650 million, which will be funded by the Company's operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	EVT is a provider of geo-referenced aerial image capture and visual-centric data analytics and solutions to insurers, contractors, government, and commercial customers in the United States.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	This acquisition is expected to advance our position in the imagery analytics market, adding new municipal and commercial customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	The transaction is expected to support the aerial imagery solution development in our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S4	The parties expect the transaction to close by July 2014, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P7_S5	Once the acquisition is completed, we plan to include EVT in the insurance vertical of our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	In February 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our mortgage services business, Interthinx, Inc., or Interthinx.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 31, 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our senior management team, which includes our president and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, and five senior officers who lead our business and operational units, have been with us for an average of over 18 years.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new vertical markets, including healthcare, financial services, and supply chain.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the Company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Verisk Class A common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our Risk Analysis Framework: prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	To meet their needs, we process and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in excess of 3,000 filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S6	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P13_S7	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed or appointed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S8	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 2.9 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P14_S9	We maintain a database of over 17.3 billion statistical records, including approximately 7.0 billion commercial lines records and approximately 10.3 billion personal lines records.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S5	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S6	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.5 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on more than 6.2 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S7	We have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S8	Each year, our field staff visits more than over 325,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S9	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S10	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S11	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 47,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S12	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S13	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S14	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P17_S15	We also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with people they lend against.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of our Risk Analysis Framework.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	We develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and quantify losses.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	The businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	We believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers) which helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our database contains information on approximately 921 million claims and is the world s largest database of P C claims information used for claims and investigations.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claims , more than 210,000 a day on average, across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We also provide an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in more than 90 countries.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	We also provide data, analytic and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	We provide solutions for every phase of a building s life, including:
1442145_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters, contractors and policyholders.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	To help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 467 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	We revise this information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 17,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys, and an analysis of the actual claims experience of our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	We estimate that about 80% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	Utilization of such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P31_S14	Our approach combines computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P31_S15	We run our customers claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse, physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P31_S16	This combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians, physicians practices, hospitals, dentists, and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	After a suspicious source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations, including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers.

1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S3	Competitors also include other statistical agents, including the National Independent Statistical Service, the Independent Statistical Service and other advisory organizations, providing underwriting rules, prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the American Association of Insurance Services and Mutual Services Organization, although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S4	Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys, including Overland Solutions, Inc. and Regional Reporting, Inc.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S5	We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S6	In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S7	Our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors, management and strategy consulting firms including Deloitte Consulting LLP, and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including Pinnacle Consulting and EMB, a unit of Towers Watson.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S8	Decision Analytics Competitors In the P C insurance claims market and catastrophe modeling market, certain products are offered by a number of companies, including Risk Management Solutions (catastrophe modeling) and CoreLogic, LexisNexis Risk Solutions (loss histories and motor vehicle records for personal lines underwriting), Decision Insight or MSB (property value and claims estimator), and Solera (personal automobile underwriting).
1442145_14_ITEM1_P39_S9	We believe that our P C insurance industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against these competitors with more limited offerings.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	In the healthcare market, certain products are offered by a number of companies, including Computer Sciences Corporation (evaluation of bodily injury and workers compensation claims), Fair Isaac Corporation (workers compensation and healthcare claims cost containment) and OptumInsight, McKesson, Truven Health Analytics, Inovalon, and iHealth (healthcare predictive modeling and business intelligence).
1442145_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Competitive factors include application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and price.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Development of New Solutions We take a market-focused team approach to developing our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our operating units are responsible for developing, reviewing and enhancing our various products and services.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our data management and production team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production and quality control.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	Our Joint Development Environment, or JDE, and Enterprise Data Management, or EDM, teams support our efforts to create new information and products from available data and explores new methods of collecting data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	EDM is focused on understanding and documenting business-unit and corporate data assets and data issues; sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise; creating an enterprise data strategy; facilitating research and product development; and promoting cross-enterprise communication.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our Verisk Innovative Analytics, or VIA, team is a corporate center of excellence for analytical methods in applying modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our software development teams build the technology used in many of our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	As part of our product-development process, we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our products and services and the market s needs.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	We have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels, which meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	In addition, we use frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and other industry forums to gather information to match the needs of the market with our product development efforts.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our clients and the markets in which they operate.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	We also add to our offerings through an active acquisition program.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S7	Since 2009, we have acquired twelve businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S8	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P42_S9	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and sales support.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we had a sales force of 285 people.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical product sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers, we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Tier One or National Accounts constitutes our largest customers, Tier Two or Strategic Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market carriers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	Tier Three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business and/or be one-state or regional writers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	A Sales Generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P45_S4	Our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Sales people participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	These agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P49_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Sixth, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	Lastly, we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices under agreements between our insurer customers and their provider networks.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our costs for data received from our customers were 1.3% and 1.4% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,289 employees.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and Orem, Utah creating redundancy and back-up capabilities.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S6	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units, located in other states.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S7	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S8	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P52_S9	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S5	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S6	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S7	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S8	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P55_S9	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we employed 6,368 full-time and 727 part-time employees.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our employees include over 190 actuarial professionals, including 49 Fellows and 25 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 158 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 18 Certified and 23 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and 530 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S5	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S6	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P59_S7	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P60_S5	To access these, click on the Financial Information SEC" link found on our Investor Relations homepage.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	The public may read and copy any materials filed by Verisk with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1442145_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest any of our securities.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our securities including our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S7	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Specifically, a portion of Class A common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , approximately 47.4% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A downturn in the insurance industry, filing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S10	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S11	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance and healthcare services sector.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S13	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S15	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue,we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P6_S16	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S12	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S13	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S14	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S15	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S16	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P9_S18	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, customers , employees or other s misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our contemplated acquisition of Eagleview Technology Corporation will increase our leverage; in addition, we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	On January 14, 2014, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire Eagleview Technology Corporation ('EVT'), the closing of which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In order to finance the acquisition we expect to incur approximately $475 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Upon closing of the transaction, our total debt will increase to approximately $1,756 million and our leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA (last twelve months proforma)) will increase from 1.60 to approximately 2.15.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our increased leverage resulting from the EVT acquisition could adversely affect our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	In addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S11	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S13	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S14	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S15	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over 18 years.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S16	However, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S17	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S18	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S19	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S20	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S21	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S22	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S23	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S24	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P17_S25	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and related obligations.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S8	This decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , our ten largest shareholders owned 46.4% of our Class A common stock including 8.9% of our Class A common stock owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,947,727 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of February 21, 2014 .
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 21 states in the United States, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Nepal, and Singapore.
1442145_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Litigation and iiX Litigation On April 20, 2012, we were served with a class action complaint filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California naming our subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. ( Intellicorp ) titled Jane Roe v. Intellicorp Records, Inc.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and claimed that Intellicorp failed to implement reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the adverse information contained in the background reports, failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that criminal record information provided to employers is complete and up to date, and failed to notify class members contemporaneously of the fact that criminal record information was being provided to their employers and prospective employers.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	Intellicorp removed the case to the United States District Court of the Northern District of California.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	The California Court later granted Intellicorp s motion to transfer the case, which is now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

1442145_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Roe Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	On February 4, 2013, the Court granted plaintiffs motion to amend the Roe Complaint to eliminate the named plaintiff s individual claim for compensatory damages.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	This amendment did not change the breadth or scope of the request for relief sought on behalf of the proposed class.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	This amendment reduces the size of the potential class, but does not alter the time period for which the plaintiffs seek to certify a class or the scope of the request for relief sought on behalf of the proposed class.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	Plaintiffs motion for class certification was fully submitted on March 18, 2013 and oral argument was heard by Judge Gwin on June 27, 2013.

1442145_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	Similar to the Roe action, the Thomas Complaint alleges that Intellicorp violated the FCRA, asserting that Intellicorp violated section 1681k(a)(1) of the FCRA because it failed to provide notice to the plaintiffs at the time the adverse public record information was reported.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	The named plaintiffs also allege individual claims under section 1681e(b) claiming that Intellicorp failed to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in the preparation of the consumer report it furnished pertaining to plaintiffs.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P6_S0	The Thomas Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees, as well as compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the named plaintiffs.

1442145_14_ITEM3_P7_S2	Similar to the Thomas matter, the Johnson Complaint alleges violations of section 1681k(a) of the FCRA claiming that iiX failed to notify customers contemporaneously that criminal record information was provided to a prospective employer and failed to maintain strict procedures to ensure that the information reported is complete and up to date.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P7_S3	The Johnson Complaint seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P7_S4	On October 18, 2013, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement resolving the Roe, Thomas and Johnson matters which Judge Gwin approved on October 29, 2013 subject to a hearing on Final Approval.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P7_S5	The Stipulation of Settlement provides for a payment of $18.6 million all of which is to be provided by insurance.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P7_S6	Accordingly, if the Stipulation of Settlement is approved at the hearing on Final Approval, the settlement of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on us.

1442145_14_ITEM3_P19_S3	The Amended Complaint seeks declaratory, equitable and injunctive relief enjoining the enforcement of the Unlawful Amendment and ordering the pension plan and ISO retroactive to the date of the Unlawful Amendment to recalculate the accrued benefits of all class members, indemnification from ISO to the pension plan for costs and contribution requirements related to voiding the Unlawful Amendment, bonuses to the class representatives, costs and attorney s fees.

1442145_14_ITEM3_P21_S3	It further alleges that the Mazda was rebuilt and auctioned through a multi-state salvage reseller and sold to defendant Kendall (the driver) and that prior to purchase Kendall consulted Carfax s Vehicle History Report which guaranteed no problem with the Mazda s title and that it was not junk, neither salvage nor rebuilt.
1442145_14_ITEM3_P21_S4	As a result, the Amended Petition alleges that Carfax s report was in error and it sets forth a claim for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, gross negligence, strict liability, breach of contract and fraud against defendants Nationwide Insurance, Carfax and ISO in addition to the negligence claims against defendants General and Import Motors and Kendall and Hayward.

1442145_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013 we acquired 12 businesses, which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	The amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations of our mortgage services business.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	The following table sets forth our statement of operations for the years ended December 31:
1442145_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance for the years ended December 31:
1442145_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended December 31:
1442145_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	(1) During the second quarter of 2011, we reevaluated the probability of D2Hawkeye and Strategic Analytics achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets for exceptional performance in fiscal year 2011 and reversed the contingent consideration related to these acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, we reevaluated the probability of TierMed achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed its contingent consideration related to this acquisition.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	(2) As of December 31, 2013, we finalized our plans to sell our mortgage services business.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report Form 10-K. (3) EBITDA is the financial measure which management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P5_S2	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P5_S3	In the second quarter of 2012, we changed our definition of EBITDA such that it only reflects the definition noted and no longer excludes investment income (loss) and realized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net for all periods presented.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P5_S4	In addition, this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues from continuing and discontinued operations.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report Form 10-K.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P7_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P7_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P8_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P8_S1	Please note because EBITDA is calculated from net income, this presentation includes EBITDA from discontinued operations of our mortgage services business.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P8_S2	(5) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization on October 6, 2009, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders equity (deficit), as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_14_ITEM6_P8_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we repurchased $278.9 million and $162.6 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks and opportunities associated with those risks.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P C insurance, financial services and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S6	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our IPO, Insurance Service Office, Inc., or ISO, formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	On October 6, 2009 in connection with our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by Class B insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning Class B common stock.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 38.7% and 41.2% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Effective December 31, 2012, we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industry-standard insurance programs within our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	to analyze the processes of the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework: Prediction of Loss, Detection and Prevention of Fraud, and Quantification of Loss.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Effective December 31, 2011, we realigned the revenue categories within our Decision Analytics segment, including fraud identification and detection solutions, loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions, into four vertical market-related groupings of insurance, financial services, healthcare, and specialized markets.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 61.3% and 58.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	In January 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Eagleview Technology Corporation ( EVT ), the parent company of Pictometry International Corp., and Eagle View Technologies, Inc. for a net cash purchase price of $650 million, which will be funded by the Company's operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	EVT is a provider of geo-referenced aerial image capture and visual-centric data analytics and solutions to insurers, contractors, government, and commercial customers in the United States.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	This acquisition is expected to advance our position in the imagery analytics market, adding new municipal and commercial customers.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	The transaction is expected to support the aerial imagery solution development in our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	The parties expect the transaction to close by July 2014, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	Once the acquisition is completed, we plan to include EVT in the insurance vertical of our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In February 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our mortgage services business.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 31, 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	From 2009 to 2011, the mortgage services business was in both Risk Assessment segment within the insurance services revenue category and Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	In 2012, we reclassified the appraisal mortgage tools from Risk Assessment to our Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Therefore, in 2012 and 2013, the mortgage services business is within Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report Form 10-K. As necessary, all amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to this discontinued operations.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	We use year over year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 3.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , 26.4% and 27.6% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Approximately 88.2% and 87.1% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	Approximately 64.4% and 62.1% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	Personnel expenses, which represented 59.7% and 62.6% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S8	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S9	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S10	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S11	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S12	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S13	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S14	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S15	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S16	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S17	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S18	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S19	We serve customers in three primary vertical markets: property/casualty insurance, healthcare, and financial services.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P15_S20	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Growth in property/casualty insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.7% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012 and 4.1% through nine-months 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Based on reports of firming in insurance markets, and assuming modest growth in the economy, we expect premium growth near recent rates through 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Growth or decline in premiums for the lines of insurance for which we perform services could positively or negatively affect our revenues, because premium growth can affect the volume of solutions as well as the number and types of solutions our customers buy.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	Also, we link the invoices of certain solutions in part to an individual customer s premiums from prior years for a portion of our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	The pricing for those solutions is fixed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	We have also signed multiyear contracts with certain customers, and for those customers, pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	A significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud both in claims and at policy inception could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additionally, a significant change in insurers profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Trends in the U.S. healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	That market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform, expansion of insurance coverage, and efforts at cost containment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Payment reform will likely drive the market to value-based reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	The expansion of insurance eligibility will increase Medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	And as the government seeks to control fraud, waste, and abuse, efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	Although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace, we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management, quality measurement, Medicare Advantage revenue management and compliance, risk adjustment, and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S7	We experience seasonality in our Medicare Advantage business tied to third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, related to CMS deadlines.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S8	Description of Acquisitions We acquired six businesses since January 1, 2011.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P18_S9	As a result of these acquisitions, our consolidated results of operations may not be comparable between periods.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	On December 20, 2012, we acquired the net assets of Insurance Risk Management Solutions, or IRMS.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	IRMS provided integrated property risk assessment technology underlying one of our GIS (geographic information system) underwriting solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	At the end of 2012, this long-term contract (since 1992) with IRMS was expiring and precipitated a change in our business relationship.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Instead of continuing forward with a new services agreement, we acquired the technology and service assets of IRMS as this will enable us to better manage, enhance and continue to use the solutions as part of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	This acquisition had minimal revenue and operating expense impact for the year ending December 31, 2012, given the timing of the acquisition.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	See Note 9. to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	On August 31, 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, a provider of information, competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions and regulators in North America, Latin America, and Europe.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Argus leverages its comprehensive payment data sets and provides proprietary solutions to a client base that includes credit and debit card issuers, retail banks and other consumer financial services providers, payment processors, insurance companies, and other industry stakeholders.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Within our Decision Analytics segment, this acquisition enhances our position as a provider of data, analytics, and decision-support solutions to financial institutions globally.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.

1442145_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	On March 30, 2012, we acquired 100% of the stock of MediConnect Global, Inc., or MediConnect, a service provider of medical record retrieval, digitization, coding, extraction, and analysis.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, MediConnect further supports our objective to be the leading provider of data, analytics, and decision-support solutions to the healthcare and property casualty industries.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the preliminary purchase allocation.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	On June 17, 2011, we acquired the net assets of Health Risk Partners, LLC, or HRP, a provider of solutions to optimize revenue, improve compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage health plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, this acquisition further advances our position as a major provider of data, analytics, and decision-support solutions to the healthcare industry.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	On April 27, 2011, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Bloodhound Technologies, Inc. or Bloodhound, a provider of real-time pre-adjudication medical claims editing.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Within our Decision Analytics segment, Bloodhound addresses the need of healthcare payers to control fraud and waste in a real-time claims-processing environment, and these capabilities align with our existing fraud identification tools.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	In February 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our mortgage services business, Interthinx, for a price of $155.0 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 31, 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report Form 10-K.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Revenues Revenues were $1,595.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $1,407.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $187.9 million or 13.3%.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	In 2012 , we acquired MediConnect, ALP, and Argus, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	MediConnect was included as a recent acquisition only for the first quarter of 2013; ALP was included as a recent acquisition in the first and second quarters of 2013; Argus was included as a recent acquisition in the first, second and third quarters of 2013 as full quarter comparable revenues did not exist until certain quarters of 2012 due to the timing of the acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	These recent acquisitions were within our Decision Analytics segment and provided an increase of $68.1 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $119.8 million or 8.5% , which included an increase in our Decision Analytics segment of $81.0 million or 9.8% and an increase in our Risk Assessment segment of $38.8 million or 6.7%.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	Revenue growth within Decision Analytics was primarily driven by increases in our healthcare revenue category and contributions from our insurance revenue category.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	Both categories, industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific rating and underwriting information, within Risk Assessment contributed to its revenue growth.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	Refer to the Results of Continuing Operations by Segment within this section for further information regarding our revenues.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S7	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues was $622.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $516.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $105.8 million or 20.5% .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S8	Recent acquisitions all within the Decision Analytics segment, accounted for an increase of $36.8 million in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 which were primarily related to salaries and employee benefits.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S9	Excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $69.0 million or 13.4%.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S10	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $36.6 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S11	Other increases include data costs and data processing fees of $17.7 million, information technology expense of $7.4 million, travel and travel related costs of $3.2 million and other operating costs of $4.1 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S12	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA, were $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $220.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $8.9 million or 4.1% .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S13	Recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of $3.8 million, which was primarily related to professional fees.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P30_S14	Excluding costs associated with our recent acquisitions, SGA increased $5.1 million or 2.3%.

1442145_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Risk Assessment segment were $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , a decrease of $1.4 million or 1.7%.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P46_S5	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $2.0 million, primarily related to lower pension cost.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P46_S6	Other decreases included professional fees of $1.4 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P46_S7	These decreases were offset by an increase in other general expenses of $2.0 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 54.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 51.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies achieved in 2012.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	In addition, we reallocated certain resources related to property appraisal tools to Decision Analytics, which partially attributed to our margin expansion.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	for a fair presentation of this data.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $169.7 million and $94.7 million, respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees received in advance).
1442145_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our capital expenditures, which include non-cash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations, as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , were 9.2% and 5.2%, respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	We estimate our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $147.0 million, which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S5	We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S6	We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P56_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we repurchased $278.9 million, $162.6 million and $380.7 million, respectively, of our common stock.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	In prior years, we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	In April 2012, we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of $72.0 million, which resulted in a contribution of $78.8 million for the year, of which $28.2 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	As a result of the prefunding, we do not expect to make any contribution in 2014 with respect to our qualified pension plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	Under the postretirement plan, we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S5	In March 2012, we established a voluntary employee s beneficiary association plan, or VEBA plan, to fund the postretirement plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S6	We contributed $20.0 million to the VEBA Plan during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S7	We expect to contribute approximately $1.8 million to the postretirement plan in 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S8	We had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $1,265.1 million and $1,454.4 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P57_S9	The debt at December 31, 2013 was primarily issued under senior notes and long-term private placement loan facilities to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	On April 6, 2011, we completed an issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	These senior notes are due on May 1, 2021 and accrue interest at a rate of 5.800% per annum.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1st and November 1st of each year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	On December 8, 2011, we completed a second issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal of $250.0 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	These senior notes are due on January 15, 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.875% per annum.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S5	Interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S6	On September 12, 2012, we completed a third issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S7	These senior notes are due on September 12, 2022 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.125% per annum.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P58_S8	Interest is payable semi-annually on March 12th and September 12th of each year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	We expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy, including for general corporate purposes and acquisitions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	On October 25, 2013, we amended our committed senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks to increase the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from $850.0 million to $975.0 million and extend the maturity date from October 24, 2017 to October 24, 2018.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	We amortize all one-time fees and third party costs associated with the execution and amendment of this credit facility through the maturity date.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Interest is payable at a maturity rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.875%, depending on the result of certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Verisk and ISO are co-borrowers under the credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility, compared to $10.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2012.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	We repaid the $10.0 million of outstanding borrowings from 2012 in January 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	We did not have any additional borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	As of December 31, 2013, we have an available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit, of $973.1 million under the credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	We expect to finance a portion of the cash purchase price of the EVT acquisition with borrowings from our credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P61_S7	EVT is expected to close by July 2014.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	These covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters, we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 3.5 to 1.0.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	We had long-term private placement loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with New York Life and Prudential Capital Group that expired during 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S5	We did not renew these agreements and no longer have financing capacity thereunder.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we repaid $180.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the private placement facilities that matured during the year with cash from operations.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S7	The notes outstanding under these long-term private placement loan facilities mature over the next three years.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P62_S8	The weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 6.36% and 6.26% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and amounts outstanding were $1.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	These notes contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell assets to another company.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	These notes also contain financial covenants that require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of December 31, 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $506.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $468.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers, partially offset by an increase in interest payments related to our bond offerings.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	In the second quarter of 2012, we pre-funded $72.0 million to our pension plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	This prefunding was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with those deductible contributions and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 tax payment to 2013 as a result of a temporary federal tax relief program related to Hurricane Sandy.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	This tax payment would have typically been paid in the fourth quarter of 2012, but due to this relief, the payment was made in the first quarter of 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $468.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $375.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	federal tax relief program related to Hurricane Sandy.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	This increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expense payments, primarily related to the voluntary prefunding of our qualified pension plan in 2012, and interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $883.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the fact that we had acquisitions in 2012 with a combined net cash purchase price of $808.3 million versus minor acquisition activity in 2013.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	Net cash used in investing activities was $883.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S5	The increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to an increase in acquisition payments of $647.8 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus in the first and third quarters of 2012, respectively, an increase in escrow funding associated with these acquisitions of $19.2 million and an increase in purchases of fixed assets of $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S6	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $284.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and net cash provided by financing was $313.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S7	Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related the repurchase of common stock of $277.4 million and debt repayments of $190.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefit of $190.3 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S8	Net cash provided by financing activities was $313.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and net cash used in by financing was $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S9	Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily related to an increase in total net debt of $357.2 million, stock option exercises and the related tax benefit associated with these exercises of $129.1 million, partially offset by stock repurchases of $162.3 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P65_S10	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2013 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	(1) Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of our ESOP contributions and employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $9.5 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $2.6 million.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S9	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S10	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S11	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S12	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P68_S13	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P69_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $1,629.3 million, which represents 65.1% of our total assets.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $1,181.7 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2013 , we determined this rate to be 4.74%, an increase of 0.76% from the 3.98% rate used at December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P76_S8	Our postretirement rate is 3.45% at December 31, 2013 , an increase of 0.70% from the 2.75% used at December 31, 2012 .
1442145_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the pension plan assets were allocated 33.20% debt and 66.80% equity securities.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S5	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P78_S6	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1442145_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $3.9 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2014, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $79.7 million, which will expire at various dates from 2014 through 2033.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , deferred tax liabilities of $70.2 were recorded primarily attributable to timing differences involving pensions, depreciation and amortization.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $40.8 million and $40.2 million were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus, respectively.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	Other increases in deferred tax liabilities in 2012 of $56.7 million were primarily due to increased contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in the current period as well as the other timing differences attributable to depreciation and amortization.
1442145_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements F or a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(t) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2013 , we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.
1442145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Any future borrowing under this facility would bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.875%, depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , all of our debt is at fixed rates.

1442145_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992.

1442145_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_14_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P4_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1442145_14_ITEM8_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

1442145_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
1442145_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

1442145_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Our Company Verisk Analytics, Inc. is a leading provider of information about risk to professionals in insurance, healthcare, financial services, government, supply chain, and risk management.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on industry expertise and unique proprietary data sets to provide predictive analytics and decision-support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, profitability optimization, data management, and many other fields.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	In the United States and around the world, we help customers protect people, property, and financial assets.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our customers use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	We refer to these products and services as "solutions" due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	These "solutions" take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2014 , our customers included all of the top 100 Property and Casualty, or P C, insurance providers in the U.S. for the lines of P C services we offer, 29 of the top 30 credit card issuers in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as 9 of the top 10 health plan providers in the U.S.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	We believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	These four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers operations:
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims departments, independent adjustors and contractors.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	We add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented approximately 72.3% of our revenues in 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , we had revenues of $1,746.7 million and net income of $400.0 million .
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	For the five year period ended December 31, 2014 , our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 15.2% and 13.3%, respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	As further described below, results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P4_S6	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our History We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P5_S5	Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	To further expand our Decision Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2004, we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured employers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2005, we entered the mortgage sector, acquiring the first of several businesses that provided automated fraud detection, compliance and decision support solutions for the U.S. mortgage industry, which we sold in March 2014.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	In 2011 and 2012, we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring Health Risk Partners, LLC, or HRP, which provides solutions to optimize revenue, improve compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage health plans and MediConnect Global, Inc. or MediConnect, which provides medical record retrieval, digitization, coding, extraction, and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S6	Also in 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, to expand our presence in providing information, competitive benchmarking, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S7	Net Limited, or Maplecroft; as part of our risk management and supply chain solutions business, Maplecroft will continue to deliver thorough analyses of geopolitical, societal, human rights, economic, and environmental risks for many countries in the world.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S8	These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P7_S9	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the Company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	Verisk Class A common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	On March 11, 2014, we sold our mortgage services business, Interthinx, Inc., or Interthinx.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	From 2009 to 2011, the mortgage services business was in both Risk Assessment segment within the insurance services revenue category and Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	In 2012, we reclassified the appraisal mortgage tools from Risk Assessment to our Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	Therefore, in 2012 and 2013, the mortgage services business is within Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our senior management team, which includes our president and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, and six senior officers who lead our business and operational units, have been with us for an average of almost 18 years.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new vertical markets, including healthcare, financial services, and supply chain.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our Risk Analysis Framework: prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	To meet their needs, we process and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands approximately 3,000 regulatory filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S6	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S7	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S8	We have over 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state s insurance rules and regulations, including on average over 11,000 legislative bills, 1,400 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S9	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S10	For example, in the homeowner s line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages, 248 national endorsements, and 593 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P13_S11	Overall, we provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed or appointed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P14_S8	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 3.0 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.

1442145_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for commercial properties.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S6	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.5 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on more than 6.2 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S7	We have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S8	Each year, our field staff visits over 325,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S9	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S10	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S11	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 47,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S12	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S13	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S14	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P16_S15	We also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with people they lend against.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of our Risk Analysis Framework.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and quantify losses.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Insurance We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers) which helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P20_S3	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P20_S4	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our database contains information on approximately 994 million claims and is the world s largest database of P C claims information used for claims and investigations.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claims, more than 199,000 a day on average, across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	We also provide an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in more than 90 countries.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	We also provide data, analytic and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P26_S5	We provide solutions for every phase of a building s life, including:
1442145_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters, contractors and policyholders.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	To help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 467 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	We revise this information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 21,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys and an analysis of the actual claims experience of our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	We estimate that about 84% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	Utilization of such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S5	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S6	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P29_S7	We also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. since 1950.

1442145_15_ITEM1_P30_S11	Our approach combines computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P30_S12	We run our customers claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse, physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P30_S13	This combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P30_S14	We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians, physicians practices, hospitals, dentists, and pharmacies to locate sources of fraud.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P30_S15	After a suspicious source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations, including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers.

1442145_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	EDM is focused on understanding and documenting business-unit and corporate data assets and data issues; sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise; creating an enterprise data strategy; facilitating research and product development; and promoting cross-enterprise communication.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our Verisk Innovative Analytics, or VIA, team is a corporate center of excellence for analytical methods in applying modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our software development teams build the technology used in many of our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	As part of our product-development process, we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our products and services and the market s needs.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels, which meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	In addition, we use frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and other industry forums to gather information to match the needs of the market with our product development efforts.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our clients and the markets in which they operate.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	We also add to our offerings through an active acquisition program.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	Since 2010, we have acquired twelve businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P39_S6	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and sales support.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we had a sales force of 268 people.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical product sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers, we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Tier One or National Accounts constitutes our largest customers, Tier Two or Strategic Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market carriers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	Tier Three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business and/or be one-state or regional writers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	A Sales Generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	Our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Sales people participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	These agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal, state and local governments.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S8	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S9	Sixth, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P46_S10	Lastly, we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices under agreements between our insurer customers and their provider networks.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our costs for data received from our customers were 1.2% and 1.3% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,258 employees.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and Orem, Utah creating redundancy and back-up capabilities.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S6	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units, located in other states.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S7	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S8	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P48_S9	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S5	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S6	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S7	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S8	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S9	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P51_S10	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we employed 6,170 full-time and 380 part-time employees.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our employees include over 185 actuarial professionals, including 42 Fellows and 30 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 160 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 18 Certified and 22 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and 611 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose , and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S4	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S5	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S6	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P54_S7	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S3	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S4	We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P55_S5	To access these, click on the Financial Information SEC" link found on our Investor Relations homepage.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	The public may read and copy any materials filed by Verisk with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1442145_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in any of our securities.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our securities including our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S7	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Specifically, a portion of Class A common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , approximately 49.1% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S7	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S10	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S11	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance and healthcare services sector.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S13	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S15	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P6_S16	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S12	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S13	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S14	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S15	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S16	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P9_S18	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, customers , employees or other s misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P16_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 18 years.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	However, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S13	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S14	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S15	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S16	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S17	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P17_S18	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S8	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P18_S9	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our ten largest shareholders owned 48.7% of our Class A common stock including 7.4% of our Class A common stock owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,986,583 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding as of February 20, 2015 .
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Under Delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 16 states in the United States, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Nepal, and Singapore.
1442145_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Litigation On May 13, 2013, we were served with a putative class action titled Celeste Shaw v. Interthinx, Inc., Verisk Analytics, Inc. and Jeffrey Moyer.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The plaintiff is a current employee of our former subsidiary Interthinx, Inc. based in Colorado, who filed the class action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of all fraud detection employees who have worked for Interthinx for the last three years nationwide and who were classified as exempt employees.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	The class complaint claims that the fraud detection employees were misclassified as exempt employees and, as a result, were denied certain wages and benefits that would have been received if they were properly classified as non-exempt employees.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	It pleads three causes of action against defendants: (1) Collective Action under section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid overtime (nationwide class); (2) A Fed. R. Civ.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	P. 23 class action under the Colorado Wage Act and Wage Order for unpaid overtime and (3) A Fed. R. Civ.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	P. 23 class action under Colorado Wage Act for unpaid commissions/nondiscretionary bonuses (Colorado class).
1442145_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties that are associated with the various statutes, declaratory and injunctive relief interest, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	On July 2, 2013, we were served with a putative class action titled Shabnam Shelia Dehdashtian v. Interthinx, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	The plaintiff, Shabnam Shelia Dehdashtian, a former mortgage auditor at our former subsidiary Interthinx, Inc. in California, filed the class action on behalf of all persons who have been employed by Interthinx as auditors, mortgage compliance underwriters and mortgage auditors nationwide at any time (i) within 3 years prior to the filing of this action until trial for the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) class and (ii) within 4 years prior to the filing of the initial complaint until trial for the California collective action.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	The class complaint claims that the defendants failed to pay overtime compensation, to provide rest and meal periods, waiting time penalties and to provide accurate wage statements to the plaintiffs as required by federal and California law.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	Code sections 510, 1194 and 1198 and IWC Wage Order No. 4; (3) Failure to pay waiting time penalties in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	Code sections 201-203; (4) Failure to provide itemized wage statements in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	Code section 226 and IWC Order No. 4; (5) Failure to provide and or authorize meal and rest periods in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P4_S3	Code section 226.7 and IWC Order No. 4; (6) Violation of California Business and Professions Code sections 17200 et seq; and (7) a Labor Code Private Attorney General Act (PAGA) Public enforcement claim, Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P4_S4	The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties that are associated with the various statutes, equitable and injunctive relief, interest, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	On October 14, 2013, we received notice of a claim titled Dejan Nagl v. Interthinx Services, Inc. filed in the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S1	The claimant, Dejan Nagl, a former mortgage auditor at our former subsidiary Interthinx, Inc. in California, filed the claim on behalf of himself and all current and former individuals employed in California as auditors by Interthinx, Inc. for violations of the California Labor Code and Wage Order.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S2	The claimant alleges on behalf of himself and other auditors the following causes of action: (1) Failure to provide rest breaks and meal periods in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S3	Code sections 226.7, 514 and 1198; (2) Failure to pay overtime wages in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S4	Code sections 510 and 1194; (3) Failure to provide accurate wage statements in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S5	Code section 226; (4) Failure to timely pay wages in violation of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S6	Code section 204; and (5) Failures to timely pay wages for violations of Cal.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P5_S7	The claim seeks compensatory damages and penalties that are associated with the various statutes, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P6_S0	On March 11, 2014, we sold 100 percent of the stock of Interthinx (see Note 6 Discontinued Operations for additional details).
1442145_15_ITEM3_P6_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, we are responsible for the resolution of these matters.

Skelly and Ellen Burke v. Insurance Services Office, Inc. and the Pension Plan for Insurance Organizations.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P16_S1	The plaintiffs, former employees of our subsidiary Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, bring the action on their own behalf as participants in the Pension Plan for Insurance Organizations and on the behalf of similarly situated participants of the pension plan and ask the court to declare that a certain amendment to the pension plan as of December 31, 2001, which terminated their right to calculate and define the value of their retirement benefit under the pension plan based on their compensation levels as of immediately prior to their retirement , or the Unlawful Amendment, violated the anti-cutback provisions and equitable principles of ERISA.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P16_S2	The First Amended Class Action Complaint, or the Amended Complaint, alleges that (1) the Unlawful Amendment of the pension plan violated Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA as well as the anti-cutback rules of ERISA Section 204(g) and Section 411(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) ISO s failure to provide an ERISA 204(h) notice in a manner calculated to be understood by the average pension plan participant was a violation of Sections 204(h) and 102(a) of ERISA; and (3) the Living Pension Right was a contract right under ERISA common law and that by terminating that right through the Unlawful Amendment ISO violated plaintiffs common law contract rights under ERISA.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P16_S3	The Amended Complaint seeks declaratory, equitable and injunctive relief enjoining the enforcement of the Unlawful Amendment and ordering the pension plan and ISO retroactive to the date of the Unlawful Amendment to recalculate the accrued benefits of all class members, indemnification from ISO to the pension plan for costs and contribution requirements related to voiding the Unlawful Amendment, bonuses to the class representatives, costs and attorney s fees.

1442145_15_ITEM3_P18_S2	Except for us, ISO and the defendant Acord Corporation, which provides standard forms to assist in insurance transactions, most of the other defendants are property and casualty insurance companies that plaintiffs claim conspired to underpay property damage claims.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P18_S3	Plaintiffs claim that we and ISO, along with all of the other defendants, violated state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws as well as state common law.
1442145_15_ITEM3_P18_S4	On September 8, 2014, the Court entered an Order striking the Amended Complaint and granting leave to the plaintiffs to file a new complaint.

1442145_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	We believe the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders for Class A, because a large portion of Class A common stock is held in street name by brokers.

1442145_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	We anticipate that all repurchases under the ASR Program will be completed no later than the final settlement in June 2015, at which time we may be entitled to receive additional common shares or, under certain limited circumstances, be required to deliver shares to the counterparties or, at our election, pay cash to the counterparties.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected historical financial data should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, Item 7.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 are derived from consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014 , we acquired 12 businesses, which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations of our mortgage services business.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	The following table sets forth our statement of operations for the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance for the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	(1) During the second quarter of 2011, we reevaluated the probability of D2Hawkeye and Strategic Analytics achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets for exceptional performance in fiscal year 2011 and reversed the contingent consideration related to these acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, we reevaluated the probability of TierMed achieving the specified predetermined EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed its contingent consideration related to this acquisition.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	(2) On March 11, 2014, we sold our mortgage services business.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P5_S1	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. (3) EBITDA is the financial measure which management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P5_S2	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P5_S3	Because EBITDA is calculated from net income, this presentation includes EBITDA from discontinued operations of our mortgage services business.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P5_S4	In addition, this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues from continuing and discontinued operations.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P6_S0	of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P7_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P7_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P8_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P8_S1	(5) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization on October 6, 2009, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders equity (deficit), as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_15_ITEM6_P8_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we repurchased $675.4 million and $278.9 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks and opportunities associated with those risks.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P C insurance, financial services and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our IPO, Insurance Service Office, Inc., or ISO, formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	On October 6, 2009 in connection with our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by Class B insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning Class B common stock.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 37.2% and 38.7% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Effective December 31, 2012, we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industry-standard insurance programs within our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 62.8% and 61.3% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	In January 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Eagleview Technology Corporation, or EVT, the parent company of Pictometry International Corp., and Eagle View Technologies, Inc. for a net cash purchase price of $650 million, which would have been funded by the Company's operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	EVT is a provider of geo-referenced aerial image capture and visual-centric data analytics and solutions to insurers, contractors, government, and commercial customers in the United States.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	On December 16, 2014, we ended our efforts to acquire EVT following the vote by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to challenge the transaction.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	On March 11, 2014, we sold our mortgage services business, Interthinx, Inc., or Interthinx.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	From 2009 to 2011, the mortgage services business was in both Risk Assessment segment within the insurance services revenue category and Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	In 2012, we reclassified the appraisal mortgage tools from Risk Assessment to our Decision Analytics segment in the financial services revenue category.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Therefore, in 2012 and 2013, the mortgage services business is within Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We use year over year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 3.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , 27.7% and 26.4% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S8	Approximately 89.6% and 88.2% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S9	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P13_S10	Approximately 61.9% and 64.4% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	In this segment, customer bases are within the insurance, healthcare, financial services and specialized markets verticals.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Personnel expenses, which represented 56.8% and 59.7% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S6	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S7	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S8	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S9	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S10	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S11	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S12	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S13	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S14	We serve customers in three primary vertical markets: property/casualty insurance, healthcare, and financial services.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S15	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S16	A significant change in property/casualty insurers profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P15_S17	For insurers, the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Growth in property/casualty insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012 and then receding to 4.3% in 2013 and 3.8% through nine-months 2014.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	In recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	A significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud both in claims and at policy inception could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Trends in the U.S. healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	That market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	The specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform, expansion of insurance coverage, and efforts at cost containment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Payment reform will likely drive the market to value-based reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	The expansion of insurance eligibility will increase Medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	And as the government seeks to control fraud, waste, and abuse, efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P19_S6	Although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace, we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management, quality measurement provider/payer risk sharing and value-based payment management, Medicare Advantage revenue management and compliance, risk adjustment, and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We experience seasonality in our Medicare Advantage business tied to third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, related to CMS deadlines.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	U.S. and global market trends can influence the revenue composition and growth trajectory of our financial services vertical.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Recent focus of global regulators on Basel-III compliance and US regulators on compliance to recently adopted 2009 Dodd-Frank laws on anti-money laundering, stress testing and capital adequacy have led to a significant shift of our data-hosting solution toward the meeting of those specific needs of our bank clients.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We expect that a rising interest rate environment is likely to put a significant margin pressure on our bank clients, and can resultantly impact their marketing budgets for growth.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	However, a strengthening American economy is likely to spur increased lending and could likely offset some of that budgetary risk.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Trends associated with the strengthening U.S. dollar relative to several other international currencies (U.K., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand) is putting a downward pressure on our revenues from bank clients from overseas markets.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Lastly, a longer term shift of advertising spend from TV and radio toward digital media has resulted in a greater opportunity for our partnerships and media effectiveness line of businesses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Description of Acquisitions We acquired seven businesses since January 1, 2012.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	At the end of 2012, this long-term contract (since 1992) with IRMS was expiring and precipitated a change in our business relationship.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	Instead of continuing forward with a new services agreement, we acquired the technology and service assets of IRMS as this will enable us to better manage, enhance and continue to use the solutions as part of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	This acquisition had minimal revenue and operating expense impact for the year ending December 31, 2012, given the timing of the acquisition.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2012, we acquired MediConnect, ALP, and Argus, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	MediConnect was included as a recent acquisition only for the first quarter of 2013; ALP was included as a recent acquisition in the first and second quarters of 2013; Argus was included as a recent acquisition in the first, second and third quarters of 2013 as full quarter comparable revenues did not exist until certain quarters of 2012 due to the timing of the acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	These recent acquisitions were within our Decision Analytics segment and provided an increase of $68.1 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S16	The increase in salaries and benefits of $0.7 million includes an increase of $5.1 million in annual salaries increases, medical costs and commissions, offset by a decrease in our stock option expense of $4.1 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S17	Our stock option expense decreased as a result of lower accelerated vesting of equity awards granted to employees at age 62.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P43_S18	Other decreases include a decrease in pension expense of $0.3 million, primarily due to our pension plan freeze.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	This increase is primarily due to the issuance of our senior notes in September 2012 with an aggregate principal balance of $350.0 million, partially offset by the repayment of $180.0 million of private placement debt during the year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $182.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $14.0 million or 7.7%.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our specialized markets revenue increased $0.3 million or 0.3% as a result of modest increase in our supply chain services, offset by a decrease in weather and climate risk solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues for our Decision Analytics segment was $428.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $334.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $93.7 million or 28.0%.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our revenue by category for the periods presented is set forth below for the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues for our Risk Assessment segment was $194.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $182.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $12.1 million or 6.7%.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $6.2 million, primarily related to our stock option expense.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	Our stock option expense decreased as a result of lower accelerated vesting of equity awards granted to employees at age 62.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P50_S6	There was also a decrease in other general expenses of $0.2 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P50_S7	These decreases were offset by an increase in professional consulting fees of $2.5 million and travel costs of $0.4 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 54.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	In management s opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $43.2 million and $169.7 million, respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees received in advance).
1442145_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , were 8.4% and 9.1%, respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	We estimate our capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately $150.0 million, which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S5	We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S6	We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P59_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we repurchased $675.4 million (exclusive of $100.0 million of unsettled purchase price associated with the ASR Program; see Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K), $278.9 million and $162.6 million, respectively, of our common stock.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	In prior years, we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	In April 2012, we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of $72.0 million, which resulted in a contribution of $78.8 million for the year, of which $28.2 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	As a result of the prefunding, we do not expect to make any contribution in 2015 with respect to our qualified pension plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	Under the postretirement plan, we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S5	We expect to contribute approximately $1.1 million to the postretirement plan in 2015 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P60_S6	We had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $1,425.8 million and $1,265.1 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P61_S8	Interest is payable semi-annually on March 12th and September 12th of each year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P61_S9	The senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by ISO and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility (credit facility), or any amendment, refinancing or replacement thereof.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	including for general corporate purposes, share repurchases, and acquisitions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	On October 21, 2014, we amended our committed senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks to increase the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from $975.0 million to $990.0 million and extend the maturity date from October 2018 to October 2019.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	We amortize all one-time fees and third party costs associated with the execution and amendment of this credit facility through the maturity date.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Interest is payable at a maturity rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending on the result of certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Verisk and ISO are co-borrowers under the credit facility.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we borrowed $225.0 million under the credit facility and repaid $65.0 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had $160.0 million and $0 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P64_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , we have an available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit, of $827.8 million under the credit facility.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	These covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters, we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 3.5 to 1.0.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014.

1442145_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	We were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of December 31, 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $489.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $506.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities was primarily affected by the sale of our mortgage services business and the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $506.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $468.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers, partially offset by an increase in interest payments related to our bond offerings.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	In the second quarter of 2012, we pre-funded $72.0 million to our pension plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	of a temporary federal tax relief program related to Hurricane Sandy.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	This tax payment would have typically been paid in the fourth quarter of 2012, but due to this relief, the payment was made in the first quarter of 2013.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $ 35.5 million and $145.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our mortgage services business for $155.0 million on March 11, 2014, partially offset by the acquisition of Maplecroft of $30.1 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	Net cash used in investing activities was $145.6 million and $883.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the fact that we had acquisitions in 2012 with a combined net cash purchase price of $808.3 million versus minor acquisition activity in 2013 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S4	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $579.1 million and $284.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S5	The increase of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $778.5 million related to the ASR, partially offset by net debt draw downs of $160.0 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S6	Net cash used in financing activities was $284.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and net cash provided by financing was $313.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S7	Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $277.4 million and debt repayments of $190.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefit of $190.3 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P69_S8	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2014 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	(1) Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of our ESOP contributions and employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.6 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $2.8 million.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P70_S5	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S9	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S10	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S11	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S12	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P72_S13	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $1,613.6 million, which represents 68.8% of our total assets.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	During 2014 , we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2014 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $1,207.1 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminates all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2014 , we determined this rate to be 3.99% , a decrease of 0.75% from the 4.74% rate used at December 31, 2013 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P79_S8	Our postretirement rate is 3.00% at December 31, 2014 , a decrease of 0.45% from the 3.45% used at December 31, 2013 .
1442145_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the pension plan assets were allocated 41.30% debt, 56.80% equity securities and 1.90% other.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S4	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S5	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P81_S6	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1442145_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $1.1 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2015, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $47.3 million, which will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2034.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The deferred income tax liability of $197.8 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(t) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $160.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2014 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $1.6 million based on our current borrowing levels.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_15_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P4_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P4_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control ---- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P6_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P7_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby the Company indemnifies another party for breaches of confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property or gross negligence.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Such indemnifications are primarily granted under licensing of computer software.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	Most agreements contain provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications; however, the Company is not able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation, claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Such estimates are based on management s judgment.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S4	The Company completed the required annual impairment test as of June 30, 2014 , which resulted in no impairment of goodwill in 2014 .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S5	This test compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S6	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S7	If the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company will determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P57_S8	If the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of the goodwill.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU No. 2013-11 ).
1442145_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	Under ASU No. 2013-11, an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with the exception that these unrecognized tax benefits are not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	An additional exception applies when the tax law does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, then the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASU No. 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2014.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The adoption of ASU No. 2013-11 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU No. 2014-08 ).

1442145_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU No. 2014-09") .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	The objective of ASU No. 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	In applying the new guidance, an entity will identify the contract(s) with a customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	ASU No. 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements nor decided upon the method of adoption.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	As it is extremely rare in current practice for an event or transaction to be presented as an extraordinary item, this ASU eliminates from the U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	The Company has elected not to early adopt and will assess the impact of this standard when applicable circumstances are warranted.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, available for sale securities and accounts receivable, which are generally not collateralized.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	ASC 820-10 requires disclosures detailing the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company applied the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Level 2 Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	Level 3 Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which is internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The following table provides information for such assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	The fair values of cash and cash equivalents (other than money-market funds which are recorded on a reported net asset value basis disclosed below), accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, fees received in advance, acquisition related liabilities prior to the adoption of ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805 ), short-term debt, and short-term debt expected to be refinanced approximate their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level for cash equivalents and registered investment companies that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1442145_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	(1) Registered investment companies are classified as available-for-sale securities and are valued using quoted prices in active markets multiplied by the number of shares owned.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Company has not elected to carry its long-term debt at fair value.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	The carrying value of the long-term debt represents amortized cost.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	The Company assesses the fair value of its long-term debt based on quoted market prices if available, and if not, an estimate of interest rates available to the Company for debt with similar features, the Company s current credit rating and spreads applicable to the Company.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	For each tax position, the Company must determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize within the financial statements.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	No benefits may be recognized for tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P113_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:

1442145_15_ITEM8_P114_S3	The Company does not expect a significant increase in unrecognized benefits related to federal, foreign, or state tax exposures within the coming year.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P114_S4	In addition, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $1,109 of its currently remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2015 as a result of a combination of audit settlements and lapses of statute of limitations, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in various state and foreign jurisdictions.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	Basic EPS is computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, respectively, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P136_S1	The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding, using the treasury stock method, if the dilutive potential common shares, including stock options, nonvested restricted stock, nonvested restricted stock units, and the impact from the ASR program, had been issued.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P147_S8	The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table during the years ended December 31:
1442145_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	The expected term for a majority of the awards granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	The volatility factor for stock options granted prior to 2014 was based on the average volatility of the Company's peers as the Company did not have a history of stock price sufficient to cover the expected term of those awards.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	The volatility factor for stock options granted in 2014 was based on the volatility of the Company's stock.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P149_S4	The expected dividend yield was based on the Company s expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	A summary of options outstanding under the Incentive Plan and the Option Plan and changes during the three years then ended is presented below:

1442145_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	Intrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of Verisk s common stock as of the reporting date.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2014 was $303,267 and $286,728 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	In accordance with ASC 718, excess tax benefit from exercised stock options is recorded as an increase to additional-paid-in capital and a corresponding reduction in taxes payable.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of options exercised in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P153_S2	The amount of the tax benefit that has been realized, as a result of those excess tax benefits, is presented as a financing cash inflow within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P154_S4	Changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the requisite service period and may impact the timing of expense recognized over the requisite service period.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	Stock based compensation expense for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $20,253 , $21,087 and $24,696 , respectively.

1442145_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	The future benefit payments for the Postretirement Plan are net of the federal Medicare subsidy.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	The healthcare cost trend rate for 2014 was 7.50% gradually decreasing to 5.00% in 2020 .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P170_S2	A 1.00% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:
1442145_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	The expected subsidy from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the Company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3,182 and $2,868 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $10 , $19 and $114 in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P171_S1	The expected return on the Pension Plan assets for 2014 and 2013 was 7.50% , which was determined by taking into consideration the Company s analysis of its actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast after adjusting for the target investment allocation and reflecting the current economic environment.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Company s investment guidelines target investment allocation of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Pension Plan assets consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and equity funds.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P172_S2	Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P172_S3	These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P172_S4	Investment managers are prohibited from entering into any speculative hedging transactions.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	The investment objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P173_S1	The domestic equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 40% and 60% .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P173_S2	The international equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 10% and 20% .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	income portion of the total portfolio should range between 20% and 40% .
1442145_15_ITEM8_P174_S1	The asset allocation at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and target allocation for 2015 by asset category are as follows:
1442145_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the Pension Plan.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P176_S2	The Company believes that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P176_S3	These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Company also maintains a voluntary employees beneficiary association plan (the VEBA Plan ) under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code to fund the Postretirement Plan.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	Today, those businesses form the core of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Over the past two decades, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	To further expand our Decision Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2010, we acquired 3E Company, creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the Company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Verisk common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009 under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P9_S5	We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by Class B insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning Class B common stock.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	We converted all Class B shares to Class A shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding Class B shares.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	On May 26, 2015, we eliminated the separate classes of common stock, and as a result, Verisk Class A and Class B common stock were renamed common stock.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our senior management team, which includes our president and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, and nine senior officers who lead our business and operational units, have been with us for an average of almost 15 years.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	This team has led our transformation to a successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our U.S. P C insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new vertical markets, including healthcare, financial services, and energy and specialized markets.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Within this segment, we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our customers include most of the P C insurance providers in the U.S.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Industry-Standard Insurance Programs We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	To meet their needs, we process and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands approximately 2,800 regulatory filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S6	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S7	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S8	We have over 107 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state s insurance rules and regulations, including on average over 16,000 legislative bills, 1,900 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S9	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S10	For example, in the homeowner s line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages, 261 national endorsements, and 602 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P14_S11	Overall, we provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	We aggregate the data and, as a licensed or appointed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we report these statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S8	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 3.4 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S9	We maintain a database of over 19.0 billion statistical records, including approximately 7.8 billion commercial lines records and approximately 11.2 billion personal lines records.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S10	We collect unit-transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S11	Our proprietary quality process includes over 2,500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S13	Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P C insurance customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S14	We distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our customers needs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S15	In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P15_S16	We also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	These projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for commercial properties.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.6 million commercial buildings in the United States and also holds information on more than 6.4 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	We have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the United States who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	Each year, our field staff visits over 285,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S5	We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S6	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S7	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 47,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S8	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S9	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S10	To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P18_S11	We also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with people they lend against.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses, including predicting loss, selecting and pricing risk, detecting fraud before and after a loss event, and quantifying losses.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The businesses are categorized by the primary vertical end market for their services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	As we develop our models, our ability to provide value to our customers is enhanced by our solutions, which are constantly recalibrated by refreshed data of actual events.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers) which helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P20_S5	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings and roofs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 468 separate economic areas in North America.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains more than 21,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys and an analysis of the actual claims experience of our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	We estimate that about 80% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S4	Utilization of such a large percentage of the industry s claims leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S5	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P30_S6	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P35_S20	We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P35_S23	Our actuarial services and industry-standard insurance programs are used by the majority of insurers and reinsurers in the U.S.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Decision Analytics Customers In the Decision Analytics segment, we provide our P C insurance solutions to the majority of the P C insurers in the U.S.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P36_S6	Our Competitors We believe no single competitor currently offers the same scope of services and market coverage we provide.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P36_S7	The breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P36_S8	Businesses that we acquire may introduce us to additional competitors.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Risk Assessment Competitors Our Risk Assessment segment operates primarily in the U.S. P C insurance industry, where we enjoy a leading market presence.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	We have a number of competitors in specific lines or services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We encounter competition from a number of sources, including insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Competitors also include other statistical agents, including the National Independent Statistical Service, the Independent Statistical Service and other advisory organizations, providing underwriting rules, prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the American Association of Insurance Services and Mutual Services Organization, although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys, including Overland Solutions, Inc. and Regional Reporting, Inc.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S5	Our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors, management and strategy consulting firms including Deloitte Consulting LLP, and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including Pinnacle Consulting and EMB, a unit of Towers Watson.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P38_S7	We believe that our P C insurance industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against these competitors with more limited offerings.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	In the healthcare market, certain products are offered by a number of companies, including ViPS, Inc., OptumInsight, McKesson, Truven Health Analytics, Inovalon, and iHealth (healthcare predictive modeling and business intelligence).
1442145_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Competitive factors include application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and price.

1442145_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Development of New Solutions We take a market-focused team approach to developing our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our operating units are responsible for developing, reviewing and enhancing our various products and services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our data management and production team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production and quality control.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	Our Joint Development Environment, or JDE, and Enterprise Data Management, or EDM, teams support our efforts to create new information and products from available data and explores new methods of collecting data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	EDM is focused on understanding and documenting business-unit and corporate data assets and data issues; sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise; creating an enterprise data strategy; facilitating research and product development; and promoting cross-enterprise communication.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our Verisk Innovative Analytics, or VIA, team is a corporate center of excellence for analytical methods in applying modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our software development teams build the technology used in many of our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	As part of our product-development process, we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our products and services and the market s needs.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	We have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels, which meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	In addition, we use frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and other industry forums to gather information to match the needs of the market with our product development efforts.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S5	We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our clients and the markets in which they operate.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S6	We also add to our offerings through an active acquisition program.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S7	Since 2011, we have acquired twelve businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S8	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P42_S9	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	We sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and sales support.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had a sales force of 325 people.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical product sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers, we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Tier One or National Accounts constitutes our largest customers, Tier Two or Strategic Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market carriers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Tier Three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business and/or be one-state or regional writers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	A Sales Generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	Our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Sales people participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	These agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary de-identification of data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	These agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	Again, these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal, state and local governments.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S8	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S9	Sixth, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P49_S10	Lastly, we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices under agreements between our insurer customers and their provider networks.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our costs for data received from our customers were 1.0% and 1.2% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,631 employees.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	We support and implement a mix of technologies, focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	We have two primary data centers in Somerset, New Jersey and Lehi, Utah creating redundancy and back-up capabilities.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S6	In addition, we have data centers dedicated to certain business units located in other states.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S7	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P51_S8	All of our critical databases, systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our primary data center recovery site is in New York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security; logical security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls; logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	All laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a third-party storage facility is also encrypted.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	This commitment has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	We also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our products.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware Sketch product.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S7	We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S8	In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S9	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P55_S10	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 7,647 full-time and 271 part-time employees.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our employees include over 170 actuarial professionals, including 35 Fellows and 24 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 139 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 17 Certified and 15 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and 592 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose , and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	In certain instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules and policy language.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.

1442145_16_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 44% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S10	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S11	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance and healthcare services sector.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S13	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S15	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P6_S16	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S12	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S13	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S14	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S15	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S16	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P9_S18	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, customers , employees or other s misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P16_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 15 years.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S9	However, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S10	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S11	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S13	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S14	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S15	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S16	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S17	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P17_S18	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	The United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , our ten largest shareholders owned 38.3% of our common stock including 5.7% of our common stock owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 9,057,243 shares of common stock were outstanding as of February 19, 2016 .
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Under Delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	On May 19, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie (the Acquisition ).
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In order to finance the Acquisition, we incurred $2,180.0 million of indebtedness.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $3,168.0 million , and our leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA) increased from 1.57x at March 31, 2015 to 2.89x.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our increased leverage resulting from the Acquisition could adversely affect our business.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We may fail to realize all the expected benefits of the Acquisition or successfully integrate Wood Mackenzie s operations or preserve its customers and employees in an efficient or timely manner.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	This integration effort may also distract our management s focus from our existing core businesses or impair our existing relationships with employees, customers and our strategic partners.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the Acquisition or could incur higher transition costs.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process or an inability to integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	General economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by Wood Mackenzie s customers for its products and services.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Demand for Wood Mackenzie s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of Wood Mackenzie s customers.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources and other matters.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	A downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by Wood Mackenzie s customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Wood Mackenzie is based in the United Kingdom and conducts its principal operations outside the United States.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the United States has increased materially.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The revenues and costs of Wood Mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result of the Acquisition, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when remeasured in U.S. dollars, may differ materially from expectations.
1442145_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.
1442145_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 16 states in the United States, and offices outside the United States to support our international operations in Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
1442145_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Litigation On September 9, 2015, we were served with a nationwide putative class action complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County in Ohio naming the Company s subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc.

Section 1681p without first obtaining from the user of the report a certification that such user had complied with the obligations under Section 1681b(b)(2) as to the subject of the consumer report.
1442145_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The class complaint alleges that Intellicorp violated the FCRA section 1681b(b)(1) by failing to obtain the required specific certification from its customers to whom Intellicorp furnished consumer reports as to each consumer report provided before providing the specific consumer report that was the subject of the certification.

1442145_16_ITEM6_P5_S1	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P5_S2	Because EBITDA is calculated from net income, this presentation includes EBITDA from discontinued operations of our mortgage services business.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P5_S3	In addition, this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues from continuing and discontinued operations.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P5_S4	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P6_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P6_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P7_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P7_S1	(5) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization on October 6, 2009, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders equity (deficit), as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_16_ITEM6_P7_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we repurchased $120.5 million and $675.4 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks and opportunities associated with those risks.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	We offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, natural resources intelligence, economic forecasting, and many other fields.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P2_S8	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately 33.3% and 37.2% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our Decision Analytics segment provides solutions to our customer in insurance, financial services, healthcare, and energy and specialized markets.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 66.7% and 62.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	On March 11, 2014, we sold our mortgage services business, Interthinx, Inc., or Interthinx.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We use year over year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 3 within Item 6.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , 25.3% and 27.7% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	We earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S7	In general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S8	Approximately 90.1% and 89.6% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S9	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the United States.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P10_S10	Approximately 67.0% and 61.9% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	In this segment, customer bases are within the insurance, financial services, energy and specialized markets, and healthcare verticals.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Personnel expenses, which represented 57.1% and 56.8% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S6	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P12_S7	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	We serve customers in four primary vertical markets: property/casualty insurance, healthcare, energy, and financial services.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S7	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S8	A significant change in property/casualty insurers profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P13_S9	For insurers, the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Growth in property/casualty insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013, and 4.4% in 2014.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	In recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	A significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud both in claims and at policy inception could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Most notable among the recent trends affecting the vertical includes a significant increase in the number of alternative lenders and alternative payment instruments in the market.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	We are adapting our offerings to address the needs of alternative lenders, backed by our deep expertise in and datasets covering the performance of customers across a full range of credit histories.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	As well, our unique ability to analyze the customer adoption rates of new alternative payment instruments from our syndicated study datasets is enabling us to serve as the go to solution for the industry s analytic needs in the space.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of our international clients and a softening of the global economy is putting an even greater level of downward pressure on our revenues from such clients.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S5	However, we are also observing a growing appetite for our expense and regulatory focused solutions among those clients.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S6	Lastly, we are seeing a greater number of companies entering the ad effectiveness space, potential competitors to our position in this space.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P17_S7	We stand confident of our position at this stage, given the unique nature and strength of our partnerships coupled by the comprehensiveness of our data, particularly as it relates to seeing the full wallet spend of a consumer.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Trends in the energy, metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Movements of commodity prices affect the profitability of energy and metals and mining companies, while stock markets and mergers and acquisitions, or M A, are the principal drivers of activity for financial institutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Among the specific trends influencing commodity prices are global gross domestic product growth, supply of individual commodities, and geopolitical factors.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The slow down of the Chinese economy is currently contributing to an oversupply of a number of commodities.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Rising U.S. oil and gas production, OPEC policy, and the partial lifting of sanctions against Iran in January 2016 has led to a sharp fall in crude oil prices; and most metals markets are currently in oversupply.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Lower commodity prices have reduced discretionary spending for clients and has stalled M A activity.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	However, the uncertainty also increases client demand for our data and services.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Commodity prices are expected to recover over time to incentivize the investment required to meet growing energy demand.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Longer term the Paris global accord on climate change signals a period of change in the energy mix, incentivizing growth in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies, while fossil fuels are expected to remain a core part of energy demand for the foreseeable future.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	We will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our clients in an increasingly complex market.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Trends in the U.S. healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the Decision Analytics segment.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	That market continues to undergo significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	The specific trends affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform, expansion of insurance coverage, and efforts at cost containment.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Payment reform is driving the market to value-based reimbursement, which has caused healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	increased enrollment in Medicaid and in the commercial market through statewide health exchanges.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	As the government seeks to control fraud, waste, and abuse, efforts to contain costs will likely continue to become more prevalent.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace, we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population health management, quality measurement, risk adjustment for Medicare Advantage and Qualified Health Plans participating on statewide health exchanges, and detection of prepayment fraud, waste and abuse.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We experience seasonality in our Medicare Advantage risk adjustment business in the second half of our fiscal year, related to the CMS submission deadline.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Description of Acquisitions We acquired six businesses since January 1, 2013.

1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $101.7 million or 5.8% .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	Revenue growth within Decision Analytics was primarily driven by our insurance and financial services categories.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	Both categories, industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific rating and underwriting information, within Risk Assessment contributed to its revenue growth.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S6	Refer to the Results of Continuing Operations by Segment within this section for further information regarding our revenues.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S7	Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues was $803.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $716.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $86.7 million or 12.1% .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S8	Our recent acquisitions within the Decision Analytics segment accounted for an increase of $82.4 million in cost of revenues, of which $6.0 million were non-recurring equity compensation associated with the Wood Mackenzie acquisition and the remaining amount was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S9	Excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $4.3 million or 0.6%.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P37_S10	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $18.7 million.

1442145_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $141.9 million and $43.2 million, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues).
1442145_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , were 8.0% and 8.4%, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	We estimate our capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $175 million, which primarily consists of expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S6	We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P62_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we repurchased $20.5 million, $778.5 million and $277.4 million, respectively, of our common stock.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	In prior years, we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	In April 2012, we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of $72.0 million, which resulted in a contribution of $78.8 million for the year, of which $28.2 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	As a result of the prefunding, we do not expect to make any contribution in 2016 with respect to our qualified pension plan.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	Under the postretirement plan, we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	We expect to contribute approximately $1.0 million to the postretirement plan in 2016 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S6	We had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations and the discounts on our senior notes, of $3,170.0 million and $1,430.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S7	The debt at December 31, 2015 was primarily issued under senior notes in May 2015, during 2012 and 2011 and borrowings outstanding under the new Credit Facility described below.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S8	On May 15, 2015, we completed issuances of senior notes in aggregate principal amounts of $900.0 million and $350.0 million due on June 15, 2025 and June 15, 2045, respectively, that accrue interest at a rate of 4.000% and 5.500%, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S9	Interest is payable semi-annually on both series of senior notes on June 15th and December 15th of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S10	The senior notes were issued at a discount of $4.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and we incurred debt issuance costs on the senior notes of $7.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S11	The discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "Long-term debt" and "Other assets," respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and these costs will be amortized to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K over the life of the respective senior note.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P63_S12	The net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were utilized to partially fund the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,300.0 million outstanding, and we were in compliance with our debt covenants.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	BNP Paribas, TD Bank, N.A., The Northern Trust Company, and Capital One N.A.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	The new Credit Facility became effective on May 15, 2015, and we utilized borrowings of $930.0 million from the new Credit Facility to partially fund the purchase of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	The new Credit Facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions and the share repurchase program, or Repurchase Program.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The new Credit Facility has replaced the previously existing $990.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility, or old Credit Facility.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	On July 24, 2015, we entered into the First Amendment to the new Credit Facility which modified the definitions of Consolidated EBIT and Consolidated EBITDA to permit the adding back of certain non-recurring expenses related to the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The new Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	These covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that we maintain, during any period of four fiscal quarters, a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.0, which ratio steps down to 3.5 to 1.0 at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter ending after the consummation of the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the new Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we had total combined borrowings under the old Credit Facility and new Credit Facility of $1,155.0 million and repaid $445.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	Interest on borrowings under the new Credit Facility is payable at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending upon the consolidated funded debt leverage ratio.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P67_S6	A commitment fee on any unused balance is payable periodically and may range from 12.5 to 25.0 basis points based upon the consolidated funded debt leverage ratio.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings under the new Credit Facility and old Credit Facility of $870.0 million and $160.0 million, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	All borrowings under the new Credit Facility are and shall continue to remain unsecured.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 under the new Credit Facility contains maturity dates in 2016.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Throughout 2016, we plan to repay a portion of this debt through cash from operations and to refinance the remainder through our new Credit Facility.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	In January and February 2016, we utilized cash from operations to repay a total of $165.0 million of the $870.0 million outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015 under the new Credit Facility.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we no longer have any outstanding private placement debt.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	On April 29, 2015, we repaid $85.0 million and $50.0 million of private placement debt with Prudential Capital Group and New York Life, respectively, that came due utilizing $55.0 million from cash on hand and $80.0 million from borrowings under the Credit Facility.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, on May 14, 2015, we prepaid the remaining private placement debt with New York Life of $17.5 million, which had been due on October 26, 2015, and $17.5 million and $50.0 million of remaining private placement debt with Prudential, which had been due on October 26, 2015 and June 15, 2016, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	To prepay this debt, we utilized $25.0 million of cash on hand and borrowings from our old Credit Facility of $60.0 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P69_S4	The contractual costs for the prepayment of this debt was $4.8 million and was recorded to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	On March 10, 2015, in connection with our agreement to acquire Wood Mackenzie, we entered into a commitment letter for a $2,300.0 million 364-day bridge financing arrangement with Bank of America N.A. and Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. acting as joint lead arrangers.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	This financing arrangement was only to be utilized in the event we did not carry out the debt and equity offerings relating to its acquisition of Wood Mackenzie by a certain date, and was terminated upon the closing of the acquisition.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K. We paid fees associated with this financing arrangement of $9.1 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	Due to the completion of the debt and equity offerings, this arrangement was terminated and the full $9.1 million of fees were recorded to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P70_S4	The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $623.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $489.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by an increase in revenues and operating profit and additional operating cash flow from Wood Mackenzie, partially offset by acquisition fees related to the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie and interest payments on our senior notes that were issued in May 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $489.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $506.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities was primarily affected by the sale of our mortgage services business and the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $ 3,006.3 million and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S5	The change in investing activities was primarily due to the cash used for the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie of $2,889.6 million on May 19, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S6	Net cash used in investing activities was $35.5 million and $145.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S7	The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our mortgage services business for $155.0 million on March 11, 2014, partially offset by the acquisition of Maplecroft of $30.1 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S8	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,481.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and net cash used in financing activities was $579.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S9	Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the net proceeds from the debt and equity offerings of $1,244.0 million and $720.8 million, respectively, and other borrowings from our old and new Credit Facilities, partially offset by repurchases of common stock $20.5 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S10	Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to the repurchase of common stock of $778.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and other stock option related items of $47.2 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S11	Net cash used in financing activities was $579.1 million and $284.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S12	The increase of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $778.5 million related to the ASR, partially offset by net debt draw downs of $160.0 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P71_S13	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2015 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	(1) Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of our ESOP contributions and employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $14.5 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $2.8 million.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S5	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S6	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P73_S7	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S4	The Company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S9	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S10	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S11	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S12	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P74_S13	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P75_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $4,511.6 million, which represents 80.3% of our total assets.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	During 2015 , we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2015 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	As part of this regular process, the Company conducted the annual impairment test of our newly acquired energy reporting unit at June 30, 2015, at which time the fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 5%.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	This outcome is consistent with the Company s expectation due to the proximity of the impairment test date of June 30 to the acquisition date of May 19, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S4	Our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $3,134.8 million as of December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S6	There was a significant estimate this year related to the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S7	The preliminarily estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the purchase of Wood Mackenzie have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on known facts that existed on the date of acquisition.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P80_S8	The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	We determined the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities of Wood Mackenzie with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	These estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) and may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further information.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	On February 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminates all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2015 , we determined this rate to be 4.73% , an increase of 0.74% from the 3.99% rate used at December 31, 2014 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P83_S8	Our postretirement rate is 3.25% at December 31, 2015 , an increase of 0.25% from the 3.00% used at December 31, 2014 .
1442145_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the pension plan assets were allocated 39.60% debt, 60.00% equity securities and 0.40% other.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1442145_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.5 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2016, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $56.6 million, which will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The net deferred income tax liability of $396.4 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(s) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2015 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $870.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2015 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $8.7 million based on our current borrowing levels.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A portion of our revenue is denominated in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against British pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If British pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in U.S. dollars will increase.
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	A hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2015 .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Wood Mackenzie Limited ("Wood Mackenzie"), which was acquired on May 19, 2015, Infield Systems Limited ("Infield"), which was acquired on November 6, 2015, and The PCI Group ("PCI"), which was acquired on November 20, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	The excluded financial statements of the acquisitions constitute approximately 4.9% of total assets and 10.2% of total revenues collectively included within our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for Wood Mackenzie, Infield and PCI.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_16_ITEM8_P4_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P5_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P5_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P5_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Wood Mackenzie Limited, which was acquired on May 19, 2015, Infield Systems Limited, which was acquired on November 6, 2015, and The PCI Group, which was acquired on November 20, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S2	The financial statements of these acquisitions constitute 4.9% of total assets and 10.2% of revenues collectively of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S3	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at WoodMackenzie Limited, Infield Systems Limited or The PCI Group.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S4	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S5	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P7_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P8_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Verisk trades under the ticker symbol VRSK on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
1442145_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Significant estimates include acquisition purchase price allocations, the fair value of goodwill, the realization of deferred tax assets, acquisition related liabilities, fair value of stock based compensation, assets and liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits, and the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company's mortgage services business qualified as assets held-for-sale.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	The mortgage services business was sold on March 11, 2014.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The following describes the Company s primary types of revenues and the applicable revenue recognition policies.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to customers.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales tax withholdings.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Industry-Standard Insurance Programs Industry-standard insurance programs, statistical agent and data services and actuarial services are sold to participating insurance company customers under annual agreements covering a calendar year where the price is determined at the inception of the agreement.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the term of these annual agreements, as services are performed and continuous access to information is provided over the entire term of the agreements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company provides property-specific rating information through reports issued for specific commercial properties, for which revenue is recognized when the report is delivered to the customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	In addition, the Company provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information about the properties being insured and underwriting information in the form of standard policy forms to be used by customers.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	As the customer has a contractual right to take possession of the software without significant penalty, revenues from these arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract period from the time when the customer had access to the solution in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition ( ASC 985-605 ).
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company recognizes software license revenue when the arrangement does not require significant production, customization or modification of the software and the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable, and collections are probable.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S4	These software arrangements include post-contract customer support ( PCS ).
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S5	The Company recognizes software license revenue ratably over the duration of the annual license term as vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of PCS, the only remaining undelivered element, cannot be established in accordance with ASC 985-605.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P24_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Insurance Insurance services primarily consist of term-based software licenses.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	These software arrangements include PCS, which includes unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company recognizes software license revenue ratably over the duration of the annual license term as VSOE of PCS, the only remaining undelivered element, cannot be established in accordance with ASC 985-605.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S3	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S4	In certain instances, the customers are billed for access on a monthly basis for the term-based software licenses and the Company recognizes revenue accordingly.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P25_S5	There are also services within insurance, which are comprised of transaction-based fees recognized as information is delivered to customers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Financial Services Financial services include various types of services to customers.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company primarily recognizes revenue ratably for these services over the term of the agreements, as services are performed and continuous service is provided over the entire term of the agreements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	In addition, there are certain services which are comprised of transaction-based fees; in these instances, revenue is recognized as information is delivered to customers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Healthcare The Company provides software hosting arrangements to customers whereby the customer does not have the right to take possession of the software.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	As these arrangements include PCS throughout the hosting term, revenues from these multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ).

1442145_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	The tax effects of significant items comprising the Company s deferred tax assets as of December 31 are as follows:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	During November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	The Company early adopted ASU No. 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	The net deferred income liability of $396,430 consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The Company has provided for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating losses of certain subsidiaries.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	The Company has determined that the generation of future taxable income from certain subsidiaries to fully realize the deferred tax assets is uncertain.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	Other than these items, the Company has determined, based on the Company s historical operating performance, that taxable income of the Company will more likely than not be sufficient to fully realize the deferred tax assets.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	It is the practice of the Company to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in those operations.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P110_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholdings taxes on approximately $102,837 of the unremitted earnings.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P110_S6	Consequently, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes or associated withholding taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company follows ASC No. 740-10, which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	For each tax position, the Company must determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize within the financial statements.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P111_S3	No benefits may be recognized for tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P111_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , $11,444 , $5,771 and $4,658 , respectively, represent the amounts that, if recognized, would have a favorable effect on the Company s effective tax rate in any future periods.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $2,815 , $2,818 and $2,619 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of Provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P112_S3	The Company does not expect a significant increase in unrecognized benefits related to federal, foreign, or state tax exposures within the coming year.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P112_S4	In addition, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $472 of its currently remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2016 as a result of a combination of audit settlements and lapses of statute of limitations, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in various state and foreign jurisdictions.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company joined by its domestic subsidiaries, files a consolidated income tax return for the Federal income tax purposes.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S2	The volatility factor for stock options granted prior to 2014 was based on the average volatility of the Company's peers as the Company did not have a history of stock price sufficient to cover the expected term of those awards.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S3	The volatility factor for stock options granted in 2014 and 2015 was based on the volatility of the Company's stock.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S4	The expected dividend yield was based on the Company s expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P143_S5	A summary of options outstanding under the Incentive Plan and the Option Plan and changes during the three years then ended is presented below:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	A summary of the status of the Company s nonvested options and changes is presented below:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Intrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of Verisk s common stock as of the reporting date.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P145_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015 was $334,691 and $307,924 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	In accordance with ASC 718, excess tax benefit from exercised stock options is recorded as an increase to additional-paid-in capital and a corresponding reduction in taxes payable.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of options exercised in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	The amount of the tax benefit that has been realized, as a result of those excess tax benefits, is presented as a financing cash inflow within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S5	The Company estimates expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense only for those awards that the Company expects to vest.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S6	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P146_S7	Changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the requisite service period and may impact the timing of expense recognized over the requisite service period.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Stock based compensation expense for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $30,542 , $20,253 and $21,087 , respectively.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	The Company applied a cash balance formula to determine future benefits.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S2	Under the cash balance formula, each participant has an account, which is credited annually based on salary rates determined by years of service, as well as the interest earned on the previous year-end cash balance.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S3	The Company also has a non-qualified supplemental cash balance plan ( SERP ) for certain employees.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S4	The SERP is funded from the general assets of the Company.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S5	Effective February 29, 2012, the Company instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the Pension Plan and SERP.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P153_S6	In 2015 , the Pension Plan and the SERP had a plan amendment due to the adoption of the updated mortality table.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Pension Plan s funding policy is to contribute annually at an amount between the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P154_S1	In April 2012, the Company completed a voluntary prefunding to the Pension Plan of $72,000 .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	prefunding, the minimum contribution requirement was and is expected to be $0 in 2015 and 2016 , respectively.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	The estimated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive losses that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost during 2016 are summarized below:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are provided below:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	The following table presents the estimated future benefit payments for the respective plans.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P160_S1	The future benefit payments for the Postretirement Plan are net of the federal Medicare subsidy.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	The healthcare cost trend rate for 2015 was 8.50% gradually decreasing to 5.00% in 2023.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	A 1.00% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	The expected subsidy from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the Company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2,453 and $3,182 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $7 , $10 and $19 in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	The expected return on the Pension Plan assets for 2015 and 2014 was 7.50% , which was determined by taking into consideration the Company s analysis of its actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast after adjusting for the target investment allocation and reflecting the current economic environment.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	The Company s investment guidelines target investment allocation of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Pension Plan assets consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and equity funds.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P163_S2	Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P163_S3	These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P163_S4	Investment managers are prohibited from entering into any speculative hedging transactions.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	The investment objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	The domestic equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 40% and 60% .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P164_S2	The international equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 10% and 20% .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P164_S3	The fixed income portion of the total portfolio should range between 20% and 40% .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P164_S4	The asset allocation at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and target allocation for 2016 by asset category are as follows:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the Pension Plan.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P166_S2	The Company believes that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P166_S3	These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company also maintains a voluntary employees beneficiary association plan (the VEBA Plan ) under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code to fund the Postretirement Plan.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P167_S1	The asset allocation for the VEBA Plan at December 31, 2015 and target allocation for 2016 are 100% in debt securities.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company reclassified $142,117 of Pension Plan assets from Level 2 to Level 1.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P168_S1	These assets, primarily consist of mutual funds used to be in the pooled separate accounts, were reinvested in a managed equity account.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	For assets that were transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year, fair values are ascribed as if the assets had been transferred as of the beginning of the year.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	There were no transfers among Levels 1, 2 or 3 for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1442145_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	Fair Value Measurements for further discussion with respect to fair value hierarchy.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	The following table summarizes the fair value measurements by level of the Pension Plan and Postretirement Plan assets:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	(1) Valued at the closing price of shares for domestic stocks within the managed equity accounts, and valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) of shares for mutual funds at either the closing price reported in the active market or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings for corporate bonds held by the Pension Plan in these managed accounts.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P171_S1	(2) The pooled separate accounts invest in domestic and foreign stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P171_S2	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the pooled separate account, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	(3) Investments for which readily determinable prices do not exist are valued by the General Partner using either the market or income approach.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	In establishing the estimated fair value of investments, including those without readily determinable values, the General Partner assumes a reasonable period of time for liquidation of the investment, and takes into consideration the financial condition and operating results of the underlying portfolio company, nature of investment, restrictions on marketability, holding period, market conditions, foreign currency exposures, and other factors the General Partner deems appropriate.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	(4) The fund invested in the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities or securities that are rated AAA by S P, AAA by Fitch, or Aaa by Moody s, including but not limited to mortgage securities such as agency and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and other obligations that are secured by mortgages or mortgage backed securities, and valued at the closing price reported in the active market.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	Segment Reporting ASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( ASC 280-10 ), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P176_S3	The Company s President and CEO is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280-10.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Company develops solutions that its customers use to analyze key processes in managing risk.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company s combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary data to generate solutions.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P177_S2	In most cases, the Company s customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company also develops solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P178_S2	Fraud solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance and healthcare sectors.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P178_S3	The Company further leverages predictive models and proprietary data to advise customers to make asset investment and portfolio allocation decisions in the global energy market.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	On March 11, 2014, the Company sold the Company's mortgage services business, Interthinx.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	Results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented.

1442145_16_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Company s databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P180_S2	The Company uses this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments for which separate discrete financial information is available and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S1	The Company uses EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S2	EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S3	Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S4	Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P181_S5	The Company does not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets or geographical locations.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P182_S1	On a geographic basis, no individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10.0% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

1442145_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	Commitments and Contingencies: The Company s operations are conducted on leased premises.
1442145_16_ITEM8_P186_S1	Approximate minimum rentals under long-term noncancelable leases for all leased premises, computer equipment and automobiles are as follows:
1442145_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	Most of the leases require payment of property taxes and utilities and, in certain cases, contain renewal options.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P0_S12	Our existing businesses, in addition to new product innovations, integrate the following four singular qualities into the foundation of our strategy.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P0_S13	Our Distinctives Unique Data Assets - Data is at the core of what we do.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P0_S14	We use our proprietary data assets to develop predictive analytics and transformative models for our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Deep Domain Expertise - We have specialized and in-depth knowledge in a number of defined vertical markets, including insurance, healthcare, energy, financial services, and risk management.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	We understand that different verticals require different approaches, and our deep domain expertise adds value to our analytics in the markets we serve.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Steady Stream of First-to-Market Innovations - We move quickly to be the first to market with new solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Typically, the marketplace assumes that those that are first to market are superior to the competition and better positioned to succeed.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Deep Integration into Customer Workflows - By embedding our solutions into customer workflows, we help our customers better manage risk and optimize their bottom line.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	We achieve this goal by remaining closely connected to our customers at all times and serving their distinct needs.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid and represented over 80% of our revenues in 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , we had revenues of $1,995.2 million and net income of $591.2 million .
1442145_17_ITEM1_P3_S4	For the five year period ended December 31, 2016 , our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 13.9% and 15.8%, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our History We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc., or ISO, started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services to the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	Over the past two decades, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	To further expand our business, in 2002, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2006, to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of estimation software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2012, we acquired Argus Information Advisory Services, LLC, or Argus, to expand our global presence providing information, competitive benchmarking, analytics, and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2015, we acquired Wood Mackenzie Limited, or Wood Mackenzie, to advance our strategy to expand internationally and position us in the global energy market.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S4	Those acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to support our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P6_S5	They have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and selectively around the world.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISO.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the Company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	Verisk common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009, under the symbol VRSK.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Risk Assessment Segment Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P C insurance customers and focuses on prediction of loss, selection and pricing of risk, and compliance with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our customers include most of the P C insurance providers in the U.S.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	In recent years we have expanded our offerings to also serve certain non-U.S. markets.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Industry-Standard Insurance Programs We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P C insurers define coverages and issue policies.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules, and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our policy language, prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	To meet their needs, we process approximately 2,400 regulatory filings and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands each year to ensure smooth implementation of our rules and forms.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators ensure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S6	Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they offer.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S7	With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S8	We have more than 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state s insurance rules and regulations, including an average of more than 16,500 legislative bills, 6,100 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S9	To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P11_S10	For example, in the homeowners line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages, 289 national endorsements, and 601 state-specific endorsements.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	The P C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. P C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our statistical agent services have enabled P C insurers to meet those regulatory requirements for more than 45 years.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We aggregate the data, and as a licensed or appointed statistical agent in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we report those statistics to insurance regulators.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	To provide our customers and the regulators the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	Over the past four decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our Risk Assessment segment.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S7	We supplement this data with publicly available information.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S8	Each year, P C insurers send us approximately 3.5 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S9	We maintain a database of more than 20.0 billion statistical records, including approximately 8.2 billion commercial lines records and approximately 11.8 billion personal lines records.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S10	We collect unit transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P12_S11	Our proprietary quality process includes more than 2,800 separate checks to ensure that the data meets our high standards of quality.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We provide actuarial services to help our customers analyze and price their risks.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P C insurance customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	We distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our customers needs.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our customers that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	We also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We project customers' future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Those projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used their own data exclusively.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	By building on our insurance industry expertise and recent acquisitions, we have expanded our solution set to serve customers in certain non-U.S. markets.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	We gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance, as well as business owners, or BOP, commercial auto and general liability insurance, and workers compensation coverages.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	Our property-specific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss to commercial properties.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S7	Our ProMetrix operating platform contains business and risk information on 26 million entities, loss costs and other vital information on more than 3.7 million commercial buildings in the U.S. and also holds information on more than 6.5 million individual businesses occupying those buildings.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S8	We have a staff of approximately 600 field representatives strategically located around the U.S. who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P15_S9	Each year, our field staff visits over 285,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We also provide proprietary analytic measures for individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection services for approximately 46,000 fire response jurisdictions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	We also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	Further, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	We also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with properties they lend against.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We have begun to expand our footprint of data and solutions to include both U.S. and international markets.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses, including predicting loss, selecting and pricing risk, detecting fraud before and after a loss event, and quantifying losses.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our businesses in this segment are categorized by the primary vertical end market for their services.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our solutions are built on unique data sets which are dynamic and updated based on new data and events.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our analytic methods and proprietary data sets combined with our deep industry expertise, provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Insurance Our insurance solutions provide our customers analytics in the areas of fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, loss estimation, and underwriting, including emerging areas of interest within these categories.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Our anti-fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers), that helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	The system searches for matches in identifying informational fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P19_S7	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award, or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals, and possible fraud rings.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our database contains information on approximately 1.1 billion claims and is the world s largest database of P C claims information used for claims and investigations.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claims more than 200,000 a day on average across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We also provide an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims, and products that use link analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	We are also a leader in and pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our models of global natural hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	We have developed models, covering natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and floods, for potential loss events in more than 100 countries, as well as pandemics worldwide.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	We have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S6	Our newest model also addresses cyber losses.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S7	We also provide data, analytics and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P23_S8	We provide solutions for every phase of a building s life, including:

1442145_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	To help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters in estimating repairs using a patented plan-sketching program.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings, and roofs.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 468 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	We revise this information monthly, and, in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains approximately 21,000 unit-cost line items.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P29_S31	We will continue to expand our data and analytics capabilities across industries.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P29_S32	While we expect this will occur primarily through organic growth, we have and will continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P29_S33	We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P31_S6	The breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P31_S7	Businesses that we acquire may introduce us to additional competitors.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Risk Assessment Competitors Our Risk Assessment segment operates primarily in the U.S. P C insurance industry, where we enjoy a leading market presence.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	We have a number of competitors in specific lines or services.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P32_S6	We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P32_S7	In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P32_S8	Our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors, management and strategy consulting firms, such as Deloitte Consulting LLP, and smaller specialized information technology and analytical services firms, including Pinnacle Consulting and EMB, a unit of Willis Towers Watson.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	We believe that our P C insurance industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers are competitive strengths.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	We have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels, that meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S5	We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our customers and the markets in which they operate.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S6	We add to our offerings through an active acquisition program.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S7	Since 2012, we have acquired 15 businesses, which have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S8	When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P37_S9	This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	We sell our solutions and services primarily through direct interaction with our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	We employ a three-tier sales structure that includes salespeople, technical consultants and sales support.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Within the company, several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Those specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical solution sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	To provide account management to our largest customers in the insurance, financial and energy markets, we segment our customers into three groups.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Tier One or Global/National Accounts, is comprised of our largest customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Tier Two, or Strategic Accounts, represent both large and middle-market customer groups.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Tier Three is comprised of small and specialized companies that may represent one line of business or may be regionally focused.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	In Tier One and Tier Two segments, we have sales teams organized by the following specialities: Rating, Underwriting, Claims, Catastrophe Risk, and Energy.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	In the Tier Three segment, we assign a sales generalist with overall account management responsibility.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	Our tiered approach has proven to be a successful sales model and approach to building customer relationships.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	Our senior executives regularly engage with the senior management of our customers to ensure customer satisfaction and strategic alignment and to support mutual innovation partnership opportunities.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Sales people participate in both customer-service and sales activities.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a satisfactory experience using our services.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activities and provide the best solutions for our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	We believe our salespeople s product knowledge, skills to develop relationships of trust, and local presence differentiate us from our competition.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Technical consultants are subject-matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products and segments.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Both salespeople and technical consultants have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination among the groups.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through six different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary, de-identification of data.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S3	The agreements represent no cost to us, generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions, and required renewal.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S4	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S5	Again, those arrangements represent no cost to us, and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S6	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources, including federal, state, and local governments.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S7	Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members, who also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P45_S8	Lastly, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	We are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our information technology systems and the more recent adoption of cloud computing are fundamental to our success.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	They are used for the storage, processing, access, and delivery of the data that forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of the solutions we provide to our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained, and supported by approximately 25% of our employee population.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S4	We generally own, or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business, all the customer-facing applications, that are material to our operations.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S8	We are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P46_S10	We also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	The data center in Somerset, New Jersey is the recovery site for the Lehi, Utah data center and vice versa.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and data.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Security measures generally cover the following key areas: physical security, logical security of the perimeter, network security such as firewalls, logical access to the operating systems, deployment of virus detection software, and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	All laptops are encrypted, and media leaving our premises and sent to third-party storage facilities are also encrypted.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our commitment to security has earned from CyberTrust Security Certification (an industry leader in information security certification) since 2002.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software, and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (for example, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used.

1442145_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	To maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each customer a license to use our products and services, including our software and databases.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we employed 6,148 full-time and 166 part-time employees in our continuing operations.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	None of our employees are represented by unions.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our employees include more than 200 actuarial professionals, including 39 Fellows and 35 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial Society, as well as 149 Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 23 Certified and 23 Associate Insurance Data Managers, and more than 900 professionals with advanced degrees, including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public, and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service, and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in foreign countries.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose , and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	In certain instances, the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S5	We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory, or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S6	As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development, and related products and services to property/casualty insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules, and policy language.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P53_S7	We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurers' use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result, many of our operations and products are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Furthermore, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators, and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	We make available free of charge on or through this website, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	For access to the filings, click the SEC Filings" link on the Financial Information tab on our Investor Relations homepage.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Verisk trades on the NASDAQ Global Market in the Nasdaq Global Select Market segment under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The public may read and copy any materials filed by Verisk with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549.
1442145_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in any of our securities.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S7	In addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P0_S10	If a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	In addition, customers , employees or other s misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P1_S12	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , approximately 48.9% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S8	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance sector.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S10	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S12	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P8_S13	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P9_S12	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the U.S., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S11	In addition, on October 6, 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union, or E.U., invalidated the Safe Harbor provisions used by the Company and numerous other U.S. businesses to comply with E.U. s Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S12	The Company has implemented various measures to comply with the Data Protection Directive, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S13	If the Company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the Data Protection Directive, it will impede the ability to conduct business between the U.S. and the E.U. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P11_S14	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S10	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S13	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S14	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S15	Our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S16	Our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S17	However, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including Federal, State and International, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S18	Audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S19	Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S20	In addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S21	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S22	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S23	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S24	However, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S25	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S26	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S27	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S28	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S29	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S30	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S31	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P17_S32	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S8	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S10	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P19_S11	We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy , we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	General economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by Wood Mackenzie s customers for its products and services.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Demand for Wood Mackenzie s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of Wood Mackenzie s customers.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	A downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by Wood Mackenzie s customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Wood Mackenzie is based in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and conducts its principal operations outside the U.S. As a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the U.S. has increased materially.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The revenues and costs of Wood Mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As a result of the Acquisition, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in U.S. dollars, may differ materially from expectations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the U.K. s exit from the E.U. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The results of the referendum on June 23, 2016 in the U.K., to exit the E.U., which is commonly referred to as Brexit, and to potentially significantly change the U.K. s relationship with the E.U. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the U.K. and E.U. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the E.U. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual E.U. countries and negatively impact our European operations.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	An immediate consequence of the Brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the British pound.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Longer term, Brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the U.K. s relationship with the E.U., which could result in the U.K. losing access to certain aspects of the single E.U. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the U.K. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the E.U. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , our ten largest shareholders owned 39.6% of our common stock, including 5.1% of our common stock owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,666,698 shares of common stock were outstanding as of February 17, 2017 .
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Under Delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 16 states in the U.S., and offices outside the U.S. to support our international operations in Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K.
1442145_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Litigation On September 9, 2015, we were served with a nationwide putative class action complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County in Ohio naming our subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc. ( Intellicorp. ) titled Sherri Legrand v. Intellicorp Records, Inc. and The Cato Corporation et al.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on October 8, 2015.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S2	Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Class Action Complaint on November 5, 2015 ( Amended Complaint ), which like the prior complaint claims violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and alleges two putative class claims against Intellicorp, namely (i) a section 1681k(a) claim on behalf of all individuals who were the subjects of consumer reports furnished by Intellicorp which contained public record information in the Government Sanctions section of the report on or after September 4, 2013 and continuing through the date the class list is prepared and (ii) a section 1681e(b) claim on behalf of all individuals who were the subjects of consumer reports furnished by Intellicorp which contained public record information in the Government Sanctions section of the report where the address or social security number of the subject of the report do not match the social security number or address contained in the government database on or after September 4, 2013 and continuing through the date the class list is prepared.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S3	Count I of the Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Cato violated the FCRA by procuring consumer reports on the plaintiff and other class members without making the stand-alone disclosure required by FCRA section 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i).
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S4	Counts II and III allege that Intellicorp violated the FCRA section 1681e (b) by failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum accuracy of the adverse information included in its consumer reports and FCRA section 1681k (a) by failing to maintain strict procedures to assure that the public record information reported which was likely to have an adverse effect on the consumer was complete and up to date, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S5	The Amended Complaint alleges that defendants acted willfully and seeks statutory damages for the classes in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, equitable relief, costs and attorney s fees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P1_S6	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	On February 1, 2016, we were served with a nationwide putative class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina naming Intellicorp.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	The complaint titled Frank DiSalvo v. Intellicorp Records, Inc. claims violations of the FCRA and alleges a section 1681b(b)(1) claim on behalf of all individuals residing in the United States who were the subjects of consumer reports furnished by Intellicorp for employment purposes within the period prescribed by the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681p without first obtaining from the user of the report a certification that such user had complied with the obligations under Section 1681b(b)(2) as to the subject of the consumer report.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	The class complaint alleges that Intellicorp violated the FCRA section 1681b(b)(1) by failing to obtain the required specific certification from its customers to whom Intellicorp furnished consumer reports as to each consumer report provided before providing the specific consumer report that was the subject of the certification.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The complaint alleges that the violations were willful or in the alternative negligent and seeks statutory damages for the class in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, equitable relief, costs and attorney s fees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S4	On April 18, 2016, the parties filed a joint motion to stay all proceedings pending the resolution of the United States Supreme Court s decision in Spokeo v. Robins, No. 13-1339.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S5	After Spokeo was decided on May 16, 2016, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their federal court complaint and filed a virtually identical complaint in Ohio State court on May 27, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S6	Defendants removed that complaint to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on July 1, 2016, which on defendant s motion dismissed the complaint for failure to allege Article III standing and remanded the case to Ohio state court on September 27, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P2_S7	The parties agreed to resolve this matter for a non-material amount in the Settlement Agreement and Release executed on November 30, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	Xactware Solutions, Inc. Patent Litigation On October 8, 2015, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action titled Eagle View Technologies, Inc. and Pictometry International Group, Inc. v. Xactware Solutions, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	On November 30, 2015, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint ( First Amended Complaint ) adding Patent Nos. 376 and 737 to the Patents in Suit.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The First Amended Complaint seeks an entry of judgment by the Court that defendants have and continue to directly infringe and/or indirectly infringe, by way of inducement the Patents in Suit, permanent injunctive relief, damages, costs and attorney s fees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	Litigation On April 20, 2015, we were served with a putative class action titled John Weber v. Interthinx, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	The plaintiff, a former employee of our former subsidiary Interthinx, Inc. in Missouri, filed the class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on behalf of all review appraisers and individuals holding comparable positions with different titles who were employed by Interthinx for the last three years nationwide and who were not paid overtime wages.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P5_S2	The class complaint claims that the review appraiser employees were misclassified as exempt employees and, as a result, were denied certain wages and benefits that would have been received if they were properly classified as non-exempt employees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P5_S3	It pleads a Collective Action under section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid overtime and seeks overtime wages, liquidated damages, declaratory relief, interest, costs and attorneys fees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P6_S0	On March 11, 2014, we sold 100 percent of the stock of Interthinx, Inc.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P6_S1	The parties agreed to resolve this matter with our contribution of a non-material amount in the Class Action Settlement Agreement executed on November 8, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P6_S2	The hearing for the preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for February 21, 2017.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S0	Litigation On August 1, 2014, we were served with an Amended Complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado titled Snyder, et. al. v. ACORD Corp., et al.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S1	The action is brought by nineteen individual plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative class, against more than 120 defendants, including us and ISO.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S2	Except for us, ISO and the defendant Acord Corporation, which provides standard forms to assist in insurance transactions, most of the other defendants are property and casualty insurance companies that plaintiffs claim conspired to underpay property damage claims.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S3	Plaintiffs claim that we and ISO, along with all of the other defendants, violated state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws as well as state common law.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S4	On September 8, 2014, the Court entered an Order striking the Amended Complaint and granting leave to the plaintiffs to file a new complaint.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S5	On October 13, 2014, plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which was re-filed by plaintiffs to correct errors as the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S6	The Third Amended Complaint similarly alleges that the defendants conspired to underpay property damage claims, but does not specifically allege what role we or ISO played in the alleged conspiracy.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S7	It claims that we and ISO, along with all of the other defendants, violated state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws as well as state common law, and seeks all available relief including, injunctive, statutory, actual and punitive damages as well as attorneys fees.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S8	On January 15, 2016, the Court granted defendants motions to dismiss all claims asserted in the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S9	Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of this dismissal on February 16, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S10	The Court granted defendants motion to strike the motion for reconsideration on March 2, 2016 and gave plaintiffs leave to file another motion for reconsideration in accordance with the rules which plaintiffs filed on March 11, 2016 and, which was denied by the Court on April 25, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S11	On April 1, 2016, plaintiffs also filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court s January 15, 2016 Order, which dismissed all claims in the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S12	Plaintiffs also filed an appeal of the Court s denial of the motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit consolidated with the appeal of the Court s January 15, 2016 dismissal.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P7_S13	Appellants filed their brief in support of the consolidated appeal on July 21, 2016 and Appellees filed their brief in response on September 21, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P8_S0	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P9_S0	On February 19, 2016, we were served with a notice of a summons and complaint filed on January 29, 2016 against ISO in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut titled Halloran et al. v. Harleysville Preferred Insurance Co. et al.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P10_S0	As alleged in the First Amended Complaint, the putative class action is brought by four policyholders on behalf of a class of similarly situated policyholders in eastern Connecticut who allege that their homeowner s insurance carriers have denied or will deny their claims for damage to their homes caused by defective concrete.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P10_S1	The lawsuit alleges a breach of contract claim against certain insurers and seeks declaratory relief as to more than 100 other insurers.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P10_S2	It also alleges that ISO as the drafter of the standardized policy language at issue violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices ("CUTPA") and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act ("CUIPA").
1442145_17_ITEM3_P11_S0	The plaintiffs ask that the Court certify a class of persons similarly situated and seek relief in the form of the cost for the replacement of their concrete foundations and a declaratory judgment that all of the defendant insurance carriers are obligated to provide coverage for claims resulting from the defective concrete as well as, attorneys fees, costs and interest.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P12_S0	On March 17, 2016 plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint asserting federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act, adding a number of insurer defendants and amending their damages claim to include punitive damages.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P12_S1	After defendants indicated that they would be filing motions to dismiss the first amended complaint at a Rule 16 Conference on April 12, 2016, the Court gave plaintiffs until May 6, 2016 to move for leave to file a second amended complaint.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P13_S0	On May 6, 2016, plaintiffs filed a Motion to amend the first amended complaint with a proposed second amended complaint, which did not name ISO or us as a defendant.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P13_S1	No opposition was filed to the motion to amend, which was granted on October 4, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P13_S2	Instead of filing a second amended complaint, plaintiffs, in a joint motion for the modification of the case schedule filed on October 13, 2016, expressed their intention to move for leave to file a third amended complaint in order to drop certain additional defendants and to add other named plaintiffs.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P13_S3	Plaintiffs motion for leave to file a third amended complaint which does not name us as a defendant is pending before the District Court.
1442145_17_ITEM3_P14_S0	At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information Verisk trades under the ticker symbol VRSK on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

1442145_17_ITEM5_P0_S4	We believe the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of common stock is held in street name by brokers.
1442145_17_ITEM5_P0_S5	We have not paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock during the two most recent fiscal years and we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.

1442145_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , $636.0 million remains available for share repurchases.
1442145_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Under the Repurchase Program, we may repurchase stock in the market or as otherwise determined by us.

1442145_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected historical financial data should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, Item 7.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are derived from consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P0_S2	Between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 , we acquired 15 businesses (most notably Wood Mackenzie on May 19, 2015), which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P0_S3	Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations of our heathcare business and mortgage services business.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P0_S4	The following table sets forth our statement of operations for the years ended December 31:
1442145_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance for the years ended December 31:
1442145_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended December 31:
1442145_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	(1) On June 1, 2016 and March 11, 2014, we sold our healthcare business and mortgage services business, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P3_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare and mortgage services businesses are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P4_S0	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. (2) EBITDA is the financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P4_S1	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P4_S2	Because EBITDA is calculated from net income, this presentation includes EBITDA from discontinued operations of our healthcare business and mortgage services business.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P4_S3	In addition, references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues from continuing and discontinued operations.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P4_S4	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P5_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P5_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P6_S0	EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P7_S0	EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P8_S0	Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P9_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P9_S1	(4) Subsequent to our corporate reorganization on October 6, 2009, share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders equity, as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future.
1442145_17_ITEM6_P9_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we repurchased $333.3 million and $120.5 million, respectively, of treasury stock.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We enable our customers to make better decisions about risk, investments, and operations with greater precision, efficiency, and discipline.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	We also help customers across the globe protect and grow the value of people, property and financial assets.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are one of the largest aggregators and providers of data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P C, insurance risks.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, natural resources intelligence, and many other fields.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our customers use our solutions to make better decisions with greater efficiency and discipline.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our customers to make more logical decisions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our Risk Assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented 36.3% and 39.1% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our Decision Analytics segment provides solutions to our customer in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our Decision Analytics segment revenues represented approximately 63.7% and 60.9% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	On June 1, 2016 and March 11, 2014, we sold our healthcare business, Verisk Health, and mortgage services business, Interthinx, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare and mortgage services businesses are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We believe our business s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	We use year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 2 within Item 6.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	The respective GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	We use EBITDA growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	EBITDA growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	We also provide advisory services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 16.5% and 17.2% of our revenues were derived from providing transactional recurring and non-recurring solutions, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S7	We earn these revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S8	In general, they are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S9	For the the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 92.0% and 90.1% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S10	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the U.S.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S11	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 78.6% and 78.1% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S12	Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S13	Personnel expenses, which represented 47.7% and 46.5% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S14	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S15	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S16	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P10_S17	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions, which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S8	We serve customers in three primary vertical markets: P C insurance, energy, and financial services.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S9	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S10	A significant change in P C insurers profitability could affect the demand for our solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P11_S11	For insurers, the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Growth in P C insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013, 4.4% in 2014 and 3.7% in 2015.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	In recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability, and therefore, their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	Trends in the energy, chemicals, and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	Movements of commodity prices affect the profitability of our customers, which include energy, chemicals, and metals and mining companies, while stock markets and mergers and acquisitions, or M A, are some of the principal drivers affecting our financial institution customers.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P13_S7	Among the trends influencing commodity prices are supply and demand factors, regulatory requirements, fiscal impacts, regional market structures, and geopolitical risks.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, meeting in November 2016, oil prices have begun to recover indicating an uplift across the energy sector.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	After a prolonged slump in the metals and mining sector, there are emerging signs of optimism in the copper, aluminum and lithium markets among others.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	M A activity is also beginning to improve with high profile asset sales from Shell, Total, and BP among others.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	In addition, we have seen some large investments being made, notably the Glencore and Qatar deal with Rosneft, and the separate GE-Baker Hughes proposed transaction.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	Furthermore, Wood Mackenzie expects final investment decisions in the oil and gas sector to significantly increase in 2017, albeit from recent lows.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	However, volatility in commodity prices means uncertainty for our customers, which can impact their demand for our data and services.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Notwithstanding the unsettled view of the U.S. leadership towards the Paris global accord on climate change, over the longer term Wood Mackenzie expects a period of change in the energy mix.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The ongoing incentivizing of growth in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies around the world will help drive this, while fossil fuels are expected to remain a core part of energy demand for the foreseeable future.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	We will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in an increasingly complex market.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	Most notable among the recent trends affecting the vertical includes a significant increase in the number of alternative lenders and alternative payment instruments in the market.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S5	We are adapting our offerings to address the needs of alternative lenders, backed by our deep expertise and datasets covering the performance of customers across a full range of credit histories.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P15_S6	As well, our unique ability to analyze the customer adoption rates of new alternative payment instruments from our syndicated study datasets is enabling us to serve as the go to solution for the industry s analytic needs in the space.

1442145_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	In management s opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $138.5 million and $141.9 million, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues).
1442145_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.

1442145_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We paid fees associated with this financing arrangement of $ 9.1 million .

1442145_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,481.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the net proceeds from the debt and equity offerings of $1,244.0 million and $720.8 million, respectively, and other borrowings from our old and new credit facilities of 830.0 million and proceeds from stock option exercises and other option-related items of $76.5 million, partially offset by repayments of short-term and long-term debt of $340.0 million, and repurchases of common stock $20.4 million.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	Net cash used in financing activities of $579.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to the repurchase of common stock of $778.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and other stock option related items of $45.6 million and borrowing from our old credit facility of $160.0 million.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	(1) Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of our employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16.8 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S4	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $3.4 million.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P75_S5	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S4	The Company also has term-based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support, or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when-and-if available basis.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our customers on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S9	In these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S10	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S11	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S12	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P79_S13	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P80_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $3,588.9 million, which represents 77.5% of our total assets.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	During 2016 , we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2016 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	There have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of June 30, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Pension and Postretirement We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2016 , we determined this rate to be 3.99% , a decrease of 0.74% from the 4.73% rate used at December 31, 2015 .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P86_S8	Our postretirement rate is 3.25% at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1442145_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the pension plan assets were allocated 37.80% debt, 61.60% equity securities and 0.60% other.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S4	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S5	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P88_S6	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1442145_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.8 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2017, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $142.5 million, which will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	The net deferred income tax liability of $306.6 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(s) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2016 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $100.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2016 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $1.0 million based on our current borrowing levels.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A portion of our revenue is denominated in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against British pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If British pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in U.S. dollars will increase.
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	A hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Greentech Media, Inc., which was acquired on July 26, 2016, Analyze Re, Inc., which was acquired on October 20, 2016, and the GeoInformation Group Limited, which was acquired on November 11, 2016.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	The excluded financial statements of these acquisitions constitute approximately 0.2% of total assets and 0.3% of revenues collectively included within our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the effectivness of internal control over financial reporting for these acquisitions.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	As described in Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Greentech Media, Inc., which was acquired on July 26, 2016, Analyze Re, Inc., which was acquired on October 20, 2016, and the GeoInformation Group Limited, which was acquired on November 11,2016.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	The financial statements of these acquisitions constitute 0.2% of total assets and 0.3% of revenues collectively of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Greentech Media, Inc., Analyze Re, Inc. or the GeoInformation Group Limited.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S4	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P4_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1442145_17_ITEM8_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	Such indemnifications are primarily granted under licensing of computer software.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	Most agreements contain provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnifications; however, the Company is not able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P64_S6	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P64_S7	If the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company will determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	The carrying value of the long-term debt represents amortized cost less unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table during the years ended December 31:
1442145_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	The expected term for the stock options granted for a majority of the awards granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P164_S1	However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected term of the equity award.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P165_S2	The volatility factor for stock options granted prior to 2014 was based on the average volatility of the Company's peers as the Company did not have a history of stock price sufficient to cover the expected term of those awards.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P165_S3	The volatility factor for stock options granted in 2014 and 2015 was based on the volatility of the Company's stock.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P165_S4	The expected dividend yield was based on the Company s expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	The future benefit payments for the Postretirement Plan are net of the federal Medicare subsidy.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The healthcare cost trend rate for 2016 was 8.50% gradually decreasing to 5.00% in 2024.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P183_S1	Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P183_S2	A 1.00% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:
1442145_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	The subsidy from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the Company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2.1 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $54.0 thousand , $7.0 thousand and $10.0 thousand in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Company s investment guidelines target investment allocation of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	The Pension Plan assets consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and equity funds.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P185_S2	Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P185_S3	These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P185_S4	Investment managers are prohibited from entering into any speculative hedging transactions.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The investment objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P186_S1	The domestic equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 40% and 60% .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P186_S2	The international equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 10% and 20% .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P186_S3	The fixed income portion of the total portfolio should range between 20% and 40% .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P186_S4	The asset allocation at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and target allocation for 2017 by asset category are as follows:
1442145_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the Pension Plan.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P189_S1	The Company believes that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P189_S2	These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company also maintains a voluntary employees beneficiary association plan (the VEBA Plan ) under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code to fund the Postretirement Plan.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P192_S1	Fair Value Measurements for further discussion with respect to fair value hierarchy.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P192_S2	The following table summarizes the fair value measurements by level of the Pension Plan and Postretirement Plan assets:
1442145_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	(1) Valued at the closing price of shares for domestic stocks within the managed equity accounts, and valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) of shares for mutual funds at either the closing price reported in the active market or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings for corporate bonds held by the Pension Plan in these managed accounts.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	(2) The pooled separate accounts invest in domestic and foreign stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P194_S1	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the pooled separate account, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	(3) Investments for which readily determinable prices do not exist are valued by the General Partner using either the market or income approach.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	In establishing the estimated fair value of investments, including those without readily determinable values, the General Partner assumes a reasonable period of time for liquidation of the investment, and takes into consideration the financial condition and operating results of the underlying portfolio company, nature of investment, restrictions on marketability, holding period, market conditions, foreign currency exposures, and other factors the General Partner deems appropriate.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	(4) The fund invested in the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities or securities that are rated AAA by S P, AAA by Fitch, or Aaa by Moody s, including but not limited to mortgage securities such as agency and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and other obligations that are secured by mortgages or mortgage backed securities, and valued at the closing price reported in the active market.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	Segment Reporting ASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( ASC 280-10 ), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P198_S1	ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P198_S2	Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P198_S3	The Company s President and CEO is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280-10.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P198_S4	To align with the internal management of the Company s business operations based on service offerings, the Company is organized into the following two operating segments, which are also the Company s reportable segments: Decision Analytics:
1442145_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company develops solutions that its customers use to analyze key processes in managing risk.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	The Company s combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary data to generate solutions.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	In most cases, the Company s customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P200_S1	The Company also develops solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P200_S2	Fraud solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance and healthcare sectors.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P200_S3	The Company further leverages predictive models and proprietary data to advise customers to make asset investment and portfolio allocation decisions in the global energy market.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	On June 1, 2016 and March 11, 2014, the Company sold its healthcare business, Verisk Health, and mortgage services business, Interthinx, respectively.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P201_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare and mortgage services business are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P202_S1	The Company s databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P202_S2	The Company uses this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments for which separate discrete financial information is available and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S1	The Company uses EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S2	EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S3	Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S4	Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P203_S5	The Company does not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets or geographical locations.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	No individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10.0% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .

1442145_17_ITEM8_P209_S1	The Company had no related parties owning more than 5% of the entire class of stock as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P209_S2	In addition, the Company had no revenues from related parties for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1442145_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	Commitments and Contingencies: The Company s operations are conducted on leased premises.

1442145_17_ITEM8_P213_S2	With respect to ongoing matters, the Company is unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P213_S3	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_17_ITEM8_P213_S4	Although the Company believes it has strong defenses and intends to vigorously defend these matters, the Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	ISO s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting and rating functions.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, the Company effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Verisk common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009, under the ticker symbol VRSK.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Over the past two decades, we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	To further expand our business, in 2002, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, the technological leader in catastrophe modeling.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Segments We organize our business in two segments: Decision Analytics and Risk Assessment.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	See Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Decision Analytics Segment In the Decision Analytics segment, we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses, including predicting loss, selecting and pricing risk, detecting fraud before and after a loss event, and quantifying losses.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our businesses in this segment are categorized by the primary vertical end market for their services.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our solutions are built on unique data sets that are dynamic and updated based on new data and events.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our analytic methods and proprietary data sets combined with our deep industry expertise, provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	Insurance Our insurance solutions provide our customers analytics in the areas of fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, loss estimation, and underwriting, including emerging areas of interest within these categories.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P C insurance industry.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	Our anti-fraud solutions improve our customers profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S5	When a claim is submitted, our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insurers), that helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S6	The system searches for matches in identifying informational fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P16_S7	Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award, or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigation professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	The benefits of a single all-claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals, and possible fraud rings.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our database contains information for more than 1.2 billion claims and is the world s largest database of P C claims information used for claims and investigations.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Insurers and other participants submit new claims more than 200,000 a day on average across all categories of the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	We also provide an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims, and products that use link analysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	We are also a leader in and pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers, financial institutions, and government to manage their risk from extreme events.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	Our models, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophes.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	We have developed models for hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and floods in more than 100 countries, as well as pandemics worldwide.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S5	We have developed a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this evolving threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy, as well as models for estimating losses to crop insurance programs in the U.S., Canada and China.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P20_S6	Our newest models offer risk management solutions for the cyber and casualty lines of business.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	The program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings, and roofs.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 468 separate economic areas in North America.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	We revise this information monthly, and in the aftermath of a major disaster, we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect rapid price changes.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our structural repair and cleaning database contains approximately 21,000 unit-cost line items.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	For each line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous cleanup, we report time and material pricing, including labor, labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration), labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	We improve our reported pricing data by several methods including direct market surveys and an analysis of the actual claims experiences of our customers.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	We estimate that more than 80% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S4	Use of such a large percentage of the industry s claims data leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S5	Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S6	Our estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P23_S7	We also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. dating back to 1950.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators ensure that such insurers policies meet basic coverage requirements.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps ensure consistent treatment of claimants.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	We project customers' future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Those projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used their own data exclusively.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	For most P C insurers, in most lines of business, we believe that our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions is sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created from their data.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy, protection of data, and where necessary, de-identification of data.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	The agreements represent no cost to us, generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions, and require renewal.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	Third, we mine data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S6	Again, those arrangements represent no cost to us, and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P53_S7	Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources, including federal, state, and local governments.

1442145_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Regulation Because our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public, and non-public data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service, and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, in foreign countries.
1442145_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a permissible purpose , and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

1442145_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If there is a downturn in the U.S. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P C primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , approximately 48.9% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to U.S. P C primary insurers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the U.S. P C insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by P C primary insurers include the following:
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Such risks include, among other things:
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	There may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	The adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the P C insurance sector.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S13	If we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S15	If we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P11_S16	In addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	This protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the U.S., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	As a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	As we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management s time and attention.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver s Privacy Protection Act, the European Union s Data Protection Directive and its successor the General Data Protection Regulation, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	However, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, on October 6, 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union, or E.U., invalidated the Safe Harbor provisions used by the Company and numerous other U.S. businesses to comply with E.U. s Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	The Company has implemented various measures to comply with the Data Protection Directive and the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	If the Company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the Data Protection Directive and the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation, it will impede the ability to conduct business between the U.S. and the E.U. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer s business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	As a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S10	To the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S13	Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S14	To the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S15	Our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S17	However, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including Federal, State and International, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S18	Audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S19	Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S20	In addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S21	Our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S22	Our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S23	These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S24	However, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P22_S25	If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	General economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S9	Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S10	A significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P24_S11	We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	General economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by Wood Mackenzie s customers for its products and services.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Demand for Wood Mackenzie s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of Wood Mackenzie s customers.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by Wood Mackenzie s customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Wood Mackenzie is based in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and conducts its principal operations outside the U.S. As a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the U.S. has increased materially.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The revenues and costs of Wood Mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result of our acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in U.S. dollars, may differ materially from expectations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the U.K. s exit from the E.U. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The results of the referendum on June 23, 2016 in the U.K., to exit the E.U., which is commonly referred to as Brexit, and to potentially significantly change the U.K. s relationship with the E.U. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the U.K. and E.U. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the E.U. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual E.U. countries and negatively impact our European operations.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An immediate consequence of the Brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the British pound.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Longer term, Brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the U.K. s relationship with the E.U., which could result in the U.K. losing access to certain aspects of the single E.U. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the U.K. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the E.U. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , our ten largest shareholders owned 41.0% of our common stock, including 4.4% of our common stock owned by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or ESOP.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,703,249 shares of common stock were outstanding as of February 16, 2018 .
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Under Delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
1442145_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
1442145_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
1442145_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , our principal offices consisted of the following properties:
1442145_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also lease offices in 24 states in the U.S., and offices outside the U.S. to support our international operations in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and the U.K.
1442145_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations.
1442145_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including those matters described below.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	With respect to the ongoing matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Litigation On September 9, 2015, we were served with a nationwide putative class action complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County in Ohio naming our subsidiary Intellicorp Records, Inc., or Intellicorp, titled Sherri Legrand v. Intellicorp Records, Inc. and The Cato Corporation et al.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on October 8, 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Class Action Complaint on November 5, 2015, or Amended Complaint, which like the prior complaint claims violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA and alleges two putative class claims against Intellicorp, namely (i) a section 1681k(a) claim on behalf of all individuals who were the subjects of consumer reports furnished by Intellicorp, which contained public record information in the Government Sanctions section of the report on or after September 4, 2013 and continuing through the date the class list is prepared, and (ii) a section 1681e(b) claim on behalf of all individuals who were the subjects of consumer reports furnished by Intellicorp, which contained public record information in the Government Sanctions section of the report where the address or social security number of the subject of the report do not match the social security number or address contained in the government database on or after September 4, 2013 and continuing through the date the class list is prepared.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	Count I of the Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Cato violated the FCRA by procuring consumer reports on the plaintiff and other class members without making the stand-alone disclosure required by FCRA section 1681b(b)(2)(A)(i).
1442145_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	Counts II and III allege that Intellicorp violated the FCRA section 1681e (b) by failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum accuracy of the adverse information included in its consumer reports and FCRA section 1681k (a) by failing to maintain strict procedures to assure that the public record information reported, which was likely to have an adverse effect on the consumer was complete and up to date, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Amended Complaint alleges that defendants acted willfully and seeks statutory damages for the classes in an amount not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand dollars per violation, punitive damages, equitable relief, costs and attorney s fees.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	On April 24, 2017, the parties agreed to resolve the litigation in a Settlement Agreement and Release and plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Approval of the settlement on the same day.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	The settlement provides for a non-material cash payment by us, as well as certain non-monetary relief.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	The District Court granted the Motion for Preliminary Approval on April 25, 2017 and issued its Final Approval Order on October 31, 2017.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	Xactware Solutions, Inc. Patent Litigation On October 8, 2015, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action titled Eagle View Technologies, Inc. and Pictometry International Group, Inc. v. Xactware Solutions, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P4_S1	The complaint alleges that our Roof InSight, Property InSight and Aerial Sketch products infringe seven patents owned by Eagle View and Pictometry namely, Patent Nos. 436, 840, 152, 880, 770, 732 and 454.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P4_S2	On November 30, 2015, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding Patent Nos. 376 and 737 to the Patents in Suit.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P4_S3	The First Amended Complaint seeks an entry of judgment by the Court that defendants have and continue to directly infringe and/or indirectly infringe, by way of inducement the Patents-in-Suit, permanent injunctive relief, damages, costs and attorney s fees.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P4_S4	On May 17, 2017, the District Court so ordered a Joint Stipulated Order of Partial Dismissal with Prejudice dismissing all claims or assertions pertaining to Pictometry Patents Nos. 880 and 732 and certain enumerated claims or assertions pertaining to Eagle View Patents Nos. 436, 840, 152, 770, 454, 376 and 737, or collectively the Patents in Suit .
1442145_18_ITEM3_P5_S0	At this time, it is not reasonably possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to this matter.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S0	Litigation On August 1, 2014, we were served with an Amended Complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado titled Snyder, et. al. v. ACORD Corp., et al.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S1	The action is brought by nineteen individual plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative class, against more than 120 defendants, including us and ISO.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S2	Except for us, ISO and the defendant Acord Corporation, which provides standard forms to assist in insurance transactions, most of the other defendants are property and casualty insurance companies that plaintiffs claim conspired to underpay property damage claims.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S3	Plaintiffs claim that we and ISO, along with all the other defendants, violated state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws as well as state common law.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S4	On September 8, 2014, the Court entered an Order striking the Amended Complaint and granting leave to the plaintiffs to file a new complaint.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S5	On October 13, 2014, plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which was re-filed by plaintiffs to correct errors as the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S6	The Third Amended Complaint similarly alleges that the defendants conspired to underpay property damage claims, but does not specifically allege what role we or ISO played in the alleged conspiracy.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S7	It claims that we and ISO, along with all the other defendants, violated state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws as well as state common law, and seeks all available relief including injunctive, statutory, actual and punitive damages as well as attorneys fees.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S8	On January 15, 2016, the Court granted defendants motions to dismiss all claims asserted in the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S9	Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of this dismissal on February 16, 2016.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S10	The Court granted defendants motion to strike the motion for reconsideration on March 2, 2016 and gave plaintiffs leave to file another motion for reconsideration in accordance with the rules which plaintiffs filed on March 11, 2016 and, which was denied by the Court on April 25, 2016.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S11	On April 1, 2016, plaintiffs also filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court s January 15, 2016 Order, which dismissed all claims in the Third Amended Complaint.
1442145_18_ITEM3_P6_S12	Plaintiffs also filed an appeal of the Court s denial of the motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit consolidated with the appeal of the Court s January 15, 2016 dismissal.

1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information Verisk trades under the ticker symbol VRSK on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	Our common stock was first publicly traded on October 7, 2009.
1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of February 16, 2018 , the closing price of our common stock was $98.79 per share, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	As of February 16, 2018 , there were approximately 41 stockholders of record.
1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S4	We believe the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of common stock is held in street name by brokers.
1442145_18_ITEM5_P0_S5	We have not paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock during the two most recent fiscal years and we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.

1442145_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected historical financial data should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, Item 7.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 are derived from consolidated financial statements that are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Results for the year ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other future period.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	Between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017 , we acquired 22 businesses (most notably Wood Mackenzie on May 19, 2015), which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P0_S3	Our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations of our heathcare business and mortgage services business.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P0_S4	The following table sets forth our statement of operations for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	The financial operating data below sets forth the information we believe is useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performance for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	The following table sets forth our consolidated balance sheet data as of the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	(1) On June 1, 2016 and March 11, 2014, we sold our healthcare business and mortgage services business, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare and mortgage services businesses are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. (2) EBITDA is the financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P4_S2	Because EBITDA is calculated from net income, this presentation includes EBITDA from discontinued operations of our healthcare business and mortgage services business.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P4_S3	In addition, references to EBITDA margin, which is computed as EBITDA divided by revenues from continuing and discontinued operations.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P4_S4	See Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P5_S0	Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P5_S1	Management uses EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P7_S0	EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P8_S0	Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.
1442145_18_ITEM6_P9_S0	Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Selected Consolidated Financial Data.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented 35.9% and 36.3% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	On June 1, 2016, we sold our healthcare business, Verisk Health.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare business are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We believe our business s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We use year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures (see Note 2 within Item 6.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Selected Financial Data section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
1442145_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The respective GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	We use EBITDA growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	EBITDA growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	We use EBITDA margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Revenues We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	We recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P C insurance, medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	We also provide advisory services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , 19.2% and 16.5% of our revenues were derived from providing transactional recurring and non-recurring solutions, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	We earn these revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	In general, they are billed monthly at the end of each month.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S9	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , 75.2% and 78.6% of the revenues in our Decision Analytics segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S10	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , 90.8% and 92.0% of the revenues in our Risk Assessment segment were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S11	Our customers in this segment include most of the P C insurance providers in the U.S. Principal Operating Costs and Expenses Personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S12	Personnel expenses, which represented 50.1% and 47.7% of our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S13	We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S14	We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S15	A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P11_S16	While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions, which may offset margin expansion.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S6	A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S7	Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S8	We serve customers in three primary vertical markets: P C insurance, energy, and financial services.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S9	The industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S10	A significant change in P C insurers profitability could affect the demand for our solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S11	For insurers, the keys to profitability include increasing investment income, premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S12	Investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P12_S13	Growth in P C insurers direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013, 4.4% in 2014, 3.7% in 2015 and 3.7% in 2016.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	In recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth and tend to focus on making an underwriting profit.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	In addition, 2017 has been a challenging year for insurers with the catastrophe losses related to the three major hurricanes - Harvey, Irma, and Maria - making landfall in the U.S. in the third quarter 2017 causing insurance industry s net income to decline.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	These events also illustrate the need for broader coverages, such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	We continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers profitability, and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	Trends in the energy, chemicals, and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P14_S6	During 2017, oil prices showed a modest improvement and we expect a continued sense of optimism in the energy markets in 2018.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	In the upstream sector there are five global trends.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	First, capital investments are anticipated to grow moderately in 2018, signaling an end to the period of reductions since 2014.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Second, there is a surge in tight oil production in 2018 driven by a considerable increase from the Permian Basin in the U.S. (a region benefiting from new fracking production technology).
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	Third, over-supplies in the service sector provide an opportunity for operators to lock in prices below historical market rates.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Fourth, opportunities from discovered resources and exploration have been increasingly undertaken.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	Several Middle Eastern countries expect to award significant contracts to further develop discovered resources.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S5	In addition, there will likely be growing interest in Latin American opportunities.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S6	Fifth, many countries are reviewing their existing fiscal policies to ensure that they are competitive, as well as developing new terms to attract investment in new opportunities.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S7	In terms of the wider energy sector, we foresee the continued growth of the electric vehicle market, albeit from a low base, which is anticipated to develop into one of the most disruptive forces in the sector.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S8	Falling renewable energy costs around the world will also underpin the ongoing shift towards a low carbon economy.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P16_S9	We will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic market and remain increasingly well positioned to serve our customers' information and analytical needs.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	As we look forward towards 2018, increasing trends in delinquency and fraud rates have resulted in an increased demand for robust risk solutions.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $16.9 million, an ESOP charge of $6.2 million, and information technology expense of $4.2 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	These increases were offset by decreases in data costs and data processing fees of $0.2 million and other operating costs of $3.2 million.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $6.8 million, an ESOP charge of $1.9 million, and professional consulting fees of $1.4 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P59_S4	These increases were offset by decreases in information technology expense of $1.3 million and other general expenses of $1.9 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	The EBITDA margin for our Decision Analytics segment, including our discontinued operations, was 60.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 46.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by the discontinued operations, including the gain on sale of our healthcare business, of 15.6%, which was partially offset by the impact from an ESOP charge of 0.6%.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	The nonrecurring derivative gain, net of transaction costs related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition and the warrant exercise and payout, positively impacted our EBITDA margin by 5.4%, which was offset by the impact from the discontinued operations of 5.9% for year ended December 31, 2015.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Revenue growth within this segment primarily resulted from an increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the content of the solutions within our industry-standard insurance programs as well as selling expanded solutions to existing customers.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our revenue by category for the periods presented is set forth below for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Cost of revenues for our Risk Assessment segment was $223.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $200.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $23.7 million or 11.9%.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our recent acquisitions within this segment, accounted for an increase of $0.7 million in SGA, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	Excluding costs associated with our recent acquisitions, SGA increased $4.2 million or 5.1%.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	The increase was primarily due to an ESOP charge of $2.4 million, increases in professional consulting costs of $1.6 million, information technology expenses of $0.4 million, and other general expense of $1.0 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	These increases were offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefit costs of $1.2 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 57.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 59.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

1442145_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	In management s opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $146.1 million and $138.5 million, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues).
1442145_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our consolidated capital expenditures as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , were 8.6% and 7.4%, respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P73_S3	We estimate our capital expenditures for 2018 will be approximately $230.0 million, which primarily consists of expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	We have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we repurchased $276.3 million , $326.8 million and $20.4 million , respectively, of our common stock.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S4	Financing and Financing Capacity We had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, the discounts and debt issuance costs on our senior notes and our committed senior unsecured Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility, or the Credit Facility, of $3,015.0 million and $2,400.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S5	The debt at December 31, 2017 primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2015, 2012 and 2011 and borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility described below.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S6	Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P74_S7	The discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "Long-term debt" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K over the life of the respective senior note.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,300.0 million outstanding, and we were in compliance with our financial debt covenants.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	We have a credit facility with Bank of America N.A., JP Morgan Chase, N.A., Sun Trust Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., Royal Bank of Canada, BNP Paribas, TD Bank, N.A., and The Northern Trust Company.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	On May 18, 2017, we entered into the third amendment to the Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the maturity date one year to May 15, 2022.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions and the share repurchase program, or the Repurchase Program.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Credit Facility contains certain financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	These covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that we maintain, during any period of four fiscal quarters, a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending upon the consolidated funded debt leverage ratio.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we had borrowings of $870.0 million and repayments of $255.0 million under the credit facility.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $715.0 million and $100.0 million , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	In January 2018, we repaid a total of $110.0 million of the $715.0 million outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2017 under the Credit Facility.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	On May 18, 2017, we entered into the third amendment to the Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the maturity date one year to May 15, 2022.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	On March 10, 2015, in connection with our agreement to acquire Wood Mackenzie, we entered into a commitment letter for a $2,300.0 million 364 -day bridge financing arrangement with Bank of America N.A. and Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. acting as joint lead arrangers.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	This financing arrangement was only to be utilized in the event we did not complete the debt and equity offerings relating to its acquisition of Wood Mackenzie by a certain date, and was terminated upon the closing of the acquisition.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	We paid fees associated with this financing arrangement of $9.1 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	Due to the completion of the debt and equity offerings, this arrangement was terminated and the full $9.1 million of fees were recorded to "Interest expense" for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P79_S4	The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $743.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $577.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase of $166.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by an increase in revenues and operating profit.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a $99.9 million tax payment related to the gain on the sale of our healthcare business and a one time cash funding of our ESOP plan of $18.8 million .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	These operating cash expenditures in 2016 did not occur in 2017.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S4	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $577.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $663.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S5	The decrease of $86.3 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the additional income tax payments of $99.9 million related to the gain on the sale of our healthcare business and a one time cash funding of our ESOP plan of $18.8 million, partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by an increase in revenues and operating profit as well as additional operating cash flow from the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie in May 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S6	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $ 1,105.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to acquisitions, including escrow funding, of $914.9 million and capital expenditures of $183.5 million .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S7	Net cash provided by investing activities of $493.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to proceeds from the sale our healthcare business of $714.6 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $156.5 million and acquisitions including escrow payments of $74.1 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S8	Net cash used in investing activities of $3,006.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to acquisitions including escrow payments of $2,856.4 million, which includes the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, net of a gain on derivative instruments and capital expenditures of $166.1 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S9	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities of $362.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to $615.0 million of borrowings, net under our Credit Facilities and proceeds from stock option exercises, net of net share settlement of taxes from restricted stock, of $32.1 million, partially offset by share repurchases of $276.3 million .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S10	Net cash used in financing activities of $1,064.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a $770.0 million repayments of borrowings under our Credit Facilities and share repurchases of $326.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and other option-related items of $38.0 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P80_S11	Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,440.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the net proceeds from the debt and equity offerings of $1,244.0 million and $720.8 million, respectively, and other borrowings from our old and new credit facilities of 830.0 million and proceeds from stock option exercises and other option-related items of $36.4 million, partially offset by repayments of short-term and long-term debt of $340.0 million, and repurchases of common stock of $20.4 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) Our funding policy is to contribute at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	(2) Other long-term liabilities consist of our employee-related deferred compensation plan.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	We also have a deferred compensation plan for our Board of Directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	(3) Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16.3 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $4.5 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P82_S5	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P83_S4	Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	Revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Company also has term-based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support, or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when-and-if available basis.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S5	The Company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S6	The PCS associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S7	The Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P84_S8	In addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our customers on a monthly basis in arrears.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	We have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P85_S3	We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P85_S4	Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S4	We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P86_S5	The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had goodwill of $3,368.7 million , which represents 56.0% of our total assets.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	During 2017 , we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2017 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	As part of this process, we conducted the annual impairment test of our energy reporting unit at June 30, 2017, at which time the fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10.0%.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	This outcome is consistent with our expectation due to the decline in the GBP/USD exchange rate as well as current energy market conditions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	The carrying value of the goodwill associated with our energy reporting unit was $1,841.8 million as of June 30, 2017.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	There have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of June 30, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	Management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Pension and Postretirement We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	This standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S5	Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S6	The output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S7	For our pension plans at December 31, 2017 , we determined this rate to be 3.50% , a decrease of 0.49% from the 3.99% rate used at December 31, 2016 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P95_S8	Our postretirement rate was 3.00% at December 31, 2017 , a decrease of 0.25% from the 3.25% rate used at December 31, 2016 .
1442145_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.0% debt securities and 60.0% equity securities.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the pension plan assets were allocated 37.9% debt, 54.0% equity securities and 8.1% other.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S3	We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S4	The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S5	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P97_S6	We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under Medicare Part D was effectively changed.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	This legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	We are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1442145_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Income Taxes In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of ASC 740 , which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act, or Tax Act.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	The Tax Act makes complex changes to the tax law which will impact the 2017 year, including but not limited to 1) a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the corporate tax rate change from 35.0% to 21.0% , 2) 100% bonus depreciation on qualifying property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and 3) requiring a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Based on our initial analysis of the Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of its 2017 impact and have recorded provisional adjustments as follows: 1) Due to the federal corporate rate reduction, a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in the recording of a benefit of approximately $89.1 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	2) 100% bonus depreciation on qualifying assets resulted in an estimated decrease to the current income tax payable of approximately $8.0 million.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	3) We are not expected to be impacted by the one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	The Tax Act will also affect 2018 and forward, including but not limited to 1) a reduction in the federal corporate rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , 2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, 3) creation of a new minimum tax - the base erosion anti-abuse tax, or BEAT, 4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, 6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense, 7) the repeal of Section 199 domestic production activity deduction, 8) a new limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, 9) limitations on net operating losses, or NOL s, generated after December 31, 2017, 10) a special deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, or FDII, and various other items.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	We have evaluated the above provisions and other than the reduction in corporate tax rate, we do not believe that the new provisions will have a material impact on the provision for income taxes.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.5 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2018, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $211.5 million, which will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2037.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
1442145_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The net deferred income tax liability of $321.9 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2(r) to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $715.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2017 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $7.2 million based on our current borrowing levels.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A portion of our revenue is denominated in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the U.S. dollar strengthens against British pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in British pounds and other foreign currencies.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If British pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in U.S. dollars will increase.
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM7A_P1_S6	A hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting for our acquisitions in 2017 (See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K).
1442145_18_ITEM8_P2_S3	The excluded financial statements of these acquisitions constitute approximately 2.0% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets which were integrated into the Company's systems and control environment) and 1.9% of revenues collectively included within our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P2_S4	Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for these acquisitions.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , as stated in their report which is included herein.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Verisk Analytics, Inc.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 , of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Arium Limited, which was acquired on January 21, 2017, Healix International Holdings Limited, which was acquired on February 16, 2017, Emergent Network Intelligence Limited, which was acquired on February 24, 2017, Fintellix Solutions Private Limited, which was acquired on March 31, 2017, MAKE Consulting A/S, which was acquired on May 19, 2017, Aerial Imagery group of companies, which were acquired during the three months ended June 30, 2017, G2 Web Services LLC, which was acquired on August 3, 2017, Sequel Business Solutions Ltd., which was acquired on August 23, 2017, Lundquist Consulting, Inc., which was acquired on August 31, 2017, Rebmark Legal Solutions Ltd., which was acquired on November 9, 2017, Service Software, LLC., which was acquired on December 22, 2017 and PowerAdvocate, Inc., which was acquired on December 29, 2017 (collectively the 2017 acquired businesses ).
1442145_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	The financial statements of the 2017 acquired businesses constitute 2.0% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets which were integrated into the Company's systems and control environment) and 1.9% of revenues collectively of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the 2017 acquired businesses.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Verisk Analytics, Inc.

1442145_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1442145_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act ("Tax Act").
1442145_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	The Tax Act makes complex changes to the tax law which will impact the 2017 year, including but not limited to 1) a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the corporate tax rate change from 35.0% to 21.0% , 2) 100% bonus depreciation on qualifying property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and 3) requiring a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	Based on the initial analysis of the Tax Act, the Company has made reasonable estimates of its 2017 impact and has recorded provisional adjustments as follows: 1) Due to the federal corporate rate reduction, a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in the recording of a benefit of approximately $89.1 million .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	2) 100% bonus depreciation on qualifying assets resulted in an estimated decrease to the current income tax payable of approximately $8.0 million .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P162_S2	3) The Company is not expected to be impacted by the one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P162_S3	The Tax Act will also affect 2018 and forward, including but not limited to 1) a reduction in the federal corporate rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , 2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, 3) creation of a new minimum tax - the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("BEAT"), 4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), 6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense, 7) the repeal of Section 199 domestic production activity deduction, 8) a new limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, 9) limitations on net operating losses ("NOL s") generated after December 31, 2017, 10) a special deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII") and various other items.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P162_S4	The Company has evaluated the above provisions and other than the reduction in corporate tax rate, it does not believe that the new provisions will have a material impact on the provision for income taxes.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	The reconciliation between the Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the statutory tax rate is as follows for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lowered federal income tax rates as a result of U.S. Tax Reform and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, partially offset by legislation enacted in the U.K.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	The tax effects of significant items comprising the Company s deferred tax assets as of December 31 are as follows:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	The net deferred income liability of $321.9 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	The Company has provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the interest expense deduction limitation in the U.K.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P166_S2	The Company has also provided for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating losses of certain subsidiaries.

1442145_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	to fully realize the deferred tax assets is uncertain.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P168_S1	Other than these items, the Company has determined, based on the Company s historical operating performance, that taxable income of the Company will more likely than not be sufficient to fully realize the deferred tax assets.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholdings taxes for any additional outside basis difference inherent in its foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.

1442145_18_ITEM8_P209_S2	The total grant date fair value of restricted stock vested during the year ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $17.6 million , $14.4 million and $16.3 million , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The Company also offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").
1442145_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	Under the ESPP, participating employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 20.0% of their regular base salary and up to 50.0% of their short-term incentive compensation, both of which in total may not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars in any calendar year, to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a 5.0% discount of its fair market value at the time of purchase.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	In accordance with ASC 718, the ESPP is noncompensatory as the purchase discount is 5.0% or less from the fair market value, substantially all employees that meet limited employment qualifications may participate, and it incorporates no option features.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company issued 29,605 , 29,867 and 25,599 shares of common stock at a weighted average discounted price of $81.38 , $76.75 and $70.27 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company has a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain of its employees through membership in the Pension Plan for Insurance Organizations (the Pension Plan ), a multiple-employer trust.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	Prior to the freeze, the Company applied a cash balance formula to determine future benefits.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	Under the cash balance formula, each participant has an account, which was credited annually based on salary rates determined by years of service, as well as the interest earned on the previous year-end cash balance.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S3	The Company also has a non-qualified frozen supplemental cash balance plan ( SERP ) for certain employees.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S4	The SERP is funded from the general assets of the Company.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S5	The Pension Plan s funding policy is to contribute annually at an amount between the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S6	The minimum contribution requirement was and is expected to be $0 in 2017 and 2018 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P212_S7	The Company contributed $0.9 million and $1.0 million to the SERP in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and expects to contribute $0.8 million in 2018 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for both active and retired employees.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	The Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Plan (the Postretirement Plan ), which has been frozen, is contributory, requiring participants to pay a stated percentage of the premium for coverage.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company does not expect to contribute to the Postretirement Plan in 2018 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligations and the plan assets, the (funded) unfunded status of the Pension Plan, SERP and Postretirement Plan, and the amounts recognized in the Company s consolidated balance sheets at December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	The pre-tax components included within accumulated other comprehensive losses as of December 31 are summarized below:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The pre-tax components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost and the amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss are summarized below for the years ended December 31:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	The estimated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive losses that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost during 2018 are summarized below:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are provided below:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	The following table presents the estimated future benefit payments for the respective plans.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P219_S1	The future benefit payments for the Postretirement Plan are net of the federal Medicare subsidy.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	The healthcare cost trend rate for 2017 was 8.75% gradually decreasing to 4.50% in 2035.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P220_S1	Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P220_S2	However, a 1.00% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have an immaterial effect to our postretirement benefit obligation.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P220_S3	The subsidy from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the Company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.6 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $2.0 thousand , $54.0 thousand and $7.0 thousand in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P220_S4	The expected return on the Pension Plan assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 7.00% and 7.25% , respectively, which was determined by taking into consideration the Company s analysis of its actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast after adjusting for the target investment allocation and reflecting the current economic environment.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company s investment guidelines target investment allocation of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P221_S1	The Pension Plan assets consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and equity funds.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P221_S2	Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P221_S3	These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P221_S4	Investment managers are prohibited from entering into any speculative hedging transactions.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	The investment objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P222_S1	The domestic equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 40% and 60% .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P222_S2	The international equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 10% and 20% .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P222_S3	The fixed income portion of the total portfolio should range between 20% and 40% .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P222_S4	The asset allocation at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and target allocation for 2018 by asset category are as follows:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P224_S0	The expected return for each investment category within the target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the Pension Plan.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P224_S1	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P224_S2	The Company believes that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P224_S3	These considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company also maintains a voluntary employees beneficiary association plan (the VEBA Plan ) under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code to fund the Postretirement Plan.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P225_S1	The asset allocation for the VEBA Plan at December 31, 2017 and target allocation for 2018 are 100% in debt securities.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	There were no transfers among Levels 1, 2 or 3 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	Fair Value Measurements for further discussion with respect to fair value hierarchy.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P227_S1	The following table summarizes the fair value measurements by level of the Pension Plan and Postretirement Plan assets:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	(1) Valued at the closing price of shares for domestic stocks within the managed equity accounts, and valued at the net asset value ( NAV ) of shares for mutual funds at either the closing price reported in the active market or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings for corporate bonds held by the Pension Plan in these managed accounts.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P228_S1	(2) The pooled separate accounts invest in domestic and foreign stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P228_S2	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the pooled separate account, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	(3) Investments for which readily determinable prices do not exist are valued by the General Partner using either the market or income approach.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P230_S0	In establishing the estimated fair value of investments, including those without readily determinable values, the General Partner assumes a reasonable period of time for liquidation of the investment, and takes into consideration the financial condition and operating results of the underlying portfolio company, nature of investment, restrictions on marketability, holding period, market conditions, foreign currency exposures, and other factors the General Partner deems appropriate.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	collateralized mortgage obligations, and other obligations that are secured by mortgages or mortgage backed securities, and valued at the closing price reported in the active market.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P231_S1	(5) The funds invested in common stocks and other equity securities issued by domestic and foreign real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts ("REIT") and similar REIT-like entities.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P231_S2	The fair values of these stocks, bonds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and are used in determining the NAV of the funds, which is not publicly quoted.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	Segment Reporting ASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( ASC 280-10 ), establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P232_S1	ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P232_S2	Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P232_S3	The Company s President and CEO is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280-10.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P232_S4	To align with the internal management of the Company s business operations based on service offerings, the Company is organized into the following two operating segments, which are also the Company s reportable segments: Decision Analytics:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Company develops solutions that its customers use to analyze key processes in managing risk.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P233_S1	The Company s combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary data to generate solutions.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P233_S2	In most cases, the Company s customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes to earthquakes.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Company develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P234_S1	The Company also develops solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss events occur.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P234_S2	Fraud solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance sector.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P234_S3	The Company further leverages predictive models and proprietary data to advise customers to make asset investment and portfolio allocation decisions in the global energy market.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	On June 1, 2016, the Company sold its healthcare business, Verisk Health.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P235_S1	Results of operations for the healthcare business are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for all prior periods presented.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P235_S2	Refer to Note 9 for more information.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company is the leading provider of statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P C insurance industry.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P236_S1	The Company s databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P236_S2	The Company uses this data to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S0	The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments for which separate discrete financial information is available and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S1	The Company uses EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S2	EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S3	Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S4	Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P237_S5	The Company does not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segment s overall operating performance.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P238_S0	The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets or geographical locations.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P238_S1	On a geographic basis, revenues from countries outside of the U.S. accounted for 21.7% , 22.6% and 18.2% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P238_S2	No individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10.0% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .

1442145_18_ITEM8_P242_S3	In addition, the Company had no revenues from related parties for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1442145_18_ITEM8_P243_S0	Commitments and Contingencies: The Company s operations are conducted on leased premises.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P243_S1	Approximate minimum rentals under long-term noncancelable leases for all leased premises, computer equipment and automobiles are as follows:
1442145_18_ITEM8_P244_S0	Most of the leases require payment of property taxes and utilities and, in certain cases, contain renewal options.

1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S1	Capital leases consist of computer equipment, office equipment, and leased automobiles.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S2	Rent expense on operating leases approximated $39.0 million , $39.5 million and $37.3 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S3	In addition, the Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including the matters described below.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S4	With respect to ongoing matters, the Company is unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S5	This is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed.
1442145_18_ITEM8_P245_S6	Although the Company believes it has strong defenses and intends to vigorously defend these matters, the Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
