889900_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	We own and operate one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs in the United States.
889900_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company was formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our contract drilling business operates primarily in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 356 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	A drilling rig is considered marketable at a point in time if it is operating or can be made ready to operate without significant capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components.
889900_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	We also own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a working interest owner.
889900_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Prior to January 20, 2010, we provided drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and on land in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
889900_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	We sold our drilling and completion fluids services business on January 20, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	On October 1, 2010 we acquired the assets and operations of a pressure pumping business and an electric wireline business.
889900_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The electric wireline business that we acquired was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010 and sold on January 27, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The results of our drilling and completion fluids services business and our electric wireline business are presented as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
889900_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	oil and natural gas exploration and production.
889900_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	All of our industry segments had operating profits in 2010 and 2008.
889900_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In 2009, our pressure pumping services and oil and natural gas exploration and production segments had operating profits and our contract drilling services segment had an operating loss.
889900_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	General We market our contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had 356 marketable land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our marketable drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 5,000 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Of these drilling rigs, 124 are electric rigs and 232 are mechanical rigs.
889900_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the diesel power (the sole energy source for a mechanical rig) into electricity to power the rig.
889900_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as replacement parts for marketable rigs.
889900_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs to ensure that our drilling equipment is competitive.
889900_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have spent $1.4 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs, and (2) modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling fleet.
889900_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we spent approximately $656 million, $395 million and $361 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and qualified personnel.
889900_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently one to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	During 2010, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 21 days.
889900_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for the payment of an early termination fee to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Generally, we indemnify our customers against claims by our employees and claims that might arise from surface pollution caused by spills of fuel, lubricants and other solvents within our control.
889900_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Generally, the customers indemnify us against claims that might arise from other surface and subsurface pollution.
889900_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to industry conditions or other factors.
889900_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork, footage or turnkey basis, or a combination thereof.
889900_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	In each case, we provide the rig and crews.
889900_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our bid for each job depends upon location, depth and anticipated complexity of the well, on-site drilling conditions, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed well.
889900_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The customer supervises the drilling of the well.
889900_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Except for two wells drilled under footage contracts in 2009, all of the wells we drilled in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were under daywork contracts.
889900_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Under footage contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot.
889900_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The customer provides drilling fluids, casing, cementing and well design expertise.
889900_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	These contracts require us to bear the cost of services and supplies that we provide until the well has been drilled to the agreed-upon depth.
889900_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	If we drill the well in less time than estimated, we have the opportunity to improve our profits over those that would be attainable under a daywork contract.
889900_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	Profits are reduced and losses may be incurred if the well requires more days to drill to the contracted depth than estimated.
889900_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Footage contracts generally contain greater risks for a drilling contractor than daywork contracts.
889900_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	certain risks associated with loss of the well from fire, blowouts and other risks.
889900_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	We drilled two wells under footage contracts in 2009, and we did not drill any wells under footage contracts in 2010 or 2008.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Under turnkey contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed fee.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	In a turnkey arrangement, we are required to bear the costs of services, supplies and equipment beyond those typically provided under a footage contract.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	In addition to the drilling rig and crew, we are required to provide the drilling and completion fluids, casing, cementing, and the technical well design and engineering services during the drilling process.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	We also typically assume certain risks associated with drilling the well such as fires, blowouts, cratering of the well bore and other such risks.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	Compensation occurs only when the agreed- upon scope of the work has been completed, which requires us to make larger up-front working capital commitments prior to receiving payments under a turnkey drilling contract.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S5	Under a turnkey contract, we have the opportunity to improve our profits if the drilling process goes as expected and there are no complications or time delays.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S6	Given the increased exposure we have under a turnkey contract, however, profits can be significantly reduced and losses can be incurred if complications or delays occur during the drilling process.
889900_11_ITEM1_P30_S7	Turnkey contracts generally involve the highest degree of risk among the three different types of drilling contracts.
889900_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Although we have entered into turnkey contracts in the past, we did not enter into any turnkey contracts in the past three years.
889900_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Includes standby days under term contracts where revenue was earned but the rig was not working.
889900_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	The number of these standby days under term contracts was zero in 2010, 2,070 in 2009 and 486 in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment We estimate the depth capacity with respect to our marketable rigs as of December 31, 2010 to be as follows:
889900_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	At December 31, 2010, we owned and operated 317 trucks and 402 trailers used to rig down, transport and rig up our drilling rigs.
889900_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our ownership of trucks and trailers reduces our dependency upon third parties for these services and generally enhances the efficiency of our contract drilling operations, particularly in periods of high drilling rig utilization.
889900_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Most repair and overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment is performed at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	General We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	well stimulation through fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Equipment Our pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2010 includes equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrogen fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services as follows:
889900_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	We own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a working interest owner.
889900_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in producing regions of Texas and New Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	The customers of each of our contract drilling and pressure pumping business segments are oil and natural gas operators.
889900_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our customer base includes both major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	During 2010, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand in our markets.
889900_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor in our markets, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	In addition to price, we believe availability and condition of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job in the markets in which we operate.
889900_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous Federal, state, foreign, and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by Federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	The adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	Federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	Any suspension or moratorium of the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a Federal, state, foreign or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under Federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_11_ITEM1_P51_S5	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into waters from facilities.
889900_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of Federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the Federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
889900_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shales.
889900_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the Federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	In Canada, a variety of Canadian federal, provincial and municipal laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	These laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our operations are also subject to Federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_11_ITEM1_P64_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the drilling business, including:
889900_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	These and other hazards could cause:
889900_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	serious damage or destruction of the equipment involved and, in addition to environmental damage, could cause substantial damage to producing formations and surrounding areas.
889900_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Damage to the environment, including property contamination in the form of either soil or ground water contamination, could also result from our operations, including through:
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Such risks include personal injury, well disasters, extensive fire damage, damage to the environment, and other hazards.
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, and workers compensation insurance.
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S3	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S4	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets, and we do not carry insurance against loss of earnings resulting from such damage.
889900_11_ITEM1_P69_S5	Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	In addition to insurance coverage, we also attempt to obtain indemnification from our customers for certain risks.
889900_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	These indemnity agreements typically require our customers to hold us harmless in the event of loss of production or reservoir damage.
889900_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	There is no assurance that we will obtain such contractual indemnity, and if obtained, whether such indemnity will be enforceable, whether the customer will be able to satisfy such indemnity or whether such indemnity will be supported by adequate insurance maintained by the customer.
889900_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	We had approximately 7,000 full-time employees at December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Seasonality does not significantly affect our overall operations.
889900_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada and, to a lesser extent, our pressure pumping operations in the Appalachian Basin, are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual Spring thaw.
889900_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	Although, these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009, there was a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Furthermore, these factors resulted in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although the significant deterioration in the global economic environment appeared to stabilize to some degree during 2010, there is no assurance that the global economic environment could not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A return of the conditions causing a deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Declines in Oil and Natural Gas Prices Have Adversely Affected Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, to set and maintain production and price targets.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	During 2008, the monthly average market price of natural gas (monthly average Henry Hub price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) peaked in June at $13.06 per Mcf before rapidly declining to an average of $5.99 per Mcf in December.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In 2009, the monthly average market price of natural gas declined further to a low of $3.06 per Mcf in September.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The monthly average market price of natural gas has not recovered to levels experienced during early 2008 and was $4.38 per Mcf in December 2010.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	This volatility and the extended declines in the market price of natural gas resulted in our customers significantly reducing their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low through 2009 before increasing somewhat in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The increase in 2010 can be attributed partially to increased activity in oil rich basins as a result of the growing development of unconventional oil reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil compared to 2009.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Although our average number of rigs operating increased during 2010, it remains well below the number of our available rigs.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last ten years has significantly contributed to excess capacity.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S7	As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined significantly from historic highs.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S8	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Low market prices for natural gas and oil would likely result in low demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The North American land drilling industry has experienced periods of downturn in demand over the last decade.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have sustained losses during the downturn periods.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased recently and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Construction of new drilling rigs increased significantly during the last ten years.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The addition of new drilling rigs to the market and the recent decrease in demand has resulted in excess capacity.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As a result, we believe there has been, and we expect there to continue to be, a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	The addition of new pressure pumping equipment, as well as any general decline in demand for pressure pumping services, could result in there being substantially more pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If this were to occur, providers of pressure pumping services will have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Shortages of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment and materials, including proppants and gels for our pressure pumping operations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply due to vendor or other issues could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	These price increases and delays in delivery may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Severe shortages or delays in delivery could limit our ability to operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Oil Service Business Segments in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	At times, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The fact that drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In recent years, many drilling and pressure pumping companies have consolidated or merged with other companies.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Although this consolidation has decreased the total number of competitors, we believe the competition for drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be intense.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Labor Shortages and Rising Labor Costs Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	During periods of increasing demand for contract drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry experiences shortages of qualified personnel.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	During these periods, our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to market and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment is adversely affected, which negatively impacts both our operations and profitability.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Operationally, it is more difficult to hire qualified personnel, which adversely affects our ability to mobilize inactive rigs and pressure pumping equipment in response to the increased demand for such services.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Additionally, wage rates for drilling and pressure pumping personnel are likely to increase during periods of increasing demand, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions are Not Assured.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The land drilling and pressure pumping industries have experienced significant consolidation, and there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity would be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Nature of our Business Operations Presents Inherent Risks of Loss that, if not Insured or Indemnified Against, Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, which in turn could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, or serious damage to our equipment.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our operations could also cause environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We maintain insurance coverage and have indemnification agreements with many of our customers.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	However, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements would be enforceable or adequately protect us against liability or losses from all consequences of these hazards.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Additionally, there can be no assurance that insurance would be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs would not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	It is possible that a customer or insurer could fail or be unable to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, which could result in a material loss.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Moreover, we could suffer a material loss if we were to become subject to an unexpected judgment against us for which we are uninsured, for which indemnification is unenforceable or otherwise not available or that is beyond the amounts we reserved or anticipated incurring.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverages and a $2.0 million per occurrence self insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Difficulties Integrating Our Recently Acquired Pressure Pumping Assets Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We expect that our recently acquired pressure pumping assets will complement and expand our business.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Successfully integrating the acquired business depends on our ability to integrate the acquired assets and personnel and to maintain and grow the acquired customer base.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We may encounter challenges in integrating the acquired business with our existing operations and management.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We may not be able to fully take advantage of expected business opportunities, including successfully developing new markets and retaining acquired customers.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	The integration of the new business may place additional strain on our management.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, the acquired business may not achieve anticipated results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P33_S6	If the acquired business is not successfully integrated, our operating results could be adversely affected.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have borrowings outstanding under a term loan and our senior notes.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Environmental Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous Federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to substantial civil and criminal penalties.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Result in Operational Delays.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ) are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Both the EPA and the U.S. Congress are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing activities and soil or ground water contamination.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As part of their respective studies, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and the EPA each sent requests to a number of companies, including our company for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We have responded to each of the inquiries.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Certain states have adopted or are considering similar disclosure legislation.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency held that carbon dioxide, a GHG, may be regulated as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act, which could result in future regulations even if the U.S. Congress does not enact new legislation regarding such emissions.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have also enacted certain anti-takeover measures, including a stockholders rights plan.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters comprises approximately 12,000 square feet of leased office space, and is located at 450 Gears Road, Suite 500, Houston, Texas.
889900_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that address is (281) 765-7100.
889900_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our primary administrative office is located in Snyder, Texas and includes approximately 37,000 square feet of office and storage space.
889900_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our drilling services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Pressure Pumping Our pressure pumping services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Colorado.

889900_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	We own our administrative offices in Snyder, Texas, as well as several of our other facilities.
889900_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	We also lease a number of facilities, and we do not believe that any one of the leased facilities is individually material to our operations.
889900_11_ITEM2_P4_S2	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our needs.
889900_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business.
889900_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not believe that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

889900_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management Overview We are a leading provider of contract services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and, to a lesser extent, pressure pumping services.
889900_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition to the aforementioned contract services, we also invest, on a working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	For the three years ended December 31, 2010, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We provide our contract services to oil and natural gas operators in many of the oil and natural gas producing regions of North America.
889900_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our contract drilling operations are focused in various regions of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and western Canada, while our pressure pumping services are focused primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	The oil and natural gas properties in which we hold interests are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	During 2010, our average number of rigs operating was 168 compared to 91 in 2009 and 254 in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our average revenue per operating day was $17,670 in 2010 compared to $17,950 in 2009 and $19,380 in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	We had consolidated net income of $117 million for 2010 compared to a consolidated net loss of $38.3 million for 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	The increase in consolidated net income was primarily due to our contract drilling segment experiencing an increase in the average number of rigs operating.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	Additionally, our pressure pumping segment experienced an increase in large multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2010 compared to 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P2_S6	This increase includes the fourth quarter contribution of a pressure pumping business we acquired on October 1, 2010, which significantly expanded our pressure pumping operations into new markets in the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our contract services.
889900_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our contract services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	After reaching a peak in June 2008, there was a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices and a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced.
889900_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services, as evidenced by the decline in our monthly average number of rigs operating from a high of 283 in October 2008 to a low of 60 in June 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our monthly average number of rigs operating has subsequently increased from the mid-year low in 2009 to 196 in December 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The decline in commodity prices and deterioration in the global economy resulted in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are also highly impacted by competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We believe that our liquidity as of December 31, 2010, which includes approximately $241 million in working capital and approximately $359 million available under our $400 million revolving credit facility, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to build new equipment, make improvements to our existing equipment and pay cash dividends.
889900_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	credit facility or additional debt or equity financing.
889900_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2010, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $41.2 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.
889900_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.
889900_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2010, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had commitments to purchase approximately $267 million of major equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Trading and investing We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts.
889900_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.
889900_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Description of business We conduct our contract drilling operations in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenue earned in Canada was $65.7 million, $45.4 million and $88.5 million, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, we had long-lived assets located in Canada of $70.7 million and $69.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had 356 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Pressure pumping services are primarily well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	We also invest, on a working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, oil and natural gas properties, goodwill, revenue recognition and the use of estimates.
889900_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets in our assessment of impairment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured based on discounted cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability.
889900_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	In connection with our long term planning process, we evaluated our then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and identified four, 23 and 22 rigs, respectively, that we determined would no longer be marketed as rigs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The remaining components of these rigs were impaired and the associated net book value of $4.2 million in 2010, $10.5 million in 2009 and $10.4 million in 2008 was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In late 2008, we experienced a significant decrease in the number of our rigs operating and oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	These events were deemed by us to be triggering events that required us to perform an assessment with respect to impairment of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, in our contract drilling segment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	With respect to these long-lived assets, we estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the long-lived assets, which were comprised primarily of property and equipment, and determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	Based on this assessment, no impairment was indicated in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	Due to a continued decrease in the operating levels in our contract drilling segment through the first three quarters of 2009, we again deemed it necessary to perform an impairment assessment of long-lived assets in our contract drilling segment in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	Based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets, we determined that no impairment was indicated in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	In light of the recent favorable trends in rig utilization and revenue per operating day experienced by us and our peers, we concluded that no triggering event had occurred in 2010 with respect to our contract drilling segment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S7	We also concluded that no triggering event had occurred with respect to our pressure pumping segment in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P22_S8	Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.
889900_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_11_ITEM7_P24_S6	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in oil and natural gas prices.
889900_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future commodity prices over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on our expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $792,000, $3.7 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion and impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
889900_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	We assess impairment of our goodwill annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level of our reporting units.
889900_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Our reporting units have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.
889900_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In connection with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.
889900_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we measure any impairment of goodwill in that reporting unit by allocating the fair value to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their respective fair values.
889900_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	unallocated fair value would equal the implied fair value of goodwill, and if that amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized.
889900_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of December 31, 2008, we performed an impairment test of goodwill recorded in our contract drilling and drilling and completion fluids reporting units.
889900_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	In light of the adverse market conditions affecting our common stock price beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, including a significant decrease in the average number of our rigs operating and a significant decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices, we utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair values of our reporting units.
889900_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	In completing the first step of our analysis, we used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
889900_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	In developing these fair value estimates, we applied key assumptions, including an assumed discount rate of 13.99% for all reporting units, an assumed long-term growth rate of 3.50% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed long-term growth rate of 2.00% for the drilling and completion fluids reporting unit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2008, we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit as the estimated fair value of that reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	However, an impairment was indicated in our drilling and completion fluids reporting unit as the estimated fair value of that reporting unit was less than its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	In validating this conclusion, we considered the results of our long-lived asset impairment tests and performed sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions used in deriving the respective fair values of our reporting units.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	We then performed the second step of the analysis of our drilling and completion fluids reporting unit, which included allocating the estimated fair value to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of this reporting unit based on their respective values.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	This allocation indicated no residual value for goodwill, and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10.0 million in our December 31, 2008 statement of operations.
889900_11_ITEM7_P34_S5	We exited the drilling and completion fluids business on January 20, 2010, and the 2008 impairment charge is included in our loss from discontinued operations in our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2009 related to the $86.2 million in goodwill recorded in our contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	In completing the first step of our analysis, we used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	In developing this fair value estimate, we applied key assumptions, including an assumed discount rate of 15.42% and an assumed long-term growth rate of 3.50%.
889900_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2009, we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit as the estimated fair value of that reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In completing the first step of our analysis, we estimated our enterprise value based on our market capitalization as determined by reference to the closing price of our common stock during the fifteen days before and after year end.
889900_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	We allocated the enterprise value to our reporting units and determined that the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	As a result, we concluded that no impairment of goodwill was indicated as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit in connection with our acquisition of a pressure pumping business.
889900_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The goodwill associated with this acquisition was estimated to be $67.6 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the event that market conditions weaken, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues are recognized when services are performed, except for revenues earned under turnkey contract drilling arrangements which are recognized using the completed-contract method of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	We follow the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements.
889900_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Under the percentage-of-completion method, management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well.
889900_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and the risks therein, we follow the completed-contract method of accounting for such arrangements.
889900_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Under this method, revenues and expenses related to a well-in-progress are deferred and recognized in the period the well is completed.
889900_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process wells are made when estimated total expenses are expected to exceed total revenues.
889900_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	We recognize as revenue reimbursements received from third parties for out-of-pocket expenses and account for those out-of-pocket expenses as direct costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Except for two wells drilled under footage contacts in 2009, all of the wells we drilled in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had working capital of $241 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $27.6 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	During 2010, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	$29.4 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	During 2010, we used $238 million to acquire pressure pumping and electric wireline businesses, $30.8 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $10.8 million to pay debt issuance costs, $1.9 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and $738 million:
889900_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a working interest basis.
889900_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2010 as follows:
889900_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	On February 2, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.05 per share to be paid on March 30, 2011 to holders of record as of March 15, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our credit facilities and other factors.
889900_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	On August 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program, authorizing purchases of up to $250 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we purchased 8,743 shares of our common stock under this program at a cost of approximately $123,000.
889900_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we are authorized to purchase approximately $113 million of our outstanding common stock under this program.
889900_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	On August 19, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2010 Credit Agreement ).
889900_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The 2010 Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The 2010 Credit Agreement replaced a previous unsecured revolving credit facility.
889900_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $400 million and contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $40 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $500 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	The maturity date for the revolving credit facility is August 19, 2013.
889900_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The term loan facility provided for a loan of $100 million which was funded on August 19, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The term loan facility is payable in quarterly principal installments commencing November 19, 2010, and the installment amounts vary from 1.25% of the original principal amount for each of the first four quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal amount for each of the subsequent eight quarterly installments, 5.00% of the original principal amount for the next subsequent three quarterly installments, and the remainder due at maturity.
889900_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The maturity date for the term loan facility is August 19, 2014.
889900_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Loans under the 2010 Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate.
889900_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.75%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The commitment fee payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility varies from 0.50% to 0.75% based upon our debt to capitalization ratio and was 0.50% as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The 2010 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants.
889900_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The 2010 Credit Agreement also requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45% at any time.
889900_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The 2010 Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
889900_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The 2010 Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had $98.8 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at an interest rate of 3.125% and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
889900_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	We had $41.2 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010, and as a result, we had available borrowing capacity of approximately $359 million at that date.
889900_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Notes ) in a private placement.
889900_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to repay a $200 million borrowing on our revolving credit facility, which had been drawn to fund a portion of a business acquisition that closed on October 1, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum and were priced at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	We will pay interest on the Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year commencing on April 5, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	The Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole premium as specified in the note purchase agreement.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	We must offer to prepay the Notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S5	In addition, we must offer to prepay the Notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.
889900_11_ITEM7_P66_S6	If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid Note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.
889900_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The note purchase agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.
889900_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	The note purchase agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.
889900_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The note purchase agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio for the four prior quarters of EBITDA to interest charges for the same period.
889900_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Events of default under the note purchase agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
889900_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, if we default in payments on any Note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the Notes held by it to be immediately due and payable.
889900_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	We believe that our current level of cash, short-term investments and borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, together with cash expected to be generated from our operating activities, should be sufficient to fund our current plans to build new equipment, make improvements to our existing equipment and pay cash dividends.
889900_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	From time to time, opportunities to expand our business, including acquisitions and the building of new equipment, are evaluated.
889900_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The timing, size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable.
889900_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash generated from operations, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing.
889900_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following table presents information with respect to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):

889900_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
889900_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years has also contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	The average market price of natural gas and oil for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2010 and 2009 follows:
889900_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	The average natural gas price represents the Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly Cushing, OK WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of an increase in the number of operating days.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	The increase in operating days was due to increased demand largely caused by higher prices for natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	Our average number of rigs operating during 2009 included an average of approximately six rigs operating under term contracts that earned standby revenues of $22.3 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	Rigs on standby earn a discounted dayrate as they do not have crews and have lower costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S4	We had no significant standby revenue associated with rigs operating under term contracts in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S5	We recognized approximately $8.0 million of revenues during 2009 from the early termination of term contracts.
889900_11_ITEM7_P86_S6	We had no such revenue from the early termination of term contracts in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 primarily as a result of increased personnel costs to support increased activity levels.
889900_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Significant capital expenditures were incurred in 2010 and 2009 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade our drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	Depreciation expense increased as a result of capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	Depreciation and impairment expense includes approximately $4.2 million in 2010 and approximately $10.5 million in 2009 of impairment charges related to drilling equipment on drilling rigs that were removed from our marketable fleet.
889900_11_ITEM7_P87_S4	We removed four rigs from our marketable fleet in 2010 and removed 23 rigs from our marketable fleet in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily as a result of the increase in the number of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs, which was driven by higher demand for services associated with unconventional reservoirs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Also contributing to these increases was our acquisition of a pressure pumping business on October 1, 2010 which significantly expanded the size of our fleet of pressure pumping equipment and the markets in which we provide pressure pumping services.
889900_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our pressure pumping segment results from the date of acquisition.
889900_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	The acquired business contributed revenue of $84.7 million and operating income of $22.8 million to our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our customers have increased their activities in the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage fracturing jobs associated therewith.
889900_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	As a result, we have experienced an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fracturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.
889900_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Average revenue per other job increased as a result of increased pricing for the services provided and a change in job mix.
889900_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 include $1.5 million associated with the acquired business.
889900_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is due to additional costs necessary to support increased business activity in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Significant capital expenditures have been incurred in recent years to add capacity in our pressure pumping segment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	Depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 includes $1.0 million in amortization of intangible assets and $4.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment associated with the acquired business.
889900_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	The remaining increase in depreciation in 2010 compared to 2009 is a result of our recent capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Revenues increased due to higher average sales prices of oil and natural gas and increased oil production partially offset by a decline in natural gas production.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	Average net daily oil production increased primarily due to the addition of new wells.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Average net daily natural gas production decreased primarily due to production declines on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2010 includes approximately $792,000 of oil and natural gas property impairments compared to approximately $3.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	Depletion expense increased approximately $915,000 in 2010 compared to 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P92_S5	Capital expenditures increased in 2010 as a result of greater drilling activity and increased costs per well.
889900_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2010 primarily as a result of increased personnel costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The provision for bad debts in 2009 resulted from an increase in our reserve on specific account balances based on the deteriorating economic and credit environment at the time.
889900_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	The negative provision for bad debts in 2010 is the result of reductions in our reserve for specific accounts due to improved industry conditions.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	The gain on asset disposals in 2010 includes a gain of $20.1 million related to the sale of certain rights to explore and develop zones deeper than depths that we generally target for certain of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have working interests.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	Losses on asset disposals in 2009 were primarily related to the disposal of contract drilling equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	Acquisition-related expenses in 2010 were incurred in connection with the acquisition of pressure pumping and electric wireline businesses during the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	These expenses included certain legal and other professional fees directly related to the transaction, fees incurred in connection with the title transfers of the acquired equipment and transition costs related to information technology.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S5	Interest income increased due to the collection of interest on a customer account as well as interest received on prior overpayments of sales taxes in certain jurisdictions.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S6	Interest expense in 2010 includes $3.3 million due to the recognition of remaining deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit facility that was replaced in August 2010, and $1.3 million due to the recognition of financing costs associated with a bridge facility that expired unused on September 30, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P94_S7	The remainder of the 2010 increase relates to interest charges and the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the $100 million term loan entered into in August 2010 and the $300 million Senior Notes issued in October 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Capital expenditures increased in 2010 due to the ongoing implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.
889900_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	On January 27, 2011, we sold our electric wireline business, which had been acquired by us on October 1, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The results of operations of this business have been classified as a discontinued operation and the assets held for sale at December 31, 2010 are presented at net realizable value in the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	On January 20, 2010, we sold our drilling and completion fluids services business which had previously been presented as one of our reportable operating segments.
889900_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Due to our exit from this business, we have classified our drilling and completion fluids operating segment as a discontinued operation.
889900_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Impairment of assets held for sale in 2010 and 2009 reflects the transaction-related costs recorded to reduce the carrying value of the assets sold to their net realizable value at December 31, 2010, and 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008:
889900_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of natural gas and oil.

889900_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly Cushing, OK WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of operating days.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	The decrease in operating days was due to decreased demand largely caused by lower commodity prices for natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Our average number of rigs operating during 2009 included an average of approximately six rigs operating under term contracts that earned standby revenues of $22.3 million.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S3	This represented an increase from an average of approximately one rig operating under a term contract that earned standby revenues of $4.7 million in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S4	Rigs on standby earn a discounted dayrate as they do not have crews and have lower costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S5	We recognized approximately $8.0 million of revenues during 2009 from the early termination of drilling contracts compared to approximately $1.3 million in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S6	Average revenue per operating day decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreases in dayrates for rigs that were operating in the spot market and the expiration of term contracts that were entered into at higher rates.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S7	Average direct operating costs per operating day decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreases in labor and repair costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S8	Significant capital expenditures were incurred in 2009 and 2008 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade our drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P104_S9	Depreciation expense increased as a result of those capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	expense includes approximately $10.5 million in 2009 and approximately $10.4 million in 2008 of impairment charges related to drilling equipment on drilling rigs that were removed from our marketable fleet.
889900_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	We removed 23 rigs from our marketable fleet in 2009 and removed 22 rigs from our marketable fleet in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our customers have increased their activities in the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage fracturing jobs associated therewith.
889900_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	As a result, we have experienced an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fracturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.
889900_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	In 2009 we experienced a decrease in smaller traditional pressure pumping jobs due to depressed commodity prices, which contributed to the overall decrease in revenue and direct operating costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	In anticipation of increased activity associated with the unconventional reservoirs in the Appalachian Basin, we added facilities, equipment and personnel.
889900_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Delays in the development of these reservoirs and lower commodity prices caused a slower increase in customer activity than we had expected, negatively impacting the profitability of this business.
889900_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Significant capital expenditures have been incurred in recent years to add capacity.
889900_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Depreciation expense increased as a result of our recent capital expenditures.
889900_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Revenues decreased due to lower average sales prices and lower average net daily production of oil and natural gas.
889900_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Average net daily oil and natural gas production decreased primarily due to production declines on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	Direct operating costs decreased primarily due to decreases in seismic expenses as well as decreased production taxes and other production costs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2009 includes approximately $3.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments compared to approximately $4.4 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	primarily due to lower production and the impact of decreases in the carrying value of properties resulting from previous impairment charges.
889900_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Capital expenditures decreased in 2009 as a result of declines in commodity prices.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2009 primarily as a result of increased professional fees.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The provision for bad debts resulted from an increase in our reserve on specific account balances based on the deteriorating economic and credit environment in 2008 and 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	Losses on asset disposals in 2009 were primarily related to the disposal of contract drilling equipment.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S4	Gains on asset disposals in 2008 were primarily related to gains on the sale of contract drilling equipment and the sale of oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S5	Interest expense increased in 2009 due to the amortization of debt issuance costs and increased fees associated with outstanding letters of credit and the unused portion of the revolving credit facility that was put into place in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P112_S6	Capital expenditures increased in 2009 due to the purchase and ongoing implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.
889900_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	On January 20, 2010, we exited our drilling and completion fluids services business, which had previously been presented as one of our reportable operating segments.
889900_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Due to our exit from this business, we have classified our drilling and completion fluids operating segment as a discontinued operation.
889900_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this business, along with its results of operations, were reclassified for all periods presented.
889900_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Drilling and completion fluids revenue and direct operating costs decreased in 2009 due to decreased sales volume both on land and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Drilling and completion fluids selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs for sales and support personnel due to headcount reductions.
889900_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Goodwill impairment was recognized in the drilling and completion fluids reporting unit in 2008 as a result of our annual impairment testing which indicated that the fair value of goodwill in that reporting unit was zero.
889900_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	Impairment of assets held for sale in 2009 of $1.9 million represents the transaction-related costs recorded to reduce the carrying value of the assets sold to their net realizable value at December 31, 2009.
889900_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	income tax expense was recognized despite a pre-tax loss in the drilling and completion fluids business due to the fact that the goodwill impairment recorded in that year was not deductible for tax purposes.
889900_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The effective tax rate is a result of a Federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	For 2008, the permanent difference indicated above was largely attributable to our Domestic Production Activities Deduction.
889900_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 6% in both 2008 and 2009 and 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	The permanent differences for 2010 and 2009 reflect the recapture of a portion of this deduction due to the planned carryback of the 2010 net operating loss to prior years and the carryback of the 2009 net operating loss to prior years.
889900_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	This recapture resulted in a negative effective rate impact in 2009 due to the Company having a loss before income taxes in that year.
889900_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	We record deferred Federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets.
889900_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	We recognized deferred tax expense of approximately $147 million in 2010, $101 million in 2009 and $65.4 million in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for Federal income tax purposes.
889900_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	As a result, no deferred United States Federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $6.3 million as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Our revenue, profitability, financial condition and rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for natural gas and oil.
889900_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	Prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as international military, political and economic conditions, and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production and price targets.
889900_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	declining to an average of $5.99 per Mcf in December.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	In 2009, the monthly average market price of natural gas declined further to a low of $3.06 per Mcf in September.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	This decline in the market price of natural gas resulted in our customers significantly reducing their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009 before recovering somewhat in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S3	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last ten years has significantly contributed to excess capacity.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S4	As a result of these factors, our average number of rigs operating has declined significantly from historic highs.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S5	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_11_ITEM7_P124_S6	Low market prices for natural gas and oil would likely result in lower demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The North American land drilling industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade.
889900_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	As a result, drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.
889900_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that amends the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	This new standard removes the previously existing exception from applying consolidation guidance to qualifying special-purpose entities and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	Prior to this new standard, generally accepted accounting principles required reconsideration of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity only when specific events occurred.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	This new standard is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	This new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P127_S5	The adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	This new standard addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	Existing accounting standards require a vendor to use objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items or the residual method to separate deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	Under the new standard, it is expected that multiple-deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under current requirements.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S4	The new standard establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable for purposes of allocating revenue to multiple deliverables.
889900_11_ITEM7_P128_S5	The selling price used will be based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available.
889900_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The new standard must be prospectively applied to all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and became effective for us on January 1, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that addresses the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations.
889900_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	This update clarifies that when public entities are required to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, the pro forma information should be presented as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year when comparative financial statements are presented.
889900_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	We elected to early adopt this update and this early adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under our term credit facility or our revolving credit facility.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.75% to 3.75% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	At December 31, 2010, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $98.8 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 3.125%.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2010 would increase our annual cash interest expense by $987,500.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
889900_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
889900_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	As discussed above, we began integrating the acquired pressure pumping and wireline businesses into our existing internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter.
889900_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P0_S6	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc. and Universal Wireline, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because they were formed in 2010 to acquire certain pressure pumping and wireline businesses in a business combination during the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	We have also excluded Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc. and Universal Wireline, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc. and Universal Wireline, Inc. were wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represented 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A description of the business and basis of presentation follows:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Description of business Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as Patterson-UTI or the Company ), provides onshore contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Company provides pressure pumping services primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P10_S2	The Company also owns and invests in oil and natural gas assets as a working interest owner primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Patterson-UTI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Except for wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has no controlling financial interests in any other entity which would require consolidation.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company s operations except for its Canadian operations, which use the Canadian dollar as its functional currency.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	The effects of exchange rate changes are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P14_S0	A summary of the significant accounting policies follows:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Management estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues are recognized when services are performed, except for revenues earned under turnkey contract drilling arrangements which are recognized using the completed-contract method of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S1	The Company follows the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S2	Under the percentage-of-completion method, management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S3	Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and the risks therein, the Company follows the completed-contract method of accounting for such arrangements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S4	Under this method, all drilling revenues and expenses related to a well-in-progress are deferred and recognized in the period the well is completed.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S5	Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process wells are made when estimated total expenses are expected to exceed estimated total revenues.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P16_S6	The Company recognizes as revenue reimbursements received from third parties for out-of-pocket expenses and accounts for those out-of-pocket expenses as direct costs.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P17_S0	Except for two wells drilled under footage contracts in 2009, all of the wells the Company drilled during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were under daywork contracts.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P18_S0	Accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P19_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses existing in the Company s accounts receivable.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P19_S1	The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at least quarterly.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P19_S2	Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectibility.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P19_S3	Account balances, when determined to be uncollectible, are charged against the allowance.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P20_S0	Inventories Inventories consist primarily of sand and chemical products to be used in conjunction with the Company s pressure pumping activities.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P20_S1	The inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P21_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P21_S1	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P21_S2	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P21_S3	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P22_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P23_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P24_S6	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P25_S0	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in oil and natural gas prices.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P25_S1	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P25_S2	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P26_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P26_S1	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on management s expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P27_S0	The Company reviews unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P27_S1	The Company s impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as management s intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P27_S2	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P28_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P28_S1	The Company assesses impairment of its goodwill at least annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P29_S0	Maintenance and repairs Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P29_S1	Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing property and equipment are capitalized.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P30_S0	Disposals Upon disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P31_S0	Net income (loss) per common share The Company provides a dual presentation of its net income (loss) per common share in its consolidated statements of operations:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P31_S1	Basic net income (loss) per common share ( Basic EPS ) and diluted net income (loss) per common share ( Diluted EPS ).
889900_11_ITEM9A_P32_S0	The Company adopted a new accounting standard on January 1, 2009, which clarified that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and, as such, should be included in the calculation of earnings-per-share using the two-class method.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P32_S1	All earnings-per-share data presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 have been adjusted retrospectively to conform with this accounting standard.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P33_S0	The impact of this retrospective application to the year ended December 31, 2008 was to reduce Basic EPS and Diluted EPS by $0.01.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P34_S0	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P34_S1	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P35_S0	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P35_S1	The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using the treasury stock method.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P35_S2	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P36_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate income (loss) from continuing operations per share, loss from discontinued operations per share and net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands, except per share amounts):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P37_S0	Income taxes The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P37_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P37_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P37_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P37_S4	If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P38_S0	The Company s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P39_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P39_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P39_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 11).
889900_11_ITEM9A_P40_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that amends the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S1	This new standard removes the previously existing exception from applying consolidation guidance to qualifying special-purpose entities and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S2	Prior to this new standard, generally accepted accounting principles required reconsideration of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity only when specific events occurred.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S3	This new standard is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S4	This new standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P41_S5	The adoption of this standard did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P42_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P42_S1	This new standard addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P43_S0	and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items or the residual method to separate deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P43_S1	Under the new standard, it is expected that multiple-deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under current requirements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P43_S2	The new standard establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable for purposes of allocating revenue to multiple deliverables.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P43_S3	The selling price used will be based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P44_S0	The new standard must be prospectively applied to all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and became effective for the Company on January 1, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P44_S1	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P45_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that addresses the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P45_S1	This update clarifies that when public entities are required to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, the pro forma information should be presented as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year when comparative financial statements are presented.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P45_S2	This update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P45_S3	The Company elected to early adopt this update and this early adoption did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P46_S0	Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements in order for them to conform with the 2010 presentation.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P46_S1	These reclassifications had no significant impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P47_S0	On January 27, 2011, the stock of the Company s electric wireline subsidiary, Universal Wireline, Inc., was sold in a cash transaction for $25.5 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P47_S1	Except for inventory, the working capital of Universal Wireline, Inc. was excluded from the sale and retained by a subsidiary of the Company.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P48_S0	Universal Wireline, Inc. was formed in 2010 to acquire the electric wireline business of Key Energy Services, Inc., as discussed in Note 3.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P48_S1	The results of operations of this business have been presented as results of discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P48_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the assets to be disposed of were classified as held for sale and are presented separately within current assets under the caption Assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P48_S3	Upon being classified as held for sale, the assets to be disposed of were recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell resulting in a charge of $2.2 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P48_S4	Due to the fact that the carrying value of the assets had been adjusted to net realizable value, no significant additional gain or loss was recognized in connection with the sale.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P49_S0	On January 20, 2010, the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids business, which had previously been presented as one of the Company s reportable operating segments.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P49_S1	On that date, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Ambar Lone Star Fluids Services LLC, completed the sale of substantially all of its assets, excluding billed accounts receivable.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P49_S2	The sales price was approximately $42.6 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P50_S0	Upon the Company s exit from the drilling and completion fluids business, the Company classified its drilling and completion fluids operating segment as a discontinued operation.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P50_S1	Accordingly, the results of operations of this business have been reclassified and presented as results of discontinued operations for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2009, the assets to be disposed of were considered held for sale and were presented separately within current assets under the caption Assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P50_S3	Upon being classified as held for sale, the assets to be disposed of were adjusted to fair value less estimated costs to sell resulting in an impairment loss of $1.9 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P50_S4	Due to the fact that the carrying value of the assets had been adjusted to net realizable value, no significant additional gain or loss was recognized in connection with the sale in 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P51_S0	Summarized operating results from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are shown below (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P52_S0	The loss before income taxes in 2008 includes approximately $10.0 million in non-deductible charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P52_S1	As a result, income tax expense was incurred for the year despite the fact that the discontinued operation had a pre-tax book loss.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P53_S0	The components of assets held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown below (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S0	On October 1, 2010, two subsidiaries of the Company, Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc. and Universal Wireline, Inc., completed the acquisition of certain assets from Key Energy Pressure Pumping Services, LLC and Key Electric Wireline Services, LLC relating to the businesses of providing pressure pumping services and electric wireline services to participants in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S1	This acquisition expanded the Company s pressure pumping operations to additional markets primarily in Texas.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S2	The aggregate purchase price was $241 million consisting of a cash payment of $238 million at closing funded through a combination of cash on hand and a $200 million draw on the Company s revolving credit facility, a subsequent cash payment based on the value of closing inventory of approximately $1.2 million to be made in the first quarter of 2011 and the assumption of liabilities of approximately $2.1 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S3	The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S4	The tangible assets acquired include property and equipment, inventories of sand and chemicals on hand and repair and maintenance supplies on hand.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S5	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include an agreement by the seller to not compete for a period of three years and the customer relationships in place at the time of the acquisition.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S6	The liabilities assumed arose from pricing agreements in place with certain customers that had pricing below current market rates.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P54_S7	A related deferred tax asset was recognized to reflect the temporary difference associated with these below-market pricing arrangements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P55_S0	tax asset, net of the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill and was attributed to the pressure pumping business acquired.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P55_S1	A summary of the purchase price allocation follows (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P56_S0	In addition to the purchase price, acquisition-related expenses associated with this transaction of approximately $2.5 million were incurred by the Company and are presented in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption acquisition-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P56_S1	These expenses include certain legal and other professional fees directly related to the transaction, fees incurred in connection with title transfers of the acquired equipment and transition costs related to information technology.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P57_S0	As discussed in Note 2, the electric wireline business was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010 and was subsequently sold on January 27, 2011.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P57_S1	The results of operations of the wireline business from the date of acquisition included revenue of $5.7 million and a pre-tax operating loss of $1.5 million (including a charge of approximately $2.2 million incurred to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to its net realizable value) which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P57_S2	Results of operations of the acquired pressure pumping business are included in the Company s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P57_S3	Revenues of $84.7 million and income from operations of $22.8 million from the acquired pressure pumping business are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P58_S0	The following represents pro-forma unaudited financial information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2009 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

889900_11_ITEM9A_P60_S0	The following table summarizes depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense related to property and equipment and intangible assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P61_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P61_S1	In light of adverse market conditions affecting the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, including a substantial decrease in the operating levels of certain of its business segments and a significant decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices, the Company deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within its contract drilling segment in 2008.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P61_S2	Due to a continued decrease in the operating levels within its contract drilling business segment through the first three quarters of 2009, the Company again deemed it necessary to perform an impairment assessment of long-lived assets in its contract drilling segment in 2009.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P61_S3	In light of the recent favorable trends in rig utilization and revenue per operating day experienced by the Company and its peers, management concluded that no triggering event had occurred in 2010 with respect to its contract drilling segment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P62_S0	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets at the end of each quarter due to revisions in its oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P62_S1	The Company concluded that its pressure pumping segment was not subject to the negative events and trends to the same degree as the contract drilling segment, and thus did not require further assessment of recoverability in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P63_S0	The Company performs the first step of its impairment assessments by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each long-lived asset or asset group to its respective carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P63_S1	Based on the results of these impairment tests, the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in the contract drilling and oil and natural gas segments were determined to be recoverable, except as described below.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P64_S0	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P64_S1	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P64_S2	The Company recorded impairment charges of $792,000, $3.7 million and $4.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to its oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P64_S3	The Company determined the fair value of the impaired assets using internally developed unobservable inputs including future pricing and reserves (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_11_ITEM9A_P65_S0	would no longer be marketed as rigs.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P65_S1	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P65_S2	The remaining components of these rigs were impaired and the associated net book value of $4.2 million in 2010, $10.5 million in 2009 and $10.4 million in 2008 was expensed in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P65_S3	The impaired components were estimated to have no fair value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P66_S0	During 2010, the Company sold certain rights to explore and develop zones deeper than depths that it generally targets for certain of the oil and natural gas properties in which it has working interests.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P66_S1	The proceeds from this sale were approximately $22.3 million and the sale resulted in a gain on disposal of $20.1 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P67_S0	Goodwill Goodwill by operating segment as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and changes for the years then ended are as follows (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P68_S0	Goodwill recorded in connection with a business combination in 2010 was a result of the Company s acquisition of the pressure pumping business of Key Energy Services, Inc. on October 1, 2010, as discussed further in Note 3.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P68_S1	Approximately $53.2 million of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P69_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually on December 31 to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P69_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P69_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P70_S0	The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2009 related to the $86.2 million in goodwill recorded in its contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P70_S1	In completing its first step of the analysis, the Company used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P70_S2	In developing this fair value estimate, the Company applied key assumptions, including an assumed discount rate of 15.42% and an assumed long-term growth rate of 3.50%.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P71_S0	on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2009, the Company concluded that no impairment was indicated in its contract drilling reporting unit as the estimated fair value of that reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P72_S0	The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P73_S0	In completing its first step of the analysis, the Company estimated its enterprise value based on the market capitalization of the Company as determined by reference to the closing price of the Company s common stock during the fifteen days before and after year end.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P73_S1	The enterprise value was allocated to the Company s reporting units and it was determined that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were in excess of their carrying value.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P73_S2	As a result, the Company concluded that no impairment of goodwill was indicated as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P74_S0	In the event that market conditions weaken, the Company may determine additional impairments of goodwill in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P75_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of the pressure pumping business discussed in Note 3.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P75_S1	As a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded intangible assets related to a non-compete agreement and the customer relationships acquired.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P75_S2	These intangible assets were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P76_S0	The non-compete agreement has a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P76_S1	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P77_S0	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P77_S1	Amortization expense of $116,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with the non-compete agreement.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P78_S0	The value of the customer relationships was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model to determine the present value of the projected cash flows associated with the customers in place at the time of the acquisition and taking into account a contributory asset charge.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P78_S1	The resulting intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P78_S2	Amortization expense of $910,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with customer relationships.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P79_S0	The following table sets forth the activity with respect to intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands):

889900_11_ITEM9A_P81_S1	The deferred revenue relates to out-of-market pricing agreements that were in place at the acquired business at the time of the acquisition.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P81_S2	The deferred revenue will be recognized as pressure pumping revenue over the remaining term of the pricing agreements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P81_S3	Deferred revenue of approximately $6.1 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to these pricing agreements.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P82_S0	The Company records a liability for the estimated costs to be incurred in connection with the abandonment of oil and natural gas properties in the future.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P82_S1	This liability is included in the caption other in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P82_S2	The following table describes the changes to the Company s asset retirement obligations during 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):

889900_11_ITEM9A_P141_S2	Because the 2009 Performance Units are to be settled in cash at the end of the performance period, they are accounted for as liability awards and the Company s pro-rated obligation is measured at estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P141_S3	As of December 31, 2010 this pro-rated obligation was approximately $2.3 million and is included in the caption other in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P141_S4	Compensation expense associated with the 2009 Performance Units was approximately $1.5 million and $859,000 for the years ended December 31,2010 and 2009, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P142_S0	On April 27, 2010, the Company granted stock-settled performance unit awards to certain executive officers (the 2010 Performance Units ).
889900_11_ITEM9A_P142_S1	The 2010 Performance Units provide for those executive officers to receive a grant of shares of stock upon the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Company during a specified period.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P142_S2	The performance period for the 2010 Performance Units is the period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2013, but can extend through March 31, 2015 in certain circumstances.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P142_S3	The performance goals for the 2010 Performance Units are tied to the Company s total shareholder return for the performance period as compared to total shareholder return for a peer group determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P142_S4	These goals are considered to be market conditions under the relevant accounting standards and the market conditions are factored into the determination of the fair value of the performance units.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S0	Generally, the recipients will receive a base number of shares if the Company s total shareholder return is positive and, when compared to the peer group, is at or above the 25th percentile but less than the 50th percentile, two times the base if at or above the 50th percentile but less than the 75th percentile, and four times the base if at the 75th percentile or higher.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S1	The grant of shares when achievement is between the 25th and 75th percentile will be determined on a pro-rata basis.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S2	The total base number of shares with respect to the 2010 Performance Units is 89,375 shares.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S3	Because the 2010 Performance Units are stock-settled awards, they are accounted for as equity awards and measured at fair value on the date of grant.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S4	The fair value of the 2010 Performance Units as of the date of grant was approximately $3.1 million using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S5	This amount will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P143_S6	Compensation expense associated with the 2010 Performance Units was approximately $779,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P144_S0	Dividends on Equity Awards Non-forfeitable cash dividends and dividend equivalents paid on equity awards are recognized as follows:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P145_S0	Dividends are recognized as reductions of retained earnings for the portion of restricted stock awards expected to vest.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P146_S0	Dividends are recognized as additional compensation cost for the portion of restricted stock awards that are not expected to vest or that ultimately do not vest.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P147_S0	Dividend equivalents are recognized as additional compensation cost for restricted stock units.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P148_S0	The Company incurred rent expense of $18.1 million, $11.9 million and $31.5 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P148_S1	Rent expense is primarily related to short-term equipment rentals that are generally passed through to customers.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P149_S0	The Company s obligations under non-cancelable operating lease agreements are not material to its operations or cash flows.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P150_S0	Components of the income tax provision applicable to Federal, state and foreign income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P151_S0	The difference between the statutory Federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows:
889900_11_ITEM9A_P152_S0	For 2008, the permanent difference indicated above was largely attributable to the Company s Domestic Production Activities Deduction.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P152_S1	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,) and allows a deduction of 6% in both 2008 and 2009 and 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P152_S2	The permanent differences for 2010 and 2009 reflect the recapture of a portion of this deduction due to the planned carryback of the 2010 net operating loss to prior years and the carryback of the 2009 net operating loss to prior years.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P152_S3	This recapture resulted in a negative effective rate impact in 2009 due to the Company having a loss before income taxes in that year.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P153_S0	The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes therein were as follows (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P154_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P154_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P154_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P154_S3	The Company expects the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities and the generation of taxable income; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P155_S0	Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of various allowance accounts and tax-deferred expenses expected to generate future tax benefit of approximately $35 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P155_S1	Other deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of the tax effect of receivables from insurance companies and tax-deferred income not yet recognized for tax purposes.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P156_S0	For income tax purposes, the Company generated approximately $221 million of Federal net operating losses and approximately $71.3 million of state net operating losses during the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P157_S0	Net operating losses that can be carried forward, if unused, are scheduled to expire as follows: 2014 $9 million; 2015 $5 million; 2019 $12 million; 2029 $57 million and 2030 - $18 million.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P158_S1	The Company has established a policy to account for interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as operating expenses.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P158_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the tax years ended December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2009 are open for examination by U.S. taxing authorities.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P158_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the tax years ended December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2009 are open for examination by Canadian taxing authorities.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P159_S0	On January 1, 2010, the Company converted its Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for Federal income tax purposes.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P159_S1	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P160_S0	As a result of the above conversion, the Company s Canadian assets are no longer subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P160_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company has elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intends to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P160_S2	As a result, no deferred United States Federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $6.3 million as of December 31, 2010.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P161_S0	The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for all eligible employees.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P161_S1	The Company s operating results include expenses of approximately $3.1 million in 2010, $2.8 million in 2009 and $4.5 million in 2008 for the Company s cash contributions to the plan.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P162_S0	The Company s revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three business segments: (i) contract drilling of oil and natural gas wells, (ii) pressure pumping services and (iii) the investment, on a working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P162_S1	Each of these segments represents a distinct type of business.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P162_S2	These segments have separate management teams which report to the Company s chief operating decision maker.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P162_S3	The results of operations in these segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P163_S0	As discussed in Note 2, in January 2010 the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids services business which previously was reported as a business segment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P163_S1	Operating results for that business for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P163_S2	Also included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 are the operating results for an electric wireline business that was acquired on October 1, 2010 and sold in January 2011.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P164_S0	Contract Drilling The Company markets its contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P164_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 356 marketable land-based drilling rigs, of which 73 of the drilling rigs were based in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico; 97 in north central and east Texas, northern Louisiana and Mississippi; 58 in the Rocky Mountain region (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota); 51 in south Texas and southern Louisiana; 32 in the Texas panhandle, Oklahoma and Arkansas; 25 in the Appalachian Basin and 20 in western Canada.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P165_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, contract drilling revenue earned in Canada was $65.7 million, $45.4 million and $88.5 million, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P165_S1	Additionally, long-lived assets within the contract drilling segment located in Canada totalled $70.7 million and $69.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P166_S0	Pressure Pumping The Company provides pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P166_S1	Pressure pumping services are primarily well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P167_S0	Well stimulation involves processes inside a well designed to enhance the flow of oil, natural gas, or other desired substances from the well.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P168_S0	Cementing is the process of inserting material between the hole and the pipe to center and stabilize the pipe in the hole.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P169_S0	The Company owns and invests in oil and natural gas assets as a working interest owner.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P169_S1	The Company s oil and natural gas interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P170_S0	The following tables summarize selected financial information relating to the Company s business segments (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P171_S0	Includes contract drilling intercompany revenues related to drilling services provided to the oil and natural gas exploration and production segment.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P172_S0	Net gains or losses associated with the disposal of assets relate to corporate strategy decisions of the executive management group.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P172_S1	Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been separately presented and excluded from the results of specific segments.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P173_S0	Corporate and other assets primarily include identifiable assets associated with assets held for sale as well as cash on hand, income taxes receivable and certain deferred Federal income tax assets.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P174_S0	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of demand deposits, temporary cash investments and trade receivables.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P175_S0	The Company believes it has placed its demand deposits and temporary cash investments with high credit-quality financial institutions.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P175_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company s demand deposits and temporary cash investments consisted of the following (in thousands):
889900_11_ITEM9A_P176_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are primarily focused on companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P176_S1	The concentration is somewhat mitigated by the diversification of customers for which the Company provides services.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P176_S2	As is general industry practice, the Company typically does not require customers to provide collateral.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P176_S3	No significant losses from individual customers were experienced during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.

889900_11_ITEM9A_P177_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P177_S1	The carrying value of the balance outstanding under the term loan facility at December 31, 2010 approximates fair value as it has a floating interest rate that adjusts at each quarterly interest payment date.
889900_11_ITEM9A_P177_S2	The fair value of the 4.97% Series A Senior Notes at December 31, 2010 was approximately $290 million.

889900_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	The SEC maintains an internet site ( www.sec.gov ) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
889900_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We own and operate one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs in the United States.
889900_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company was formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our contract drilling business operates primarily in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and western Canada.
889900_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 328 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	A drilling rig is considered marketable at a point in time if it is operating or can be made ready to operate without significant capital expenditures.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S5	We also own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S6	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S7	Prior to January 20, 2010, we provided drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and on land in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S8	We sold our drilling and completion fluids services business on January 20, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S9	On October 1, 2010, we acquired the assets and operations of a pressure pumping business and an electric wireline business.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S10	The electric wireline business that we acquired was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010 and sold on January 27, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM1_P5_S11	The results of our drilling and completion fluids services business and our electric wireline business are presented as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
889900_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	oil and natural gas exploration and production.
889900_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	All of our industry segments had operating profits in 2011 and 2010.
889900_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2009, our pressure pumping services and oil and natural gas exploration and production segments had operating profits and our contract drilling services segment had an operating loss.
889900_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had 328 marketable land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	34 in the Appalachian Basin, and Our marketable drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 5,250 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Of these drilling rigs, 145 are electric rigs and 183 are mechanical rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the diesel power (the sole energy source for a mechanical rig) into electricity to power the rig.
889900_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as replacement parts for marketable rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs to ensure that our drilling equipment is competitive.
889900_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We have spent over $1.8 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling fleet.
889900_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we spent approximately $785 million, $656 million and $395 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently one to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	During 2011, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 22 days.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_12_ITEM1_P15_S6	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for the payment of an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that our drilling contracts generally provide for identification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions or other factors.
889900_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork, footage or turnkey basis, or a combination thereof.
889900_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	In each case, we provide the rig and crews.
889900_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our bid for each job depends upon location, depth and anticipated complexity of the well, on-site drilling conditions, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed well.
889900_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	The customer supervises the drilling of the well.
889900_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Except for two wells drilled under footage contracts in 2009, all of the wells we drilled in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were under daywork contracts.
889900_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Under footage contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot.
889900_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	The customer provides drilling fluids, casing, cementing and well design expertise.
889900_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	These contracts require us to bear the cost of services and supplies that we provide until the well has been drilled to the agreed-upon depth.
889900_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	If we drill the well in less time than estimated, we have the opportunity to improve our profits over those that would be attainable under a daywork contract.
889900_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	Profits are reduced and losses may be incurred if the well requires more days to drill to the contracted depth than estimated.
889900_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Footage contracts generally contain greater risks for a drilling contractor than daywork contracts.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Under footage contracts, the drilling contractor typically assumes certain risks associated with loss of the well from fire, blowouts and other risks.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	We drilled two wells under footage contracts in 2009, and we did not drill any wells under footage contracts in 2011 or 2010.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Under turnkey contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed fee.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	In a turnkey arrangement, we are required to bear the costs of services, supplies and equipment beyond those typically provided under a footage contract.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	In addition to the drilling rig and crew, we are required to provide the drilling and completion fluids, casing, cementing, and the technical well design and engineering services during the drilling process.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S5	We also typically assume certain risks associated with drilling the well such as fires, blowouts, cratering of the well bore and other such risks.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S6	Compensation occurs only when the agreed-upon scope of the work has been completed, which requires us to make larger up-front working capital commitments prior to receiving payments under a turnkey drilling contract.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S7	Under a turnkey contract, we have the opportunity to improve our profits if the drilling process goes as expected and there are no complications or time delays.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S8	Given the increased exposure we have under a turnkey contract, however, profits can be significantly reduced and losses can be incurred if complications or delays occur during the drilling process.
889900_12_ITEM1_P21_S9	Turnkey contracts generally involve the highest degree of risk among the three different types of drilling contracts.
889900_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Although we have entered into turnkey contracts in the past, we did not enter into any turnkey contracts in the past three years.
889900_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	(1) A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	While conventional wells remain an important source of natural gas and oil, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for natural gas and oil in North America.
889900_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	To address our customers needs for drilling wells in the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	APEX 1500 rigs are 1,500 horsepower electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other highly automated pipe handling equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	APEX 1000 rigs are 1,000 horsepower electric rigs with advanced technology equipment similar to the APEX 1500 rigs, but with a more compact design to fit on smaller locations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	APEX Walking rigs are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2011 our drilling fleet was comprised of the following:
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We estimate the depth capacity with respect to our marketable rigs as of December 31, 2011 to be as follows: At December 31, 2011, we owned and operated 326 trucks and 403 trailers used to rig down, transport and rig up our drilling rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our ownership of trucks and trailers reduces our dependency upon third parties for these services and generally enhances the efficiency of our contract drilling operations in periods of high drilling rig utilization.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	We perform repair and overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (Southwest Region) and the Appalachian Basin (Northeast Region).
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S5	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S6	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_12_ITEM1_P28_S7	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe that our pressure pumping contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each pressure pumping contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions or other factors.
889900_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrogen fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 631,000 hydraulic horsepower as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2011 included:
889900_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements, that do not cover all of our required supply and that sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for continued provision of any particular material or should one of our suppliers fail to deliver or timely deliver our materials.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Interests We own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in producing regions of Texas and New Mexico.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted less than 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	The customers of each of our contract drilling and pressure pumping business segments are oil and natural gas operators.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	Our customer base includes both major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	During 2011, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Competition Our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand.
889900_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	The adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	Federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	Any suspension or moratorium of the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_12_ITEM1_P40_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into waters from facilities.
889900_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
889900_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shales.
889900_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Result in Operational Delays.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	In Canada, a variety of Canadian federal, provincial and municipal laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	These laws and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S5	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_12_ITEM1_P49_S6	For example, in July 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) published proposed New Source Performance Standards ( NSPS ) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAP ) that would impose, among other things, new standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Stringent Environmental Laws and Regulations That May Expose Us to Significant Costs and Liabilities, and Future Regulations May Be More Stringent.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S5	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S6	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S7	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S8	Our operations could also cause significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S9	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S10	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S11	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain contractual rights to indemnity from our customer for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S12	Our contractual right to indemnification, however, may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S13	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S14	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S15	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S16	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary for our businesses, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S17	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S18	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S19	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S20	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S21	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S22	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S23	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S24	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S25	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_12_ITEM1_P50_S26	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	We had approximately 8,200 full-time employees at December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S6	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S7	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S8	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S9	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations, however the winter weather in the Appalachian Basin has recently resulted in slower activity for our pressure pumping operations.
889900_12_ITEM1_P51_S10	In addition, our drilling operations in Canada and, to a lesser extent, our pressure pumping operations in the Appalachian Basin, are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual Spring thaw.
889900_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009, there was a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Furthermore, these factors resulted in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although the significant deterioration in the global economic environment appeared to stabilize to some degree during 2010 and 2011, there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	A return of the conditions causing a deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Prices are affected by factors such as:
889900_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	During the second quarter of 2008, the quarterly average market price of natural gas (Henry Hub spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $11.74 per Mcf and the quarterly average market price of oil (WTI spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $123.95 per barrel.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In the last half of 2008, commodity prices rapidly declined and averaged $6.60 per Mcf for natural gas and $58.35 per barrel for oil in the fourth quarter of 2008.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In 2009, the price of natural gas declined further and averaged $4.06 per Mcf for the year.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Oil prices remained depressed during 2009 as well and averaged $61.65 per barrel for the year.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	These declines in the market price of natural gas and oil resulted in our customers significantly reducing their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Drilling activities increased in 2010 as did the prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S6	The increased drilling activity was largely attributed to increased development of unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil which averaged $79.40 per barrel in 2010.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Drilling for oil and liquids rich targets continued to increase in 2011 as oil averaged $94.86 per barrel for the year.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Natural gas prices decreased in 2011 to an average of $4.00 per Mcf.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S9	The 2011 decrease in natural gas prices was most significant in the fourth quarter where the average price dropped to $3.32 per Mcf and this decrease has continued into 2012 where natural gas prices fell below $3.00 per Mcf in January.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S10	The increase in drilling activity in oil rich basins has absorbed the decrease in demand for natural gas drilling activities in 2011 and our rig count increased in both 2010 and 2011.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last ten years has significantly contributed to excess capacity.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined from historic highs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	pumping services and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:
889900_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	construction of new technology drilling rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Construction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and we believe there has been, and we expect there to continue to be, a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The addition of new pressure pumping equipment, as well as any general decline in demand for pressure pumping services, could result in there being substantially more pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If this were to occur, providers of pressure pumping services will have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Shortages of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Fixed Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Fixed term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	However, in certain limited circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a sustained breach of our contract obligations, no early termination payment may be paid to us.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The failure to receive an early termination payment under a number of our fixed-term contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	The Oil Service Business Segments in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	At times, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The fact that drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In recent years, many drilling and pressure pumping companies have consolidated or merged with other companies.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although this consolidation has decreased the total number of competitors, we believe the competition for drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be intense.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Labor Shortages and Rising Labor Costs Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	During periods of increasing demand for contract drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry experiences shortages of qualified personnel.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	During these periods, our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to market and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment is adversely affected, which negatively impacts both our operations and profitability.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Operationally, it is more difficult to hire qualified personnel, which adversely affects our ability to mobilize inactive rigs and pressure pumping equipment in response to the increased demand for such services.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Additionally, wage rates for drilling and pressure pumping personnel are likely to increase during periods of increasing demand, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In 2011, we received approximately 41 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest customers (including their affiliates).
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Although no single customer accounted for more than seven percent of our consolidated operating revenue in 2011, the loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The land drilling and pressure pumping industries have experienced significant consolidation, and there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S7	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Our operations could also cause significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S9	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S10	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S11	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain contractual rights to indemnity from our customers for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Our contractual right to indemnification, however, may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S13	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet their contractual indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S14	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S15	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S16	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S17	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S18	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S19	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S20	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P22_S21	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We Are Dependent Upon our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under our Long Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under a term loan and revolving credit facility as well as our senior notes.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.75% to 3.75% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	At December 31, 2011, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we had $110 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 4.05% and $92.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 3.25%.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving and term credit facilities as of December 31, 2011 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $2.0 million.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	New Technologies May Cause Our Drilling and Pressure Pumping Processes and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, Resulting in an Adverse Effect on our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Changes in technology or improvements in competitors processes and equipment could make our processes and equipment less competitive or require significant capital expenditures to keep our processes and equipment competitive.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any such changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Environmental Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P26_S6	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to substantial civil and criminal penalties.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	For example, in July 2011, the EPA issued proposed rules under the NSPS and NESHAP programs that would, among other things, impose new standards for flowback operations during completions at new, hydraulically fractured or re-fractured natural gas wells.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	These proposed rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Result in Operational Delays.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Both the EPA and the U.S. Congress are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing activities and soil or ground water contamination.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S8	As part of their respective studies, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and the EPA each sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S9	We have responded to each of the inquiries.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S10	In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S11	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S12	Certain states where we operate, including Texas, have adopted or are considering similar disclosure legislation.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S13	For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P28_S14	In addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act s Underground Injection Control Program and has begun the process of drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, including the White House Council on Environmental Quality and a committee of the United States House of Representatives.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, a number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act, including one regulation that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large sources.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, the EPA published rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, which has been amended to include certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S8	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S10	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S11	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S12	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_12_ITEM1A_P31_S13	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.

889900_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included as Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report.
889900_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	Due to the sale of our drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010 and the sale of our electric wireline business in January 2011, the results of operations for those businesses have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management Overview We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition to the aforementioned services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prior to the sale of substantially all of the assets of our drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010, we provided drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	Due to our exit from the drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010, we have presented the results of that business as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	We acquired an electric wireline business on October 1, 2010 and sold the business on January 27, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	Due to our exit from the electric wireline business, we have presented the results of that business as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 328 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Although there continued to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment and fluctuation of commodity prices, activity in our drilling business continued to increase during 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2011, our average number of rigs operating increased to 232 including 220 in the United States and 12 in Canada, as compared to an average of 194 drilling rigs operating, including 182 rigs in the United States and 12 rigs in Canada during the same period in 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	While conventional wells remain an important source of natural gas and oil, this increased activity results, in part, from our addressing our customers needs for drilling wells in the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we have completed 91 new APEX rigs and made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	We expect to complete an additional 30 new APEX rigs in 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	In connection with the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we see a continued need for equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we have also added over 467,000 hydraulic horsepower to our pressure pumping fleet since the end of 2009, and we had a total of approximately 631,000 hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet at the end of 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Though the beginning of 2012 has seen unusually low natural gas prices, high oil prices are expected to increase drilling and pressure pumping activity in the oil and liquids rich areas.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under long-term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of one year or more.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our backlog as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $1.6 billion.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We expect approximately $898 million of our backlog to be realized in 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	We calculate our backlog by multiplying the day rate under our long-term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	In addition, generally our long-term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for the payment of an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_12_ITEM7_P4_S6	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Fixed Term Contracts May in Certain Instances be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	For the three years ended December 31, 2011, our operating revenues from continuing operations consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	During 2011, our average number of rigs operating was 216 compared to 168 in 2010 and 91 in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our average revenue per operating day was $21,200 in 2011 compared to $17,670 in 2010 and $17,950 in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Additionally, our pressure pumping segment experienced an increase in large multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	This increase includes the contribution of a pressure pumping business we acquired on October 1, 2010, which significantly expanded our pressure pumping operations into new markets in the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	We had consolidated net income of $322 million for 2011 compared to $117 million for 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S6	The increase in consolidated net income was primarily due to our contract drilling segment experiencing an increase in the average number of rigs operating and an increase in the average revenue per operating day as well as greater activity, pricing and size of our pressure pumping business.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S7	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S8	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_12_ITEM7_P6_S9	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	After reaching a peak in June 2008, there was a significant extended decline in oil and natural gas prices and a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services, as evidenced by the decline in our monthly average number of rigs operating from a high of 283 in October 2008 to a low of 60 in June 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our monthly average number of rigs operating has subsequently increased from the mid-year low of 60 in 2009 to 233 in December 2011 and our profitability has improved.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties,.
889900_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured based on discounted cash flows.
889900_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In connection with our ongoing planning process, we evaluated our then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2011, 2010 and 2009 and identified 53, four and 23 rigs, during each of those years respectively, that we determined were impaired and would no longer be marketed as rigs based on our assessment of estimated expenditures to bring these rigs into condition to operate in the current environment, as well as our assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The fair value of the remaining components of these rigs was estimated to be zero as there was no future cash flow expected and the associated net book value of $15.7 million in 2011, $4.2 million in 2010 and $10.5 million in 2009 was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	In late 2008, oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly, and we experienced a significant decrease in the number of our rigs operating.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	A continued decrease in the operating levels in our contract drilling segment through the first half of 2009 was deemed by us to be a triggering event that required us to perform an assessment with respect to impairment of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, in our contract drilling segment in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	With respect to these long-lived assets, we estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the long-lived assets, which were comprised primarily of drilling rigs and related equipment (excluding the rigs which had been removed from our marketable fleet), and determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets at that time.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	Based on this assessment, no further impairment was indicated in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	In light of the favorable trends in rig utilization and revenue per operating day experienced by us and our peers in 2010 and 2011, we concluded that no triggering events occurred in 2010 or 2011 with respect to our contract drilling segment as a whole which would indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in that segment may not be recoverable (excluding the rigs which had been removed from our marketable fleet).
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	We concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to our pressure pumping segment in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	We assess impairment of our goodwill annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level of our reporting units.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our reporting units have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	We currently have goodwill in our contract drilling and pressure pumping operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	In connection with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of December 31, 2010, we first compared the fair value of the reporting units with their carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	In completing this first step of our analysis, we estimated our enterprise value based on our market capitalization as determined by reference to the closing price of our common stock during the fifteen days before and after year end.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S7	We allocated this enterprise value to our reporting units and determined that the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S8	The fair value of our reporting units as of December 31, 2010 exceeded the carrying value in all cases such that no impairment was indicated.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S9	If the carrying value had exceeded the fair value, we would have measured any impairment of goodwill in that reporting unit by allocating the fair value to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their respective fair values.
889900_12_ITEM7_P17_S10	Any excess unallocated fair value would equal the implied fair value of goodwill, and if that amount was below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge would have been recognized.
889900_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update which provides entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	performing the two-step impairment test described above is unnecessary.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The provisions of this accounting standards update are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, however, early adoption is permitted.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	We elected to adopt the provisions of the new goodwill impairment accounting standard issued in September 2011 in connection with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of December 31, 2011 and determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amount and further testing was not necessary.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	In making our determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2011 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	We also considered the level of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence our overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	Additionally, current year operating results and forecasted operating results for the coming year were also taken into account.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from our 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S7	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that may result from recent decreases in natural gas prices.
889900_12_ITEM7_P19_S8	In the event that market conditions weaken, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We follow the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Under the percentage-of-completion method, management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and the risks therein, we follow the completed-contract method of accounting for such arrangements.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	Under this method, revenues and expenses related to a well-in-progress are deferred and recognized in the period the well is completed.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process wells are made when estimated total expenses are expected to exceed total revenues.
889900_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	We recognize as revenue reimbursements received from third parties for out-of-pocket expenses and account for those out-of-pocket expenses as direct costs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Except for two wells drilled under footage contacts in 2009, all of the wells we drilled in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in oil and natural gas prices.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future commodity prices over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on our expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $3.0 million, $792,000 and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $346 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million, compared to working capital of $241 million and cash and cash equivalents of $27.6 million at December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	During 2011, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	$22.5 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	During 2011, we used $31.0 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $4.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, $6.3 million to repay long-term debt and $1.0 billion:
889900_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a working interest basis.
889900_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2011 as follows:
889900_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On February 1, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.05 per share to be paid on March 30, 2012 to holders of record as of March 15, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our credit facilities and other factors.
889900_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program, authorizing purchases of up to $250 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased 8,689 shares of our common stock under this program at a cost of approximately $255,000.
889900_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we are authorized to purchase approximately $113 million of our outstanding common stock under this program.
889900_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	On August 19, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ).
889900_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $400 million and contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $40 million.
889900_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $500 million.
889900_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	The maturity date for the revolving credit facility is August 19, 2013.
889900_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The term loan facility provided for a loan of $100 million which was funded on August 19, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The term loan facility is payable in quarterly principal installments commencing November 19, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The installment amounts vary from 1.25% of the original principal amount for each of the first four quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal amount for each of the subsequent eight quarterly installments, 5.00% of the original principal amount for the next subsequent three quarterly installments, with the remainder becoming due at maturity.
889900_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	The maturity date for the term loan facility is August 19, 2014.
889900_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate.
889900_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.75%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.
889900_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The commitment fee payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility varies from 0.50% to 0.75% based upon our debt to capitalization ratio and was 0.50% as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants.
889900_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45% at any time.
889900_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
889900_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had $92.5 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at an interest rate of 3.25% and had $110 million principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.05%.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We had $40.6 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2011, and as a result, we had available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of approximately $249 million at that date.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Notes ) in a private placement.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	We pay interest on the Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	The Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S6	The Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole premium as specified in the note purchase agreement.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S7	We must offer to prepay the Notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S8	In addition, we must offer to prepay the Notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.
889900_12_ITEM7_P45_S9	If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid Note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.
889900_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The note purchase agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.
889900_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The note purchase agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.
889900_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The note purchase agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio for the four prior quarters of EBITDA to interest charges for the same period.
889900_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Events of default under the note purchase agreement and the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	If an event of default under the note purchase agreement occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
889900_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	In addition, if we default in payments on any Note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the Notes held by it to be immediately due and payable.
889900_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	We believe that our liquidity as of December 31, 2011, which includes approximately $346 million in working capital and approximately $249 million available under our $400 million revolving credit facility, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to build new equipment, make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends.
889900_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing.
889900_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2011, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $40.6 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.
889900_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.
889900_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2011, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.
889900_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had commitments to purchase approximately $352 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants from certain vendors.
889900_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	These agreements expire in 2013 and 2016.
889900_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the remaining obligation under these agreements is approximately $42.5 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $13.5 million are expected to be delivered during 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.
889900_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	In November 2011, our pressure pumping business entered into an agreement with a proppant vendor to advance, on a non-revolving basis, up to $12.0 million to such vendor to finance its construction of certain processing facilities.
889900_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	This advance is secured by the underlying processing facilities and other assets and bears interest at an annual rate of 5.0%.
889900_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Repayment of the advance is to be made through discounts applied to purchases from the vendor and repayment of all amounts advanced must be made no later than October 1, 2017.
889900_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	As of December 31, 2011, advances of approximately $2.9 million had been made under this agreement and no significant repayments had been made.

889900_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of natural gas and oil.
889900_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years has also contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The average market price of natural gas and oil for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2011 and 2010 follows:
889900_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	(1) The average natural gas price represents the Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	(2) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of an increase in the number of operating days and increases in average revenue and direct operating costs per operating day.
889900_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Average revenue per operating day increased in 2011 primarily due to increases in contractual dayrates.
889900_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Average direct operating costs per operating day increased in 2011 due primarily to higher repairs, maintenance and labor costs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	The increase in operating days was largely due to increased demand resulting from higher oil prices.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2011 primarily as a result of increased personnel costs to support increased activity levels.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Capital expenditures were incurred in 2011 and 2010 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade our drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Depreciation expense increased as a result of capital expenditures.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	Depreciation and impairment expense included approximately $15.7 million in 2011 and approximately $4.2 million in 2010 of impairment charges related to drilling equipment on drilling rigs that were removed from our marketable fleet.

889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S5	Contributing to the increases in revenues, direct operating costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization was our acquisition of a pressure pumping business on October 1, 2010, which significantly expanded the size of our fleet of pressure pumping equipment and the markets in which we provide pressure pumping services.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S6	This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our pressure pumping segment results from the date of acquisition.
889900_12_ITEM7_P67_S7	The acquired business contributed revenue of $456 million and operating income of $106 million to our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to revenue of $84.7 million and operating income of $22.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our customers have increased their activities in the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage fracturing jobs associated therewith.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	We have added additional equipment through construction and acquisition to meet this demand and expand our area of operations.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	As a result, we have experienced an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fracturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	Average revenue per fracturing job increased as a result of this increase in the number of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2011 as compared to 2010, as well as increased pricing.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	Average revenue per other job increased as a result of increased pricing for the services provided and a change in job mix.
889900_12_ITEM7_P68_S5	Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily as a result of the increase in the number of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs.

889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Gains on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The gain on disposal of assets in 2011 is primarily related to the sale of scrap metal.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	The gain on asset disposals in 2010 includes a gain of $20.1 million related to the sale of certain rights to explore and develop zones deeper than the depths that we generally target for certain of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have working interests.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	The negative provision for bad debts in 2010 is the result of collections of certain accounts that had previously been reserved, as well as reductions in our reserve for specific accounts due to improved industry conditions.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	Acquisition-related expenses in 2010 were incurred in connection with the acquisition of pressure pumping and electric wireline businesses during the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	These expenses included certain legal and other professional fees directly related to the transaction, fees incurred in connection with the title transfers of the acquired equipment and transition costs related to information technology.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S6	Interest income in 2010 included the collection of interest on a customer account as well as interest received on prior overpayments of sales taxes in certain jurisdictions.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S7	Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to interest charges on the 4.97% Senior Notes that were issued in October 2010, the term loan that was entered into in August 2010 and interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
889900_12_ITEM7_P71_S8	Capital expenditures decreased in 2010 due to less activity with respect to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in 2011 compared to 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	On January 27, 2011, we sold our electric wireline business, which had been acquired by us on October 1, 2010.

889900_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Income Taxes The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008), and allows a deduction of 6% in 2009 and 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	The permanent differences for 2010 and 2009 reflect the recapture of a portion of this deduction due to the carryback of the net operating loss to prior years.
889900_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	This recapture resulted in a negative effective rate impact in 2009 due to our having a loss before income taxes in that year.
889900_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	The permanent difference for 2011 does not include any impact related to the Domestic Production Activities Deduction as such deduction is limited to the amount of taxable income in any given year and there is a tax loss in 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	We recognized deferred tax expense of approximately $159 million in 2011, $147 million in 2010 and $101 million in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S4	On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_12_ITEM7_P89_S5	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $25.2 million as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Prices are affected by factors such as market supply and demand, international military, political and economic conditions, the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production and price targets, technical advances affecting energy consumption and the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	During the second quarter of 2008, the quarterly average market price of natural gas (Henry Hub spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration) was $11.74 per Mcf and the quarterly average market price of oil (WTI spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $123.95 per barrel.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	In the last half of 2008, commodity prices rapidly declined and averaged $6.60 per Mcf for natural gas and $58.35 per barrel for oil in the fourth quarter of 2008.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	In 2009, the price of natural gas declined further and averaged $4.06 per Mcf for the year.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	These declines in the market price of natural gas and oil resulted in our customers significantly reducing their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S4	Drilling activities increased in 2010 as did the prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S5	The increased drilling activity was largely attributed to increased development of unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil which averaged $79.40 per barrel in 2010.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S6	Drilling for oil and liquids rich targets continued to increase in 2011 as oil averaged $94.86 per barrel for the year.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S7	Natural gas prices decreased in 2011 to an average of $4.00 per Mcf.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S8	The 2011 decrease in natural gas prices was most significant in the fourth quarter where the average price dropped to $3.32 per Mcf and this decrease has continued into 2012 where natural gas prices fell below $3.00 per Mcf in January.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S9	The increase in drilling activity in oil rich basins has absorbed the decrease in demand for natural gas drilling activities in 2011 and our rig count increased in both 2010 and 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P93_S10	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last ten years has significantly contributed to excess capacity.
889900_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined from historic highs.
889900_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	Low market prices for oil and natural gas would likely result in lower demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling and pressure pumping services.
889900_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P95_S4	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	This update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Previous guidance required an entity to test goodwill for impairment, on at least an annual basis, by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S3	If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S4	Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM7_P96_S5	This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Early adoption is permitted if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued.
889900_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	We elected to early adopt this accounting standards update as of December 31, 2011 as discussed further in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
889900_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
889900_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
889900_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	Historically, these components of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income have been presented in the statement of changes in stockholders equity by many companies, including us.
889900_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	This requirement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and will be effective for the Company in the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	The adoption of this update will result in the addition of a new consolidated statement of comprehensive income to our consolidated financial statements beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889900_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The amendments in this update do not require additional fair value measurements, but provide additional guidance as to measuring fair value as well as certain additional disclosure requirements.
889900_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and will be effective for us in the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	The adoption of this update will not have a material impact on the disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under our term credit facility or our revolving credit facility.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.75% to 3.75% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	At December 31, 2011, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had $110 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 4.05% and $92.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 3.25%.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S5	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our revolving and term credit facilities as of December 31, 2011 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $2.0 million.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Financial Statements are filed as a part of this Report at the end of Part IV hereof beginning at page F-1, Index to Consolidated Financial Statements, and are incorporated herein by this reference.
889900_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
889900_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

889900_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Report and which is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Report.
889900_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_12_ITEM15_P41_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P42_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A description of the business and basis of presentation follows: Description of business Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as Patterson-UTI or the Company ), provides onshore contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and western Canada.
889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company provides pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	The Company also invests, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Patterson-UTI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S4	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
889900_12_ITEM15_P47_S5	Except for wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has no controlling financial interests in any other entity which would require consolidation.
889900_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company s operations except for its Canadian operations, which use the Canadian dollar as its functional currency.
889900_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	The effects of exchange rate changes are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity.
889900_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	A summary of the significant accounting policies follows: Management estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company follows the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Under the percentage-of-completion method, management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	Due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and the risks therein, the Company follows the completed-contract method of accounting for such arrangements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	Under this method, revenues and expenses related to a well-in-progress are deferred and recognized in the period the well is completed.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S4	Provisions for losses on incomplete or in-process wells are made when estimated total expenses are expected to exceed total revenues.
889900_12_ITEM15_P52_S5	The Company recognizes as revenue reimbursements received from third parties for out-of-pocket expenses and accounts for those out-of-pocket expenses as direct costs.
889900_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Except for two wells drilled under footage contacts in 2009, all of the wells the Company drilled in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount.
889900_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses existing in the Company s accounts receivable.
889900_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at least quarterly.
889900_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability.
889900_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Account balances, when determined to be uncollectable, are charged against the allowance.
889900_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Inventories Inventories consist primarily of sand and chemical products to be used in conjunction with the Company s pressure pumping activities.
889900_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	The inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method.
889900_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
889900_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S6	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S7	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S8	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_12_ITEM15_P60_S9	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on management s expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company reviews unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company s impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as management s intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company assesses impairment of its goodwill at least annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Maintenance and repairs Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing property and equipment are capitalized.
889900_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	Disposals Upon disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
889900_12_ITEM15_P64_S3	Net income (loss) per common share The Company provides a dual presentation of its net income (loss) per common share in its consolidated statements of operations: Basic net income (loss) per common share ( Basic EPS ) and diluted net income (loss) per common share ( Diluted EPS ).
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S3	The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using the treasury stock method.
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S4	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_12_ITEM15_P65_S5	The following table presents information necessary to calculate income (loss) from continuing operations per share, loss from discontinued operations per share and net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands, except per share amounts):
889900_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income taxes The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
889900_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_12_ITEM15_P66_S4	If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses.
889900_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_12_ITEM15_P68_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 11).
889900_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	This update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	Previous guidance required an entity to test goodwill for impairment, on at least an annual basis, by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S3	If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S4	Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM15_P70_S5	This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	Early adoption is permitted if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued.
889900_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company has elected to early adopt this accounting standard update as of December 31, 2011 as discussed further in Note 5.
889900_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
889900_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	Historically, these components of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income have been presented in the statement of changes in stockholders equity by many companies, including the Company.
889900_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	This requirement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and will be effective for the Company in the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM15_P72_S4	The adoption of this update will result in the addition of a new consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the Company s consolidated financial statements beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889900_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The amendments in this update do not require additional fair value measurements, but provide additional guidance as to measuring fair value as well as certain additional disclosure requirements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and will be effective for the Company in the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
889900_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Discontinued Operations On January 20, 2010, the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids business, which had previously been presented as one of the Company s reportable operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	On that date, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, completed the sale of substantially all of its assets, excluding billed accounts receivable.
889900_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	The sales price was approximately $42.6 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	Upon the Company s exit from the drilling and completion fluids business, the Company classified its drilling and completion fluids operating segment as a discontinued operation and an impairment loss was recognized in 2009 to reduce the carrying value of the assets to be disposed of to fair value less estimated costs to sell and no significant gain or loss was recognized in connection with the sale in 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P74_S4	The results of operations of this business have been reclassified and presented as results of discontinued operations for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	On January 27, 2011, the stock of the Company s electric wireline subsidiary, Universal Wireline, Inc., was sold in a cash transaction for $25.5 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	Except for inventory, the working capital of Universal Wireline, Inc. was excluded from the sale and retained by a subsidiary of the Company.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	Universal Wireline, Inc. was formed in 2010 to acquire the electric wireline business of Key Energy Services, Inc., as discussed in Note 3.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	The results of operations of this business have been presented as results of discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the assets to be disposed of were classified as held for sale and are presented separately within current assets under the caption Assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	Upon being classified as held for sale, the assets to be disposed of were recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell resulting in a charge of $2.2 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S4	Due to the fact that the carrying value of the assets had been adjusted to net realizable value, no significant additional gain or loss was recognized in connection with the sale.
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S5	Summarized operating results from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown below (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P76_S6	The components of assets held for sale at December 31, 2010 are shown below (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	electric wireline services to participants in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	This acquisition expanded the Company s pressure pumping operations to additional markets primarily in Texas.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The aggregate purchase price was approximately $241 million and was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	The tangible assets acquired include property and equipment, inventories of sand and chemicals on hand and repair and maintenance supplies on hand.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S4	The identifiable intangible assets acquired include an agreement by the seller to not compete for a period of three years and the customer relationships in place at the time of the acquisition.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S5	The liabilities assumed arose from pricing agreements in place with certain customers that had pricing below current market rates.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S6	A related deferred tax asset was recognized to reflect the temporary difference associated with these below-market pricing arrangements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S7	The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible assets, the identifiable intangible assets and deferred tax asset, net of the liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill and was attributed to the pressure pumping business acquired.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S8	A summary of the purchase price allocation follows (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S9	In addition to the purchase price, acquisition-related expenses associated with this transaction of approximately $2.5 million were incurred by the Company and are presented in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption acquisition-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S10	These expenses include certain legal and other professional fees directly related to the transaction, fees incurred in connection with title transfers of the acquired equipment and transition costs related to information technology.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S11	As discussed in Note 2, the electric wireline business was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010 and was subsequently sold on January 27, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S12	The results of operations of the wireline business from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2010 included revenue of $5.7 million and a pre-tax operating loss of $1.5 million (including a charge of approximately $2.2 million incurred to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to its net realizable value) which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S13	Results of operations of the acquired pressure pumping business are included in the Company s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S14	Revenues of $84.7 million and income from operations of $22.8 million from the acquired pressure pumping business are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P77_S15	The following represents pro-forma unaudited financial information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2009 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

889900_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The following table summarizes depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense related to property and equipment and intangible assets for 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	In light of adverse market conditions affecting the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, including a substantial decrease in the operating levels of its contract drilling business segment and a significant decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to perform an assessment with respect to impairment of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, within its contract drilling segment in 2009.
889900_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	In light of favorable trends in rig utilization and revenue per operating day experienced by the Company and its peers in 2010 and 2011, management concluded that no triggering event had occurred in 2010 or 2011 with respect to its contract drilling segment as a whole (excluding the rigs which had been removed from the Company s marketable fleet as discussed below).
889900_12_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to its pressure pumping segment in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets at the end of each quarter due to revisions in its oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be separated from other long-lived assets.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company performs the first step of its impairment assessments by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each long-lived asset or asset group to its respective carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S3	Based on the results of these impairment tests, the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in the contract drilling and oil and natural gas segments were determined to be recoverable, except as described below.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S4	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S5	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S6	The Company recorded impairment charges of $3.0 million, $792,000 and $3.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to its oil and natural gas properties.
889900_12_ITEM15_P81_S7	The Company determined the fair value of the impaired assets using internally developed unobservable inputs including future pricing and reserves (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	In connection with the Company s ongoing planning process, it evaluated its then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2011, 2010 and 2009 and identified 53, four and 23 rigs, during each of those years respectively, that it determined were impaired and would no longer be marketed as rigs based on its assessment of estimated expenditures to bring these rigs into condition to operate in the current environment as well as its assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to its yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	The fair value of the remaining components of these rigs was estimated to be zero as there was no future cash flow expected and the associated net book value of $15.7 million in 2011, $4.2 million in 2010 and $10.5 million in 2009 was expensed in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	During 2010, the Company sold certain rights to explore and develop zones deeper than depths that it generally targets for certain of the oil and natural gas properties in which it has working interests.
889900_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The proceeds from this sale were approximately $22.3 million and the sale resulted in a gain on disposal of $20.1 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill by operating segment as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and changes for the years then ended are as follows (in thousands): Goodwill was recorded in connection with a business combination in 2010 as a result of the Company s acquisition of the pressure pumping business of Key Energy Services, Inc. on October 1, 2010, as discussed further in Note 3.
889900_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Approximately $53.2 million of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
889900_12_ITEM15_P84_S2	There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually on December 31 to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Goodwill impairment is measured using a two-step impairment test.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	In connection with the Company s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2010, the Company estimated its enterprise value based on the market capitalization of the Company as determined by reference to the closing price of the Company s common stock during the fifteen days before and after year end.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	This enterprise value was allocated to the Company s reporting units and it was determined that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were in excess of their carrying value.
889900_12_ITEM15_P86_S5	As a result, the Company concluded that no impairment of goodwill was indicated as of December 31, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test described above is unnecessary.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	The provisions of this accounting standards update are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, however, early adoption is permitted.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	The Company elected to adopt the provisions of the new goodwill impairment accounting standard issued in September 2011 in connection with its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of December 31, 2011 and determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S4	In making this determination, the Company considered the continued demand experienced during 2011 for its services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S5	The Company also considered the level of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence its overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S6	Additionally, current year operating results and forecasted operating results for the coming year were also taken into account.
889900_12_ITEM15_P87_S7	The Company s overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of the Company s reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from its 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company has undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade its fleet of equipment and believes that it is positioned well from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that may result from recent decreases in natural gas prices.
889900_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	In the event that market conditions weaken, the Company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of the pressure pumping business discussed in Note 3.
889900_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	As a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded intangible assets related to a non-compete agreement and the customer relationships acquired.
889900_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	These intangible assets were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
889900_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	The non-compete agreement has a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_12_ITEM15_P89_S4	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Amortization expense of $467,000 and $116,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, associated with the non-compete agreement.
889900_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The value of the customer relationships was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model to determine the present value of the projected cash flows associated with the customers in place at the time of the acquisition and taking into account a contributory asset charge.
889900_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The resulting intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years.
889900_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Amortization expense of $3.6 million and $910,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, associated with customer relationships.

889900_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The deferred revenue relates to out-of-market pricing agreements that were in place at the acquired business at the time of the acquisition.
889900_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	The deferred revenue will be recognized as pressure pumping revenue over the remaining term of the pricing agreements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	Deferred revenue of approximately $8.4 million and $6.1 million was recognized in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to these pricing agreements.
889900_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	Asset Retirement Obligation The Company records a liability for the estimated costs to be incurred in connection with the abandonment of oil and natural gas properties in the future.

889900_12_ITEM15_P140_S3	The performance goals for the 2009 Performance Units are tied to the Company s total shareholder return for the performance period as compared to total shareholder return for a peer group determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
889900_12_ITEM15_P140_S4	These goals are considered to be market conditions under the relevant accounting standards and the market conditions are factored into the determination of the fair value of the performance units.
889900_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Generally, the recipients will receive a base payment if the Company s total shareholder return is positive and, when compared to the peer group, is at or above the 25 th percentile but less than the 50 th percentile, two times the base if at or above the 50 th percentile but less than the 75 th percentile, and four times the base if at the 75 th percentile or higher.
889900_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	The total base amount with respect to the 2009 Performance Units is approximately $1.7 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	Because the 2009 Performance Units are to be settled in cash at the end of the performance period, they are accounted for as liability awards and the Company s pro-rated obligation is measured at estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	As of December 31, 2011 this pro-rated obligation was approximately $3.6 million and is included in the caption accrued expenses in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet.

889900_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	The 2010 Performance Units and the 2011 Performance Units provide for those executive officers to receive a grant of shares of stock upon the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee during a specified period.
889900_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	The performance period for the 2010 Performance Units is the period from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2013, but can extend through March 31, 2015 in certain circumstances.

889900_12_ITEM15_P142_S4	The performance goals for the 2010 Performance Units and the 2011 Performance Units are tied to the Company s total shareholder return for the performance period as compared to total shareholder return for a peer group determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
889900_12_ITEM15_P142_S5	These goals are considered to be market conditions under the relevant accounting standards and the market conditions are factored into the determination of the fair value of the respective performance units.
889900_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Generally, the recipients will receive a base number of shares if the Company s total shareholder return is positive and, when compared to the peer group, is at the 25 th percentile, two times the base if at the 50 th percentile, and four times the base if at the 75 th percentile or higher.

889900_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	The total base number of shares with respect to the 2010 Performance Units is 89,375 shares and the total base number of shares with respect to the 2011 Performance Units is 72,188 shares.
889900_12_ITEM15_P143_S3	Because the 2010 and 2011 Performance Units are stock-settled awards, they are accounted for as equity awards and measured at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_12_ITEM15_P143_S4	The fair value of the 2010 Performance Units as of the date of grant was approximately $3.1 million and the fair value of the 2011 Performance Units as of the date of grant was approximately $5.6 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P143_S5	This fair value is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period.

889900_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	Dividends are recognized as reductions of retained earnings for the portion of restricted stock awards expected to vest.
889900_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	Dividends are recognized as additional compensation cost for the portion of restricted stock awards that are not expected to vest or that ultimately do not vest.
889900_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Dividend equivalents are recognized as additional compensation cost for restricted stock units.
889900_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company incurred rent expense of $35.0 million, $18.1 million and $11.9 million for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

889900_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	Components of the income tax provision applicable to federal, state and foreign income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:
889900_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,) and allows a deduction of 6% in 2009 and 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	The permanent differences for 2010 and 2009 reflect the recapture of a portion of this deduction due to the carryback of the 2010 and 2009 net operating losses to prior years.
889900_12_ITEM15_P151_S2	This recapture resulted in a negative effective rate impact in 2009 due to the Company having a loss before income taxes in that year.
889900_12_ITEM15_P151_S3	The permanent difference for 2011 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company had a tax loss in 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes therein were as follows (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889900_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
889900_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	The Company expects the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities and the generation of taxable income; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary.
889900_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of various allowance accounts and tax-deferred expenses expected to generate future tax benefits of approximately $29.5 million.
889900_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	Other deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of the tax effect of receivables from insurance companies and tax-deferred income not yet recognized for tax purposes.
889900_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	For income tax purposes, the Company generated approximately $327 million of federal net operating losses and approximately $136 million of state net operating losses during the year ended December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	Of these amounts, approximately $11.1 million will be carried back to prior years, and the remaining balance can be carried forward to future years along with prior year carryovers in the amount of $118 million.

889900_12_ITEM15_P155_S4	On January 1, 2010, the Company converted its Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_12_ITEM15_P155_S5	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_12_ITEM15_P155_S6	As a result of the above conversion, the Company s Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_12_ITEM15_P155_S7	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company has elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intends to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_12_ITEM15_P155_S8	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $25.2 million as of December 31, 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for all eligible employees.
889900_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	The Company s operating results include expenses of approximately $4.6 million in 2011, $3.1 million in 2010 and $2.8 million in 2009 for the Company s cash contributions to the plan.
889900_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company s revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three business segments: (i) contract drilling of oil and natural gas wells, (ii) pressure pumping services and (iii) the investment, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	Each of these segments represents a distinct type of business.
889900_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	These segments have separate management teams which report to the Company s chief operating decision maker.
889900_12_ITEM15_P157_S3	The results of operations in these segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
889900_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	As discussed in Note 2, in January 2010, the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids services business which previously was reported as a business segment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	Operating results for that business for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations.

889900_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	Pressure pumping services are primarily well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Well stimulation involves processes inside a well designed to enhance the flow of oil, natural gas, or other desired substances from the well.
889900_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	Cementing is the process of inserting material between the hole and the pipe to center and stabilize the pipe in the hole.
889900_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company owns and invests in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Company s oil and natural gas interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	The following tables summarize selected financial information relating to the Company s business segments (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	(a) Includes contract drilling intercompany revenues related to drilling services provided to the oil and natural gas exploration and production segment.
889900_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	(b) Net gains or losses associated with the disposal of assets relate to corporate strategy decisions of the executive management group.
889900_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been separately presented and excluded from the results of specific segments.
889900_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	(c) Corporate and other assets primarily include identifiable assets associated with assets held for sale as well as cash on hand, income taxes receivable and certain deferred federal income tax assets.
889900_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of demand deposits, temporary cash investments and trade receivables.
889900_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	The Company believes it has placed its demand deposits and temporary cash investments with high credit-quality financial institutions.
889900_12_ITEM15_P170_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company s demand deposits and temporary cash investments consisted of the following (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are primarily focused on companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties.
889900_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	The concentration is somewhat mitigated by the diversification of customers for which the Company provides services.
889900_12_ITEM15_P171_S2	As is general industry practice, the Company typically does not require customers to provide collateral.
889900_12_ITEM15_P171_S3	No significant losses from individual customers were experienced during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.

889900_12_ITEM15_P171_S5	The Company recorded a provision for bad debts for 2010 and 2009 of $(2.0) million and $3.8 million, respectively.
889900_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	The estimated fair value of the Company s outstanding debt balances (including current portion) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below (in thousands):
889900_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	The carrying value of the balance outstanding under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility approximates fair value as both facilities have a floating interest rate that adjusts at each quarterly interest payment date.
889900_12_ITEM15_P172_S3	The fair value of the 4.97% Series A Senior Notes at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is based on discounted cash flows associated with the Senior Notes using current market rates of interest at those respective dates.
889900_12_ITEM15_P172_S4	These fair value estimates are based on observable market inputs and are considered level 2 fair value estimates in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting.
889900_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	As discussed in Note 2, the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids services business in January 2010 and sold a recently acquired wireline business in January 2011.
889900_12_ITEM15_P173_S1	The results of operations related to those businesses have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations in the quarterly financial information above.

889900_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	The SEC maintains an internet site ( www.sec.gov ) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
889900_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We own and operate one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs in the United States.
889900_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company was formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States, Alaska, and western and northern Canada.
889900_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 314 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	A drilling rig is considered marketable at a point in time if it is operating or can be made ready to operate without significant capital expenditures.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	We also own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S6	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S7	Prior to January 20, 2010, we provided drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and on land in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S8	We sold our drilling and completion fluids services business on January 20, 2010.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S9	On October 1, 2010, we acquired the assets and operations of a pressure pumping business and an electric wireline business.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S10	The electric wireline business that we acquired was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010 and sold on January 27, 2011.
889900_13_ITEM1_P6_S11	The results of our drilling and completion fluids services business and our electric wireline business are presented as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
889900_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	oil and natural gas exploration and production.
889900_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	All of our industry segments had operating profits in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
889900_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had 314 marketable land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	18 in western and northern Canada.
889900_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our marketable drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 5,250 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Of these drilling rigs, 167 are electric rigs and 147 are mechanical rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the power from its engines (the sole energy source for a mechanical rig) into electricity to power the rig.
889900_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as replacement parts for marketable rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs to ensure that our drilling equipment is competitive.
889900_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	We have spent over $2.2 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.
889900_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, we spent approximately $745 million, $785 million and $656 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	During 2012, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 22 days.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S5	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S6	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S7	We believe that our drilling contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S8	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork, footage or turnkey basis, or a combination thereof.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S9	In each case, we provide the rig and crews.
889900_13_ITEM1_P16_S10	Our bid for each job depends upon location, depth and anticipated complexity of the well, on-site drilling conditions, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed well.
889900_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The customer supervises the drilling of the well.
889900_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	All of the wells we drilled in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were under daywork contracts.
889900_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Under footage contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot.
889900_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	The customer provides drilling fluids, casing, cementing and well design expertise.
889900_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	If we drill the well in less time than estimated, we have the opportunity to improve our profits over those that would be attainable under a daywork contract.
889900_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Profits are reduced and losses may be incurred if the well requires more days to drill to the contracted depth than estimated.
889900_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Footage contracts generally contain greater risks for a drilling contractor than daywork contracts.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Under footage contracts, the drilling contractor typically assumes certain risks associated with loss of the well from fire, blowouts and other risks.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Although we have entered into footage contracts in the past, we did not drill any wells under footage contracts in the past three years.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Under turnkey contracts, we contract to drill a well to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed fee.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	In a turnkey arrangement, we are required to bear the costs of services, supplies and equipment beyond those typically provided under a footage contract.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	In addition to the drilling rig and crew, we are required to provide the drilling and completion fluids, casing, cementing, and the technical well design and engineering services during the drilling process.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	We also typically assume certain risks associated with drilling the well such as fires, blowouts, cratering of the well bore and other such risks.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S6	Compensation occurs only when the agreed-upon scope of the work has been completed, which requires us to make larger up-front working capital commitments prior to receiving payments under a turnkey drilling contract.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S7	Under a turnkey contract, we have the opportunity to improve our profits if the drilling process goes as expected and there are no complications or time delays.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S8	Given the increased exposure we have under a turnkey contract, however, profits can be significantly reduced and losses can be incurred if complications or delays occur during the drilling process.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S9	Turnkey contracts generally involve the highest degree of risk among the three different types of drilling contracts.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S10	Although we have entered into turnkey contracts in the past, we did not drill any wells under turnkey contracts in the past three years.
889900_13_ITEM1_P22_S11	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	(1) A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	While conventional wells remain an important source of natural gas and oil, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for natural gas and oil in North America.
889900_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	To address our customers needs for drilling wells in the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	APEX 1500 rigs are 1,500 horsepower electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other highly automated pipe handling equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	APEX 1000 rigs are 1,000 horsepower electric rigs with advanced technology equipment similar to the APEX 1500 rigs, but with a more compact design to fit on smaller locations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	APEX WALKING rigs are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	Some APEX 1500 and APEX 1000 rigs have also been equipped with walking systems.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2012 our drilling fleet was comprised of the following: We estimate the depth capacity with respect to our marketable rigs as of December 31, 2012 to be as follows: At December 31, 2012, we owned and operated 312 trucks and 410 trailers used to rig down, transport and rig up our drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our ownership of trucks and trailers reduces our dependency upon third parties for these services and generally enhances the efficiency of our contract drilling operations in periods of high drilling rig utilization.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	We perform repair and overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (Southwest Region) and the Appalachian Basin (Northeast Region).
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S5	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S6	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_13_ITEM1_P27_S7	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	We believe that our pressure pumping contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each pressure pumping contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrogen fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 758,000 hydraulic horsepower as of December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2012 included:
889900_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that do not cover all of our required supply and that sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Interests We own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in producing regions of Texas and New Mexico.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	The customers of each of our contract drilling and pressure pumping business segments are oil and natural gas operators.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our customer base includes both major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_13_ITEM1_P33_S5	During 2012, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Competition Our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand.
889900_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	Any suspension or moratorium of the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_13_ITEM1_P39_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into waters from facilities.
889900_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
889900_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shales and other unconventional formations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	In Canada, a variety of Canadian federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S6	For example, on August 16, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards ( NSPS ) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAP ) that impose, among other things, new standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells.
889900_13_ITEM1_P49_S7	For more information, please refer to our discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Environmental Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S5	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S9	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customer to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S11	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S12	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S13	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S14	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary for our businesses, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S15	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S16	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S17	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S18	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S19	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S20	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S21	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S22	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S23	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S24	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_13_ITEM1_P50_S25	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	We had approximately 7,300 full-time employees at December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_13_ITEM1_P51_S6	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.
889900_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada and, to a lesser extent, our pressure pumping operations in the Appalachian Basin, are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual Spring thaw.
889900_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets may result in reduced access to financing by our customers and reduced demand for our services.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Although the significant deterioration in the global economic environment appeared to stabilize to some degree since 2009, there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Prices are affected by factors such as:
889900_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	During the second quarter of 2008, the quarterly average market price of natural gas (Henry Hub spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $11.74 per Mcf and the quarterly average market price of oil (WTI spot price as reported by the Energy Information Administration) was $123.95 per barrel.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In the last half of 2008, commodity prices rapidly declined and averaged $6.60 per Mcf for natural gas and $58.35 per barrel for oil in the fourth quarter of 2008.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In 2009, the price of natural gas declined further and averaged $4.06 per Mcf for the year.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Oil prices remained depressed during 2009 as well and averaged $61.65 per barrel for the year.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	These declines in the market prices of natural gas and oil caused our customers to significantly reduce their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Drilling activities increased in 2010 as did the prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	The increased drilling activity was largely attributable to increased development of unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil which averaged $79.40 per barrel in 2010.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Drilling for oil and liquids rich targets continued to increase in 2011 as oil averaged $94.86 per barrel for the year.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Natural gas prices decreased in 2011 to an average of $4.00 per Mcf.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The 2011 decrease in natural gas prices was most significant in the fourth quarter where the average price dropped to $3.32 per Mcf.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S10	This decrease continued into 2012 where natural gas prices fell below $2.00 per Mcf in April and averaged $2.75 per Mcf for the year, resulting in continued low levels of drilling activity for natural gas in 2012.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S11	The increase in drilling activity in oil rich basins absorbed some of the decrease in demand for natural gas drilling activities in 2012.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last decade has significantly contributed to excess capacity in total available drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined from historic highs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Low market prices for oil and natural gas would likely result in lower demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:
889900_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	construction of new technology drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Construction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and there has been a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment across the industry.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result of low natural gas prices and the construction of new equipment, there is currently an excess of pressure pumping equipment available.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In circumstances of excess capacity, providers of pressure pumping services have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Shortages of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Fixed Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Fixed term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, no early termination payment may be paid to us.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The failure to receive an early termination payment under a number of our fixed-term contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Oil Service Business Segments in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	At times, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	The fact that drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue to be intense due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Labor Shortages and Rising Labor Costs Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During periods of increasing demand for contract drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry experiences shortages of qualified personnel.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	During these periods, our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to market and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment is adversely affected, which negatively impacts both our operations and profitability.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Operationally, it is more difficult to hire qualified personnel, which adversely affects our ability to mobilize inactive rigs and pressure pumping equipment in response to the increased demand for such services.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, wage rates for drilling and pressure pumping personnel are likely to increase during periods of increasing demand, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In 2012, we received approximately 40% of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest customers and approximately 25% of our consolidated operating revenues from our five largest customers.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Although no single customer accounted for more than approximately seven percent of our consolidated operating revenue in 2012, the loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S14	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S15	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability insurance, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S16	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S17	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S18	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S19	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability insurance coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S20	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S21	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S22	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S23	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S24	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S25	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P20_S26	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	New Technologies, Process Improvements and Other Factors May Cause Our Drilling and Pressure Pumping Processes and Equipment to Become Less Competitive and Oil and Natural Gas Wells to be Drilled and Completed More Quickly, Resulting in an Adverse Effect on our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Changes in technology or improvements in competitors processes and equipment could make our processes and equipment less competitive or require significant capital expenditures to keep our processes and equipment competitive.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any such changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Environmental Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S6	All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P21_S8	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to substantial civil and criminal penalties.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States and Canada impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including NSPS to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and NESHAPS to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, gas wells are now required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	These rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As part of their respective studies, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and the EPA each sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We have responded to each of the inquiries.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Certain states where we operate, including Texas, have adopted or are considering similar disclosure legislation.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	In addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act s Underground Injection Control Program and is developing guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	For example, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The EPA released a progress report on December 21, 2012 outlining work currently underway and is expected to release results of the study in 2014.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, the EPA announced on October 20, 2011 that it is launching a study of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose pretreatment regulations by 2014.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S5	The adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHG present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Based on its findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act, including one regulation that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large sources.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, the EPA published rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, which has been amended to include certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We Are Dependent Upon our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under our Long Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes, term loan facility and, from time to time, revolving credit facility.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	At December 31, 2012, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $98.8 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.625%.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2012 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.0 million.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S8	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S9	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S10	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S11	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S12	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_13_ITEM1A_P29_S13	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.

889900_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included as Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report.
889900_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	Due to the sale of our drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010 and the sale of our electric wireline business in January 2011, the results of operations for those businesses have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management Overview We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition to the aforementioned services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prior to the sale of substantially all of the assets of our drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010, we provided drilling fluids, completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	Due to our exit from the drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010, we have presented the results of that business as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	We acquired an electric wireline business on October 1, 2010 and sold the business on January 27, 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	Due to our exit from the electric wireline business, we have presented the results of that business as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 314 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, crude oil prices are volatile and natural gas prices remain low.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Activity in our drilling business decreased in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2012, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 206, as compared to an average of 232 drilling rigs operating during the same period in 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling wells in the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we have completed 113 new APEX rigs and made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	We have plans to complete 13 additional new APEX rigs in 2013.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	In connection with the newer horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 758,000 hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_13_ITEM7_P2_S8	This is a net increase of approximately 600,000 horsepower since the end of 2009.
889900_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Low natural gas prices and the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace has led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our backlog as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $1.24 billion.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	We expect approximately $766 million of our backlog to be realized in 2013.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	We calculate our backlog by multiplying the day rate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Fixed Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	For the three years ended December 31, 2012, our operating revenues from continuing operations consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	average number of rigs operating was 221 compared to 216 in 2011 and 168 in 2010.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our average revenue per operating day was $22,540 in 2012 compared to $21,200 in 2011 and $17,670 in 2010.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our pressure pumping segment experienced an increase in large multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2011 compared to 2010; this increase includes the contribution of a pressure pumping business we acquired on October 1, 2010, which significantly expanded our pressure pumping operations into new markets in the fourth quarter of 2010.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	In 2012, however, margins from the pressure pumping segment were lower than in 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	We had consolidated net income of $299 million for 2012 compared to $322 million for 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	The decrease in consolidated net income was primarily due to higher depreciation expense.
889900_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	After reaching a peak in June 2008, there was a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices and a substantial deterioration in the global economic environment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	As part of this deterioration, there was substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing was reduced.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Due to these conditions, our customers reduced or curtailed their drilling programs, which resulted in a decrease in demand for our services, as evidenced by the decline in our monthly average number of rigs operating from a high of 283 in October 2008 to a low of 60 in June 2009.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our monthly average number of rigs operating has subsequently increased from the mid-year low of 60 in 2009 to 233 in December 2011.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	In December 2012, our average number of rigs operating was 205.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_13_ITEM7_P8_S6	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured based on discounted cash flows.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In connection with our ongoing planning process, we evaluated our then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2012, 2011 and 2010 and identified 36, 53 and four rigs, during each of those years, respectively, that we determined were impaired and would no longer be marketed as rigs based on our assessment of estimated expenditures to bring these rigs into condition to operate in the current environment, as well as our assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	The fair value of the remaining components of these rigs was estimated to be zero as there were no future cash flows expected.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	We also evaluate our fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The identified pressure pumping equipment was impaired and estimated to have no fair value as there were no future cash flows expected.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The net book value of the impaired assets of $12.5 million in 2012, $15.7 million in 2011 and $4.2 million in 2010 was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	In light of the levels of activity and revenue per operating day experienced by us and our peers in 2012, 2011 and 2010, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during these years with respect to our contract drilling segment as a whole which would indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in that segment may not be recoverable (excluding the rigs which had been removed from our marketable fleet).
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	We also concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to our pressure pumping segment in 2012, 2011 or 2010 (excluding the equipment that was retired discussed above).
889900_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.
889900_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We evaluate goodwill at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.
889900_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	We currently have goodwill in our contract drilling and pressure pumping operating segments.
889900_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is less than its fair value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2012 and 2011 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Additionally, operating results for 2012 and 2011 and forecasted operating results for 2013 were also taken into account.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from our 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted from low natural gas prices.
889900_13_ITEM7_P20_S9	In the event that market conditions weaken, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	All of the wells we drilled in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_13_ITEM7_P26_S7	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future commodity prices over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on our expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $1.9 million, $3.0 million and $792,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under our term credit facility or our revolving credit facility.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At December 31, 2012, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $98.8 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.625%.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2012 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.0 million.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
889900_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
889900_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Report and which is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Report.
889900_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company ) at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_13_ITEM15_P42_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A description of the business and basis of presentation follows: Description of business Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as Patterson-UTI or the Company ), provides onshore contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators in the continental United States, Alaska and western and northern Canada.
889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company provides pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian Basin.
889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company also invests in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.
889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S3	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Patterson-UTI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S4	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
889900_13_ITEM15_P49_S5	Except for wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has no controlling financial interests in any other entity which would require consolidation.
889900_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company s operations except for its Canadian operations, which use the Canadian dollar as its functional currency.
889900_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	The effects of exchange rate changes are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity.
889900_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	A summary of the significant accounting policies follows: Management estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	All of the wells the Company drilled in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount.
889900_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses existing in the Company s accounts receivable.
889900_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at least quarterly.
889900_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability.
889900_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Account balances, when determined to be uncollectable, are charged against the allowance.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Inventories Inventories consist primarily of sand and other products to be used in conjunction with the Company s pressure pumping activities.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S4	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_13_ITEM15_P58_S5	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S6	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment, lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized on the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S7	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S8	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_13_ITEM15_P61_S9	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and discounted cash flow.
889900_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The discounted cash flow estimates used in measuring impairment are based on management s expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field.
889900_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company reviews unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company s impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as management s intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company assesses impairment of its goodwill at least annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Maintenance and repairs Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing property and equipment are capitalized.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	Disposals Upon disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	Net income (loss) per common share The Company provides a dual presentation of its net income (loss) per common share in its consolidated statements of operations: Basic net income (loss) per common share ( Basic EPS ) and diluted net income (loss) per common share ( Diluted EPS ).
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S5	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S6	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S7	The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using the treasury stock method.
889900_13_ITEM15_P65_S8	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate income from continuing operations per share, loss from discontinued operations per share and net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands, except per share amounts): Income taxes The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
889900_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_13_ITEM15_P66_S4	If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 11).
889900_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
889900_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income.
889900_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	Historically, these components of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income have been presented in the statement of changes in stockholders equity by many companies, including the Company.
889900_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	This requirement was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and was effective for the Company in the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM15_P69_S4	The adoption of this update resulted in the addition of a new consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the Company s consolidated financial statements beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
889900_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	The amendments in this update do not require additional fair value measurements, but provide additional guidance as to measuring fair value as well as certain additional disclosure requirements.

889900_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	In light of levels of activity and revenue per operating day experienced by the Company and its peers in 2010, 2011 and 2012, management concluded that no triggering event had occurred in 2010, 2011 or 2012 with respect to its contract drilling segment as a whole (excluding the rigs which had been removed from the Company s marketable fleet as discussed below).
889900_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company also concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to its pressure pumping segment in 2010, 2011 or 2012 (excluding the equipment that was retired as discussed below).
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets at the end of each quarter due to revisions in its oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be separated from other long-lived assets.
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company performs the first step of its impairment assessments by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each long-lived asset or asset group to its respective carrying value.
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S3	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S4	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.
889900_13_ITEM15_P81_S5	The Company recorded impairment charges of $1.9 million, $3.0 million and $792,000 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to its oil and natural gas properties.

889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	In connection with the Company s ongoing planning process, it evaluated its then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2012, 2011 and 2010 and identified 36, 53 and four rigs, during each of those years respectively, that it determined were impaired and would no longer be marketed as rigs based on its assessment of estimated expenditures to bring these rigs into condition to operate in the current environment, as well as its assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to its yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S3	The fair value of the remaining components of these rigs was estimated to be zero as there were no future cash flows expected.
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S4	The Company also evaluates its fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S5	The identified pressure pumping equipment was impaired and estimated to have no fair value as there were no future cash flows expected.
889900_13_ITEM15_P82_S6	The net book value of the impaired assets of $12.5 million in 2012, $15.7 million in 2011 and $4.2 million in 2010 was expensed in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as an impairment charge.
889900_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	During 2010, the Company sold certain rights to explore and develop zones deeper than depths that it generally targets for certain of the oil and natural gas properties in which it has working interests.

889900_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	Approximately $53.2 million of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
889900_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
889900_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	In connection with its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	In making this determination, the Company considered the continued demand experienced during 2012 and 2011 for its services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence its overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_13_ITEM15_P88_S3	Additionally, operating results for 2012 and 2011 and forecasted operating results for 2013 were also taken into account.
889900_13_ITEM15_P88_S4	The Company s overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of the Company s reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from its 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company has undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade its fleet of equipment and believes that it is positioned well from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted from low natural gas prices.
889900_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	In the event that market conditions weaken, the Company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of the pressure pumping business discussed in Note 3.

889900_13_ITEM15_P90_S3	The non-compete agreement has a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_13_ITEM15_P90_S4	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	Amortization expense of $467,000, $467,000 and $116,000 was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, associated with the non-compete agreement.
889900_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	The value of the customer relationships was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model to determine the present value of the projected cash flows associated with the customers in place at the time of the acquisition and taking into account a contributory asset charge.
889900_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	The resulting intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years.
889900_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	Amortization expense of $3.6 million, $3.6 million and $910,000 was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, associated with customer relationships.

889900_13_ITEM15_P145_S2	The grant of shares when achievement is between the 25 th and 75 th percentile will be determined on a pro-rata basis.
889900_13_ITEM15_P145_S3	The total target number of shares with respect to the Stock-Settled Performance Units is set forth below: Because the Stock-Settled Performance Units are stock-settled awards, they are accounted for as equity awards and measured at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_13_ITEM15_P145_S4	The fair value of the Stock-Settled Performance Units is set forth below (in thousands):
889900_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	These fair value amounts are charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the performance period.

889900_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	These payments are recognized as follows:
889900_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	Dividends are recognized as reductions of retained earnings for the portion of restricted stock awards expected to vest.
889900_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	Dividends are recognized as additional compensation cost for the portion of restricted stock awards that are not expected to vest or that ultimately do not vest.

889900_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Company s obligations under non-cancelable operating lease agreements are not material to its operations or cash flows.
889900_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	Components of the income tax provision applicable to federal, state and foreign income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
889900_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows:
889900_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	The permanent difference for 2010 reflects the recapture of a portion of this deduction due to the carryback of the 2010 net operating loss to prior years.
889900_13_ITEM15_P153_S2	The permanent difference for 2011 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company had a tax loss in 2011.
889900_13_ITEM15_P153_S3	The permanent difference for 2012 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company does not have taxable income in 2012 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes therein were as follows (in thousands):
889900_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889900_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
889900_13_ITEM15_P155_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
889900_13_ITEM15_P155_S3	The Company expects the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities and the generation of taxable income; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary.
889900_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of various allowance accounts and tax-deferred expenses expected to generate future tax benefits of approximately $35.6 million.
889900_13_ITEM15_P156_S1	Other deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of the tax effect of receivables from insurance companies and tax-deferred income not yet recognized for tax purposes.
889900_13_ITEM15_P156_S2	For income tax purposes, the Company has approximately $54.0 million of federal net operating losses and approximately $169.0 million of state net operating losses that can be carried forward as of December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM15_P156_S3	The federal net operating loss that can be carried forward, if unused, would expire in 2031.
889900_13_ITEM15_P156_S4	The state net operating losses that can be carried forward, if unused, are scheduled to expire as follows: 2014 $4.1 million; 2015 $12.9 million; 2016 $8.3 million; 2028 $14.5 million; 2029 $29.8 million; 2030 $17.1 million and 2031 $82.3 million.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S1	The Company has established a policy to account for interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as operating expenses.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the tax years ended December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2011 are open for examination by U.S. taxing authorities.

889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S4	On January 1, 2010, the Company converted its Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S5	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S6	As a result of the above conversion, the Company s Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S7	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company has elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intends to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S8	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $27.8 million as of December 31, 2012.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S9	The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $4.2 million, net of available foreign tax credits.
889900_13_ITEM15_P157_S10	This liability would be recognized if the Company received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.
889900_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for all eligible employees.

889900_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company s revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three business segments: (i) contract drilling of oil and natural gas wells, (ii) pressure pumping services and (iii) the investment, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	Each of these segments represents a distinct type of business.
889900_13_ITEM15_P159_S2	These segments have separate management teams which report to the Company s chief operating decision maker.
889900_13_ITEM15_P159_S3	The results of operations in these segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of determining resource allocation and assessing performance.
889900_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	As discussed in Note 2, in January 2010, the Company exited the drilling and completion fluids services business which previously was reported as a business segment.

889900_13_ITEM15_P163_S1	Pressure pumping services are primarily well stimulation and cementing for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	Well stimulation involves processes inside a well designed to enhance the flow of oil, natural gas, or other desired substances from the well.
889900_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	Cementing is the process of inserting material between the hole and the pipe to center and stabilize the pipe in the hole.
889900_13_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company owns and invests in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.

889900_13_ITEM15_P172_S1	The concentration is somewhat mitigated by the diversification of customers for which the Company provides services.
889900_13_ITEM15_P172_S2	As is general industry practice, the Company typically does not require customers to provide collateral.
889900_13_ITEM15_P172_S3	No significant losses from individual customers were experienced during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.

889900_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	Exhibit 32.1 CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. SECTION 1350, AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 906 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 NOT FILED PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 In connection with the Annual Report of Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2012, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), William Andrew Hendricks, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, and John E. Vollmer III, Chief Financial Officer, of the Company, each certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to his knowledge:
889900_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
889900_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.

889900_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Prices are affected by factors such as:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Declines in the market prices of natural gas and oil caused our customers to significantly reduce their drilling activities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and drilling activities remained low throughout 2009.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Drilling activities increased in 2010 as did the prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The increased drilling activity was largely attributable to increased development of unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and an improvement in the price of oil.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Drilling for oil and liquids rich targets continued to increase in 2011 as oil averaged $94.86 per barrel for the year (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Natural gas prices decreased in 2011 to an average of $4.00 per Mcf (Henry Hub spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	This decrease continued into 2012 where natural gas prices fell below $2.00 per Mcf in April and averaged $2.75 per Mcf for the year, resulting in continued low levels of drilling activity for natural gas in 2012.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The increase in drilling activity in oil rich basins absorbed some of the decrease in demand for natural gas drilling activities in 2012.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	During 2013, natural gas prices averaged $3.73 per Mcf, and oil prices averaged $97.91 per barrel, and demand for natural gas drilling activities continued to decline.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States during the last decade has significantly contributed to excess capacity in total available drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result of decreased drilling activity and excess capacity, our average number of rigs operating has declined from historic highs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Low market prices for oil and natural gas would likely result in lower demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets may result in reduced access to financing by our customers and reduced demand for our services.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	construction of new technology drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Construction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and there has been a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment across the industry.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As a result of low natural gas prices and the construction of new equipment, there is currently an excess of pressure pumping equipment available.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In circumstances of excess capacity, providers of pressure pumping services have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Shortages, Delays in Delivery and Interruptions in Supply of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S9	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	For example, we generally maintain a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability and automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S9	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S10	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S13	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S14	New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May be Necessary to Remain Competitive in our Industry.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S15	The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S16	Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S17	Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S18	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P17_S19	Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements in competitors equipment could make our equipment less competitive.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we are not successful in building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment or upgrading our existing rigs and pressure pumping equipment in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose market share.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $946 million.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to cancel or negotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In addition, the renegotiation or termination of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The Oil Service Business Sectors in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	The land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	At times, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	The ability to move drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S11	We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue to be intense due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S12	As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Reliance on Management, Competition for Experienced Personnel and Rising Labor Costs Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S14	We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S15	The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S16	In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S17	In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S18	During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S19	An inability to obtain or attract and retain qualified personnel and increases in wage rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S20	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S21	In 2013, we received approximately 46% of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest customers and approximately 29% of our consolidated operating revenues from our five largest customers.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S22	During 2013, one customer accounted for approximately $286 million or 10.5% of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S23	These revenues were earned in both our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P20_S24	The loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including NSPS to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and NESHAPS to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, gas wells are now required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	These rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Both the EPA and the U.S. Congress are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing activities and soil or ground water contamination.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S10	As part of their respective studies, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment and the EPA each sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S11	We have responded to each of the inquiries.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S12	In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S13	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S14	Certain states where we operate, including Texas, have adopted or are considering similar disclosure legislation.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S15	For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S16	In addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act s Underground Injection Control Program and is developing final guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P26_S17	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For example, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The EPA released a progress report on December 21, 2012 outlining work currently underway and is expected to release a draft final report in 2014.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, the EPA announced on October 20, 2011 that it is launching a study of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose pretreatment regulations in 2014.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( PSD ) and Title V programs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	This final rule tailors the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Legal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on our Business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S7	The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S10	International Uncertainties, and Laws Related to International Opportunities Could Adversely Affect our Opportunities and Future Business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P31_S11	We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social unrest, strikes, terrorism, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Because of the impact of local laws, our future international operations, if any, in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Some of the parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes, term loan facility and, from time to time, revolving credit facility.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	At December 31, 2013, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $92.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.50%.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S5	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2013 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $900,000.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S9	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S10	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S11	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S12	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_14_ITEM1A_P39_S13	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is in leased office space and is located at 450 Gears Road, Suite 500, Houston, Texas.
889900_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that address is (281) 765-7100.
889900_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our primary administrative office, which is located in Snyder, Texas, is owned and includes approximately 37,000 square feet of office and storage space.
889900_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our drilling services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	Pumping Our pressure pumping services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.
889900_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Working Interests Our interests in oil and natural gas properties are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We own our administrative offices in Snyder, Texas, as well as several of our other facilities.
889900_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also lease a number of facilities, and we do not believe that any one of the leased facilities is individually material to our operations.
889900_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our needs.
889900_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	Company tolerated a hostile work environment for employees based on national origin and race.
889900_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The cause findings also allege, among other things, failure to promote, subjecting employees to adverse employment terms and conditions and retaliation.
889900_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company and the EEOC are engaged in the statutory conciliation process.
889900_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	If such conciliation process is unsuccessful, the Company believes that litigation will ensue.
889900_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company intends to defend itself vigorously and, based on the information available to the Company at this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this matter.
889900_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	Other than the matter described above, we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business.
889900_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	We do not believe that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

889900_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included as Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report.
889900_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	Due to the sale of our drilling and completion fluids business in January 2010 and the sale of our electric wireline business in January 2011, the results of operations for those businesses have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
889900_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management Overview We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.
889900_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition to these services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	We acquired an electric wireline business on October 1, 2010 and sold the business on January 27, 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Due to our exit from the electric wireline business, we have presented the results of that business as discontinued operations in this Report.
889900_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 279 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and natural gas prices have been low in recent years.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Activity in our drilling business decreased in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2013, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 192, as compared to an average of 206 drilling rigs operating during the same period in 2012.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we have completed 124 new APEX rigs and made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	We have plans to complete 20 additional new APEX rigs in 2014.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S6	In connection with horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S7	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 763,000 hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_14_ITEM7_P2_S8	This is a net increase of approximately 610,000 horsepower since the end of 2009.
889900_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Low natural gas prices and the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace has led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our backlog as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $946 million.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	We expect approximately $660 million of our backlog to be realized in 2014.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the day rate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	For contracts for which we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the day rate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.
889900_14_ITEM7_P4_S7	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	For the three years ended December 31, 2013, our operating revenues from continuing operations consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	During 2013, our average number of rigs operating was 184 in the United States and 8 in Canada compared to 214 in the United States and 7 in Canada in 2012 and 205 in the United States and 11 in Canada in 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	revenue per operating day was $24,020 in 2013 compared to $22,540 in 2012 and $21,200 in 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We had consolidated net income of $188 million for 2013 compared to $299 million for 2012.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The decrease in consolidated net income was primarily due to lower revenue as a result of fewer rigs operating, lower profitability on pressure pumping revenues, higher depreciation expense and a gain on assets disposals in 2012 with no similar gain in 2013.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense for 2013 includes a charge of $7.9 million related to removing 48 rigs from our marketable fleet.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	It also includes a charge of $29.9 million related to 55 mechanical rigs that were not under contract.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	Although these 55 rigs remain marketable, we have lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_14_ITEM7_P6_S8	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Natural gas prices and our monthly average number of rigs operating have declined from recent highs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	In December 2013, our average number of rigs operating was 187 in the United States and 9 in Canada.
889900_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.
889900_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	In connection with our ongoing planning process, we evaluated our then-current fleet of marketable drilling rigs in 2013, 2012 and 2011 and identified 48, 36 and 53 rigs, during each of those years, respectively, that we determined would no longer be marketed as rigs based on our assessment of estimated expenditures to bring these rigs into condition to operate in the current environment, as well as our assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	were transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The remaining components of these rigs were retired.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The net book values of these assets of $7.9 million in 2013, $5.2 million in 2012 and $15.7 million in 2011 were expensed in our consolidated statements of operations.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	In 2013, due to a recent shift in customer demand away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations a charge of $29.9 million related to 55 mechanical rigs that were not under contract.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although these 55 rigs remain marketable, we have lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	There were no similar charges in 2012 or 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S6	We also evaluate our fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S7	The net book value of these assets of $7.3 million was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S8	There were no similar charges in 2013 or 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S9	In light of the levels of activity and revenue per operating day experienced by us and our peers in 2013, 2012 and 2011, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during these years with respect to our contract drilling segment as a whole which would indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in that segment may not be recoverable.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S10	We also concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to our pressure pumping segment in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
889900_14_ITEM7_P16_S11	Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.
889900_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	We evaluate goodwill at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.
889900_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	We currently have goodwill in our contract drilling and pressure pumping operating segments.
889900_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	From time to time, we may perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing a qualitative assessment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2012, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2012 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S5	We also considered the then current and expected levels of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S6	Additionally, operating results for 2012 and forecasted operating results for 2013 were also taken into account.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S7	Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from our 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S8	We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2013.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S9	In completing the first step of the analysis, we used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S10	In developing this fair value estimate, we applied key assumptions including an assumed discount rate of 11.87% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed discount rate of 12.40% for the pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_14_ITEM7_P20_S11	An assumed long-term growth rate of 3.00% was used for both reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	results of the first step of the impairment test in 2013, we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted primarily from low natural gas prices.
889900_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	In the event that market conditions weaken, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	All of the wells we drilled in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on our expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field and the net future cash inflows from developing and operating these fields.
889900_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	$1.9 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We currently have exposure to interest rate market risk associated with any borrowings that we have under our term credit facility or our revolving credit facility.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	At December 31, 2013, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $92.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.50%.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	The interest rate on the borrowing outstanding under our term credit facility is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2013 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $900,000.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.

889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_14_ITEM15_P41_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_14_ITEM15_P42_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889900_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	The effects of exchange rate changes are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity.
889900_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	A summary of the significant accounting policies follows: Management estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	All of the wells the Company drilled in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount.
889900_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses existing in the Company s accounts receivable.
889900_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at least quarterly.
889900_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability.
889900_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Account balances, when determined to be uncollectable, are charged against the allowance.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Inventories Inventories consist primarily of sand and other products to be used in conjunction with the Company s pressure pumping activities.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	The inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in, first-out method.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S4	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_14_ITEM15_P57_S5	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.
889900_14_ITEM15_P60_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_14_ITEM15_P61_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_14_ITEM15_P61_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on management s expectations of future commodity prices over the life of the respective field and the net future cash inflows from developing and operating these fields.
889900_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company reviews unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company s impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as management s intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company assesses impairment of its goodwill at least annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.

889900_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Net income per common share The Company provides a dual presentation of its net income per common share in its consolidated statements of operations: Basic net income per common share ( Basic EPS ) and diluted net income per common share ( Diluted EPS ).
889900_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate income from continuing operations per share, loss from discontinued operations per share and net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands, except per share amounts): Income taxes The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
889900_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_14_ITEM15_P68_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The Company s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses.
889900_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_14_ITEM15_P71_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 10).
889900_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires additional disclosures regarding reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
889900_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	This requirement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012, and became effective for the Company in the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
889900_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company s disclosures included in its consolidated financial statements.

889900_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Universal Wireline, Inc. was formed in 2010 to acquire an electric wireline business.
889900_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The results of operations of this business have been presented as results of discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements.
889900_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the assets to be disposed of were classified as held for sale.
889900_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the assets to be disposed of were recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell resulting in a charge of $2.2 million.
889900_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	Due to the fact that the carrying value of the assets had been adjusted to net realizable value, no significant additional gain or loss was recognized in connection with the sale.
889900_14_ITEM15_P77_S2	Summarized operating results from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 are shown below (in thousands):

889900_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	In light of levels of activity and revenue per operating day experienced by the Company and its peers in 2011, 2012 and 2013, management concluded that no triggering event had occurred in 2011, 2012 or 2013 with respect to its contract drilling segment as a whole.
889900_14_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company also concluded that no triggering event occurred with respect to its pressure pumping segment in 2011, 2012 or 2013.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets at the end of each quarter due to revisions in its oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be separated from other long-lived assets.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company performs the first step of its impairment assessments by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each long-lived asset or asset group to its respective carrying value.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S3	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S4	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S5	The Company recorded impairment charges of $4.0 million, $1.9 million and $3.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to its oil and natural gas properties.
889900_14_ITEM15_P81_S6	The Company determined the fair value of the impaired assets using internally developed unobservable inputs including future pricing and reserves (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	well as its assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this expected demand.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	The components comprising these rigs were evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs were transferred to other rigs or to its yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	The remaining components of these rigs were retired.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	The net book values of these assets of $7.9 million in 2013, $5.2 million in 2012 and $15.7 million in 2011 were expensed in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S4	In 2013, due to a recent shift in customer demand away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, the Company recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a charge of $29.9 million related to 55 mechanical rigs that were not under contract.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S5	Although these 55 rigs remain marketable, the Company has lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S6	There were no similar charges in 2012 or 2011.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S7	The Company also evaluates its fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S8	The net book value of these assets of $7.3 million was expensed in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.
889900_14_ITEM15_P83_S9	There were no similar charges in 2013 or 2011.

889900_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill by operating segment as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and changes for the years then ended are as follows (in thousands): There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2013 or 2012.
889900_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	From time to time, the Company may perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing a qualitative assessment.
889900_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_14_ITEM15_P87_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	the Company s reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	In making this determination, the Company considered the continued demand experienced during 2012 for its services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company also considered the then current and expected levels of commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas, which influence its overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S3	Additionally, operating results for 2012 and forecasted operating results for 2013 were also taken into account.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S4	The Company s overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of the Company s reporting units over their carrying values and lack of significant changes in the key assumptions from its 2010 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S5	The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment of its goodwill as of December 31, 2013.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S6	In completing the first step of the analysis, the Company used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S7	In developing this fair value estimate, the Company applied key assumptions including an assumed discount rate of 11.87% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed discount rate of 12.40% for the pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S8	An assumed long-term growth rate of 3.00% was used for both reporting units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P88_S9	Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2013, the Company concluded that no impairment was indicated in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company has undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade its fleet of equipment and believes that it is well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted primarily from low natural gas prices.
889900_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	In the event that market conditions weaken, the Company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of a pressure pumping business.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	As a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded intangible assets related to a non-compete agreement and the customer relationships acquired.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S2	These intangible assets were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S3	The non-compete agreement had a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S4	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S5	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_14_ITEM15_P90_S6	Amortization expense of $350,000, $467,000 and $467,000 was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, associated with the non-compete agreement.
889900_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The value of the customer relationships was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model to determine the present value of the projected cash flows associated with the customers in place at the time of the acquisition and taking into account a contributory asset charge.
889900_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The resulting intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years.
889900_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	Amortization expense of $3.6 million was recorded in each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, associated with customer relationships.
889900_14_ITEM15_P91_S3	For both the non-compete agreement and the customer relationships, the Company concluded no triggering events necessitating an impairment assessment had occurred in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S3	The performance goals for the 2009 Performance Units were tied to the Company s total shareholder return for the performance period as compared to total shareholder return for a peer group determined by the Compensation Committee.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S4	These goals were considered to be market conditions under the relevant accounting standards and the market conditions were factored into the determination of the fair value of the performance units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S5	Generally, the recipients would receive a target payment if the Company s total shareholder return was positive and, when compared to the peer group, was at or above the 50 th percentile but less than the 75 th percentile and two times the target if at the 75 th percentile or higher.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S6	If the Company s total shareholder return was positive, and, when compared to the peer group, was at or above the 25 th percentile but less than the 50 th percentile, the recipients would only receive one-half of the target payment.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S7	The total target amount with respect to the 2009 Performance Units was approximately $3.4 million.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S8	Because the 2009 Performance Units were settled in cash at the end of the performance period, they were accounted for as liability awards and the Company s pro-rated obligation was measured at estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_14_ITEM15_P143_S9	The performance period ended on March 31, 2012 and the Company s total shareholder return was at the 46 th percentile.

889900_14_ITEM15_P144_S3	The performance goals for the Stock-Settled Performance Units are tied to the Company s total shareholder return for the performance period as compared to total shareholder return for a peer group determined by the Compensation Committee.
889900_14_ITEM15_P144_S4	These goals are considered to be market conditions under the relevant accounting standards and the market conditions are factored into the determination of the fair value of the respective performance units.
889900_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	Generally, the recipients will receive a target number of shares if the Company s total shareholder return is positive and, when compared to the peer group, is at the 50 th percentile and two times the target if at the 75 th percentile or higher.
889900_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	If the Company s total shareholder return is positive, and, when compared to the peer group, is at the 25 th percentile, the recipients will only receive one-half of the target number of shares.
889900_14_ITEM15_P145_S2	The grant of shares when achievement is between the 25 th and 75 th percentile will be determined on a pro-rata basis.
889900_14_ITEM15_P145_S3	The performance period for the 2010 Stock-Settled Performance Units ended on March 31, 2013, and the Company s total shareholder return was at the 93 rd percentile.

889900_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	The total target number of shares with respect to the Stock-Settled Performance Units is set forth below:
889900_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	Because the Stock-Settled Performance Units are stock-settled awards, they are accounted for as equity awards and measured at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
889900_14_ITEM15_P147_S1	The fair value of the Stock-Settled Performance Units is set forth below (in thousands):

889900_14_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_14_ITEM15_P155_S1	The permanent difference for 2011 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company had a tax loss in 2011.
889900_14_ITEM15_P155_S2	The permanent difference for 2012 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company did not have taxable income in 2012 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_14_ITEM15_P155_S3	The permanent difference for 2013 includes a deduction of $10.0 million as the Company fully utilized its remaining net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_14_ITEM15_P156_S0	The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes therein were as follows (in thousands):
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S3	The Company expects the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013 and 2012 to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities and the generation of taxable income; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary.
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S4	Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of various allowance accounts and tax-deferred expenses expected to generate future tax benefits of approximately $34.4 million.
889900_14_ITEM15_P157_S5	Other deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of the tax effect of receivables from insurance companies and tax-deferred income not yet recognized for tax purposes.
889900_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	For income tax purposes, the Company has approximately $177 million of state net operating losses that can be carried forward as of December 31, 2013.

889900_14_ITEM15_P159_S4	On January 1, 2010, the Company converted its Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_14_ITEM15_P159_S5	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_14_ITEM15_P159_S6	As a result of the above conversion, the Company s Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_14_ITEM15_P159_S7	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company has elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intends to do so for the foreseeable future.

889900_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	The SEC maintains an internet site ( www.sec.gov ) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
889900_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	We own and operate in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company was formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Patterson Energy, Inc. and UTI Energy Corp. merged in 2001 to form Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.
889900_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2008, the corporate headquarters was moved from Snyder, Texas to Houston, Texas.
889900_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States, and western and northern Canada.
889900_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 239 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	A drilling rig is considered marketable at a point in time if it is operating or can be made ready to operate without significant capital expenditures.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components that support our ongoing drilling operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.0 million hydraulic horsepower to provide these services.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment, including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S7	We also own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S8	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S9	Recent Developments Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1_P4_S10	The closing price of oil was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, as low as $44.08 per barrel in late January 2015 and around $50 per barrel during the first week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	As a result of the decline in oil prices, our industry is now experiencing a severe downturn.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	Market conditions remain very dynamic and are changing quickly.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Although the magnitude as well as the duration of this downturn are not yet known, we believe that 2015 will be a challenging year for our industry.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	We believe the vast majority of exploration and production companies, including our customers, have significantly reduced their 2015 capital spending plans.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	The initial impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by the published rig counts which have declined more 25% since their recent peak in October 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S5	Our rig count has also declined.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S6	During October 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States was as high as 214, and as of February 10, 2015 we had 173 drilling rigs operating in the United States.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S7	We have received indications of customers intent to early terminate a number of term contracts and many of our drilling customers are seeking price reductions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S8	We expect the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States to decline at least another 20% during the next 90 days.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S9	Our pressure pumping business is also beginning to see the effects of reduced spending by customers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P5_S10	Some previously scheduled pressure pumping jobs have been cancelled or deferred and many customers are also seeking price reductions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2015, we have continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate slightly higher than the reduction in our rig count.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	We have also reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	Along with other reductions, we now plan to only build new drilling rigs that are currently committed under term contracts.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S4	We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S5	We expect that our term contract coverage and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs should position us to weather this downturn.
889900_15_ITEM1_P6_S6	In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, however, we may experience further, significant declines on both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing, and on pressure pumping activity and pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
889900_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	oil and natural gas exploration and production.
889900_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	All of our industry segments had operating profits in 2012 and 2013.
889900_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2014, our contract drilling services and our pressure pumping services segments had operating profits and our oil and natural gas exploration and production segment had an operating loss.
889900_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had 239 marketable land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	10 in western and northern Canada.
889900_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our marketable drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 10,000 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Of these drilling rigs, 195 are electric rigs and 44 are mechanical rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines (the sole energy source for a mechanical rig) into electricity to power the rig.
889900_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as replacement parts for marketable rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs to ensure that our drilling equipment is competitive.
889900_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	We have spent over $2.0 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.
889900_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	During fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, we spent approximately $772 million, $505 million and $745 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S4	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S5	During 2014, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 20 days.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S6	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S7	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S8	We believe that our drilling contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S9	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S10	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S11	The customer supervises the drilling of the well.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S12	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_15_ITEM1_P18_S13	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	All of the wells we drilled in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were under daywork contracts.
889900_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	From time to time more than five years ago, we contracted to drill some wells to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot (on a footage basis) or for a fixed fee (on a turnkey basis).
889900_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	We generally assume greater operational and economic risk drilling on a turnkey basis than on a footage basis and greater operational and economic risk drilling on a footage basis than on a daywork basis.
889900_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	While conventional wells remain an important source of oil and natural gas, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	To address our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	APEX 1500 rigs are 1,500 horsepower electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other highly automated pipe handling equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	APEX 1000 rigs are 1,000 horsepower electric rigs with advanced technology equipment similar to the APEX 1500 rigs, but with a more compact design to fit on smaller locations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	APEX WALKING rigs are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	Many APEX 1500 and APEX 1000 rigs have also been equipped with walking systems as noted below.
889900_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our drilling fleet was comprised of the following:
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	At December 31, 2014, we owned and operated 286 trucks and 323 trailers used to rig down, transport and rig up our drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	We perform repair and/or overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (Southwest Region) and the Appalachian region (Northeast Region).
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S5	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_15_ITEM1_P27_S6	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that our pressure pumping contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations; however, each pressure pumping contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrogen fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 1.0 million hydraulic horsepower as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2014 included:
889900_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that do not cover all of our required supply and that sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Interests We own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in producing regions of Texas and New Mexico.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	The customers of each of our contract drilling and pressure pumping business segments are oil and natural gas operators.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	Our customer base includes both major and independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S5	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2014, we received approximately 41% from our ten largest customers, 28% from our five largest customers and 16% from our two largest customers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S6	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P32_S7	During 2014, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	The contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand.
889900_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the places in which we operate have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	Any suspension or moratorium of the services we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_15_ITEM1_P36_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	liability for drainage into such waters.
889900_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities.
889900_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
889900_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees.
889900_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens.
889900_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
889900_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	In Canada, a variety of federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S5	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S6	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P47_S7	For more information, please refer to our discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution and reservoir damage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S9	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customer to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_15_ITEM1_P48_S11	Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	to our customers by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S5	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S6	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S7	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S8	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S9	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S10	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S11	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S12	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S13	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S14	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S15	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S16	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S17	We had approximately 7,900 full-time employees as of February 10, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S18	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S19	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_15_ITEM1_P49_S20	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.
889900_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual spring thaw.
889900_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Additionally, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers capital expenditure budgets are depleted.
889900_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
889900_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Prices are affected by factors such as:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, oil prices averaged $99.96 per barrel, natural gas prices averaged $4.59 per Mcf and demand for drilling activities increased.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2014, drilling activity slowed as oil prices averaged $73.16 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $3.80 per Mcf.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Drilling activity has significantly decreased since December 31, 2014, as oil prices averaged $47.22 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $2.99 per Mcf during January 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and given current oil pricing and existing market trends, we expect our average number of rigs operating to continue to decline through at least the first quarter of 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Continued low market prices for oil and natural gas will likely result in decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and reduced demand for our services.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade, including a downturn that started late in 2014.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Construction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and there has been a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment across the industry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result of low oil and natural gas prices and the construction of new equipment, there is currently an excess of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In circumstances of excess capacity, providers of contract drilling and pressure pumping services have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	construction of new technology drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Shortages, Delays in Delivery and Interruptions in Supply of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S13	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S14	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S15	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S16	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S17	If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S18	New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in our Industry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S19	The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S20	Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S21	Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S22	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P17_S23	Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements in competitors equipment could make our equipment less competitive.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we are not successful in building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment or upgrading our existing rigs and pressure pumping equipment in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose market share.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	One or more technologies that we implement in the future may not work as we expect, and we may be adversely affected.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	As of December 31, 2014, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $1.5 billion.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to cancel or negotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, the renegotiation or termination of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The Oil Service Business Sectors in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	The land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	At times, particularly in low commodity price environments, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S9	The ability to move drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S10	We believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue to be intense due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S11	As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S12	Reliance on Management and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S13	The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S14	In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S15	In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S16	During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S17	The loss of key employees, the failure to obtain or attract and retain qualified personnel and increased wage rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S18	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S19	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2014, we received approximately 41% from our ten largest customers, 28% from our five largest customers and 16% from our two largest customers.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S20	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P19_S21	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAPS ) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, gas wells are now required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	These rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In 2012, seven states sued the EPA to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether setting standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources is appropriate and, if so, to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and natural gas sources.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In April 2014, the EPA released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In January 2015, EPA announced plans to issue a proposed rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	For example, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S6	As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S7	We have responded to the inquiry.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S8	The EPA released a progress report on December 21, 2012 outlining work currently underway and is expected to release a draft final report in early 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P27_S9	This and other ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) or other regulatory mechanism.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Regulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain diesel fuel under the SWDA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Finally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	New York announced in December 2014 that it will ban high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Voters in the city of Denton, Texas also recently approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S4	These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P31_S7	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( PSD ) and Title V programs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This final rule tailors the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Legal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on our Business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Political, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect our Opportunities and Future Business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P35_S6	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Some of the parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S7	The occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes, term loan facility and, from time to time, revolving credit facility.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	At December 31, 2014, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had $303 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.65% and $82.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.50%.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility as of December 31, 2014 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $3.8 million.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S9	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S11	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S12	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S13	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_15_ITEM1A_P40_S14	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is in leased office space and is located at 450 Gears Road, Suite 500, Houston, Texas.
889900_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that address is (281) 765-7100.
889900_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our primary administrative office, which is located in Snyder, Texas, is owned and includes approximately 37,000 square feet of office and storage space.
889900_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our drilling services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	Pumping Our pressure pumping services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.
889900_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Working Interests Our interests in oil and natural gas properties are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own our administrative offices in Snyder, Texas, as well as several of our other facilities.
889900_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	We also lease a number of facilities, and we do not believe that any one of the leased facilities is individually material to our operations.
889900_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our needs.
889900_15_ITEM2_P2_S3	We incorporate by reference in response to this item the information set forth in Item 1 of this Report and the information set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
889900_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	In October 2014, we were notified by EPA region 6 that it intends to seek civil penalties for alleged RCRA administrative violations at a former facility of one of our subsidiaries in Midland, Texas.
889900_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The EPA subsequently alleged RCRA administrative violations at other facilities of that subsidiary and are seeking an aggregate monetary penalty of approximately $1.1 million.
889900_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are in negotiations with the EPA regarding the scope and amount of any potential settlement.
889900_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_15_ITEM3_P0_S4	Other than the matters described above, the Company is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business; the Company does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and is quoted under the symbol PTEN.

889900_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	(c) Dividends We paid cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 as follows:
889900_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	On February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 25, 2015 to holders of record as of March 11, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our credit facilities and other factors.
889900_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	The table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases of our common stock made by us during the quarter ended December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	On September 9, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	(e) Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative stockholder return of our common stock for the period from December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2014, with the cumulative total return of the Standard Poors 500 Stock Index, the Standard Poors MidCap Index, the Oilfield Service Index and a peer group determined by us.
889900_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	Our peer group consists of Helmerich Payne, Inc., Nabors Industries, Ltd., Pioneer Energy Services Corp. and Precision Drilling Corp.
889900_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	Nabors Industries, Ltd. also is a provider of pressure pumping services.

889900_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	January 2015 and around $50 per barrel during the first week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	As a result of the decline in oil prices, our industry is now experiencing a severe downturn.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Market conditions remain very dynamic and are changing quickly.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Although the magnitude as well as the duration of this downturn are not yet known, we believe that 2015 will be a challenging year for our industry.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe the vast majority of exploration and production companies, including our customers, have significantly reduced their 2015 capital spending plans.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	The initial impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by the published rig counts which have declined more 25% since their recent peak in October 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our rig count has also declined.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S6	During October 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States was as high as 214, and as of February 10, 2015 we had 173 drilling rigs operating in the United States.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S7	We have received indications of customers intent to early terminate a number of term contracts and many of our drilling customers are seeking price reductions.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S8	We expect the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States to decline at least another 20% during the next 90 days.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S9	Our pressure pumping business is also beginning to see the effects of reduced spending by customers.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S10	Some previously scheduled pressure pumping jobs have been cancelled or deferred and many customers are also seeking price reductions.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S11	In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S12	In 2015, we have continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate slightly higher than the reduction in our rig count.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S13	We have also reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S14	Along with other reductions, we now plan to only build new drilling rigs that are currently committed under term contracts.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S15	We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S16	We expect that our term contract coverage and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs should position us to weather this downturn.
889900_15_ITEM7_P1_S17	In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, however, we may experience further, significant declines on both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing, and on pressure pumping activity and pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.
889900_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition to these services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 239 land-based drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, and oil and natural gas prices are volatile.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The closing price of oil was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, as low as $44.08 per barrel in late January 2015 and around $50 per barrel during the first week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration).
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	In response, many of our customers have announced significant reductions in their 2015 capital spending budgets.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	During October 2014, the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States was as high as 214, and as of February 10, 2015 we had 173 drilling rigs operating in the United States.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	We expect the number of our drilling rigs operating in the United States to continue to decline at least through the first quarter of 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S6	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S7	As of December 31, 2014, we have completed 145 new APEX rigs and made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S8	We have plans to complete 16 additional new APEX rigs in 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S9	In connection with horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S10	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.0 million hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_15_ITEM7_P4_S11	This is a net increase of approximately 866,000 horsepower since the end of 2009.
889900_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	In recent years, low natural gas prices and the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our backlog as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $1.5 billion.
889900_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We expect approximately $953 million of our backlog to be realized in 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	For contracts for which we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.
889900_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	For the three years ended December 31, 2014, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	During 2014, our average number of rigs operating was 203 in the United States and 8 in Canada compared to 184 in the United States and 8 in Canada in 2013 and 214 in the United States and 7 in Canada in 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our average revenue per operating day was $23,880 in 2014 compared to $24,020 in 2013 and $22,540 in 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	We had consolidated net income of $163 million for 2014 compared to $188 million for 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	This decrease in consolidated net income was due to a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of 55 mechanical drilling rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical rig fleet.
889900_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	Also, revenues in 2013 included early termination revenues totaling approximately $65.2 million related to early contract terminations.
889900_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Oil and natural gas prices and our monthly average number of rigs operating have declined from recent highs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	In December 2014, our average number of rigs operating was 208 in the United States and 8 in Canada.
889900_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	In January 2015, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 198.
889900_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The remaining components of these rigs are retired.
889900_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	We recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	In 2012, we identified 36 rigs that it determined would no longer be marketed and recorded a charge of $5.2 million related to the retirement of these rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	We also evaluate our fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	The net book value of these assets of $7.3 million was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations.
889900_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	In light of the significant decline in oil and natural gas commodity prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015, we deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	With respect to these assets, we estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the assets, and determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets.
889900_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Based on this assessment, no impairment was indicated.
889900_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	Impairment considerations related to our oil and natural gas segment are discussed below.
889900_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We evaluate goodwill at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be the same as our operating segments.
889900_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	We currently have goodwill in our contract drilling and pressure pumping operating segments.
889900_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	From time to time, we may perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing a qualitative assessment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	In completing the first step of the analysis, we used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	In developing this fair value estimate, we applied key assumptions including an assumed discount rate of 11.87% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed discount rate of 12.40% for the pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	An assumed long-term growth rate of 3.00% was used for both reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S7	Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2013, we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S8	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S9	In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S10	We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S11	Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S12	Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values from our 2013 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S13	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells.
889900_15_ITEM7_P26_S14	In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	All of the wells we drilled in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Impairment expense related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $20.9 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity as of December 31, 2014 included approximately $341 million in working capital and approximately $157 million available under our $500 million revolving credit facility.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we received an $82 million federal income tax refund related to 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The refund, along with other cash generated from our cash management efforts, were used to repay $103 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	As of February 10, 2015, availability under the revolving credit facility was $260 million.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	In an attempt to further increase availability under our revolving credit facility, we are working with a lender to move $39.8 million of letters of credit currently outstanding under our revolving credit facility into a new separate facility to be used only for letters of credit.
889900_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	We believe our current liquidity together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to build new equipment, make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends.
889900_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	likely require additional debt or equity financing.
889900_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had working capital of $341 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $43 million, compared to working capital of $454 million and cash and cash equivalents of $250 million at December 31, 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	During 2014, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	$33.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	During 2014, we used $176 million to acquire pressure pumping operations, $58.3 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $13.6 million to repurchase shares of our common stock, $10.0 million to repay long-term debt and $1.1 billion:
889900_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a working interest basis.
889900_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2014 as follows:
889900_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	On February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 25, 2015 to holders of record as of March 11, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our credit facilities and other factors.
889900_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	On August 1, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $250 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	On July 25, 2012, our Board of Directors terminated the remaining authority under the 2007 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $150 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	On September 6, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors terminated any remaining authority under the 2012 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of the Company s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the new stock buyback program.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Shares purchased under a buyback program are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	We acquired shares of stock from employees during 2014, 2013 and 2012 that are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	These shares were acquired at fair market value.
889900_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan ) or the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan ) and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.
889900_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Treasury stock acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	On September 27, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ).
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The Credit Agreement is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Credit Agreement replaced a previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $500 million outstanding at any time.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $150 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $40 million, in each case outstanding at any time.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	The term loan facility provides for a loan of $100 million, which was drawn on December 24, 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S6	The term loan facility is payable in quarterly principal installments which commenced December 27, 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P48_S7	The installment amounts vary from 1.25% of the original principal amount for each of the first four quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal amount for each of the subsequent eight quarterly installments, 5.00% of the original principal amount for the subsequent four quarterly installments and 13.75% of the original principal amount for the final four quarterly installments.
889900_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility and/or the term loan facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $700 million.
889900_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The maturity date under the Credit Agreement is September 27, 2017 for both the revolving facility and the term facility.
889900_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.
889900_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.25% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.25% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.
889900_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the credit facility is 0.50%.
889900_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Each of our U.S. subsidiaries, other than one domestic holding company and certain immaterial subsidiaries, has unconditionally guaranteed all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and us arising under the Credit Agreement and other loan documents.
889900_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Such guarantees also cover obligations of us and any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.
889900_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 45%.
889900_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
889900_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.
889900_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Events of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to insolvency and bankruptcy such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had $82.5 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.50% and $303 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a weighted interest rate of 2.65%.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	We had $39.8 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of approximately $157 million at that date.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Series A Notes ) in a private placement.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	We will pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S6	The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S7	On June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amounts of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the Series B Notes ) in a private placement.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S8	The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum.

889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S10	The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S11	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S12	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our existing domestic subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S13	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole premium as specified in the note purchase agreements.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S14	We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S15	In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.
889900_15_ITEM7_P57_S16	If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.
889900_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.
889900_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	We also must not permit the interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.
889900_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Events of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
889900_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	In addition, if the Company defaults in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.
889900_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2014, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $39.8 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.
889900_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	As of December 31, 2014, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.
889900_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had commitments to purchase approximately $512 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors.
889900_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	These agreements expire in 2016, 2017 and 2018.
889900_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	required to be purchased during 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.
889900_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	In November 2011, our pressure pumping business entered into an agreement with a proppant vendor to advance up to $12.0 million to such vendor to finance its construction of certain processing facilities.
889900_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	This advance is secured by the underlying processing facilities and bears interest at an annual rate of 5.0%.
889900_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Repayment of the advance is to be made through discounts applied to purchases from the vendor and repayment of all amounts advanced must be made no later than October 1, 2017.
889900_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	As of December 31, 2014, advances of approximately $11.8 million had been made under this agreement and repayments of approximately $8.6 million had been received resulting in a balance outstanding of approximately $3.2 million.
889900_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	In May 2013, the EEOC notified us of cause findings related to certain of our employment practices.
889900_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The cause findings relate to allegations that we tolerated a hostile work environment for employees based on national origin and race.
889900_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The cause findings also allege, among other things, failure to promote, subjecting employees to adverse employment terms and conditions and retaliation.
889900_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	We and the EEOC engaged in the statutory conciliation process.
889900_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	In March 2014, the EEOC notified us that this matter will be forwarded to its legal unit for litigation review.
889900_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	In November 2014, we and the EEOC participated in a mediation to resolve the matter.
889900_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	If no resolution is reached, we believe that litigation will ensue, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
889900_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Based on the information available to us at this time, we do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this matter.
889900_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	In October 2014, we were notified by EPA Region 6 that it intends to seek civil penalties for alleged RCRA violations at a former facility on one of our subsidiaries in Midland, Texas.
889900_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The EPA subsequently alleged RCRA violations at other facilities of that subsidiary and are seeking an aggregate monetary penalty of approximately $1.1 million.
889900_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	We are in negotiations with the EPA regarding the scope and amount of any potential settlement.
889900_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
889900_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Trading and Investing We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts.
889900_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.

889900_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Results of Operations Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:
889900_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.
889900_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.
889900_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years has contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Also in recent years, customer demand has shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2014 and 2013 follows:
889900_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of an increase in the number of rigs operating.
889900_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Revenues in 2013 included approximately $65.2 million of early termination revenues.
889900_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2013 due to the early termination revenue.
889900_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	Capital expenditures were incurred in 2014 and 2013 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional equipment including top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	We recorded additional depreciation, amortization and impairment expense of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.
889900_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM7_P88_S4	Significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to add new rig capacity also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense.
889900_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in the size of our jobs and the size of our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our customers have continued the development of unconventional reservoirs resulting in an increase in larger multi-stage fracturing jobs associated therewith.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	In connection with the horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs, including the June 2014 acquisition of an East Texas-based pressure pumping operation and the October 2014 acquisition of a Texas-based pressure pumping operation.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	As a result, we have continued to experience an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fracturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S4	Additionally, the average size of the multi-stage fracturing jobs has increased.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S5	Average revenue per fracturing job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of this increase in the proportion of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs and the increased size of the jobs in 2014 as compared to 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P90_S6	Depreciation expense increased due to capital expenditures.
889900_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depletion and impairment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Oil revenues decreased as a result of lower average oil prices and lower production.
889900_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Natural gas and liquids revenue increased due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower production.
889900_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	Direct operating costs and depletion expense increased primarily due to the addition of new wells.
889900_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	Depletion and impairment expense in 2014 includes approximately $20.9 million of oil and natural gas property impairments, compared to approximately $4.0 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P92_S4	The impairment in 2014 is primarily the result of lower oil prices.
889900_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 increased primarily due to higher personnel costs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The net gain on the disposal of assets in 2014 resulted primarily from miscellaneous sales of drilling equipment and sales of certain oil and natural gas properties.
889900_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:

889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	In connection with the development of unconventional reservoirs, customers continued to increase the average size of the fracturing jobs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	As a result, we experienced an increase in the size of these multi-stage fracturing jobs resulting in higher revenues and costs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	Average revenue per fracturing job increased as a result of this increase in the larger multi-stage fracturing jobs in 2013 as compared to 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily as a result of increased amounts of materials and labor used on the larger multi-stage fracturing jobs.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S4	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense increased in 2013 due primarily to significant capital expenditures incurred to add capacity.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S5	In 2012, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses included approximately $7.3 million related to the retirement of certain pressure pumping equipment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P104_S6	There were no comparable charges in 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depletion and impairment.
889900_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Oil revenues decreased as a result of lower production partially offset by higher average oil prices.

889900_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense for 2013 increased primarily due to higher costs associated with stock-based compensation and expenses to evaluate and prepare for international growth opportunities.
889900_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	Selling, general and administrative expense in 2012 included a reduction in personnel costs related to the final determination of payouts under the 2009 Performance Unit Awards upon the completion of the performance period.
889900_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	There was no similar reduction in 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	The gain on the disposal of assets in 2012 includes a gain of approximately $22.6 million associated with the sale of our flowback operations and a $4.5 million gain from the auction sale of certain excess drilling assets.
889900_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	An additional provision for bad debts was recorded in 2012 with no similar increase in 2013.
889900_15_ITEM7_P108_S3	Interest expense increased in 2013 primarily due to a full year of interest charges related to the $300 million of Series B Senior Notes issued and sold on June 14, 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is not defined by U.S. GAAP.
889900_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense.
889900_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	We present Adjusted EBITDA (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to both the performance of our fundamental business activities and our ability to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
889900_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measures of net income or operating cash flow.
889900_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	The permanent difference for 2012 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and we did not have taxable income in 2012 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	The permanent difference for 2013 includes a deduction of $10.0 million as we fully utilized our remaining net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_15_ITEM7_P111_S3	The permanent difference for 2014 includes a deduction of $8.8 million.
889900_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.
889900_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	We recognized deferred tax expense of approximately $44 million in 2014, $51 million in 2013 and $160 million in 2012.
889900_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_15_ITEM7_P114_S2	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $47.5 million as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P114_S3	The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $7.2 million, net of available foreign tax credits.
889900_15_ITEM7_P114_S4	This liability would be recognized if we received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.
889900_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Please see Risk Factors We are Dependent on the Oil and Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S3	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S4	During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, oil prices averaged $99.96 per barrel, natural gas prices averaged $4.59 per Mcf and demand for drilling activities increased.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S5	During the three months ended December 31, 2014, drilling activity slowed as oil prices averaged $73.16 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $3.80 per Mcf.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S6	Drilling activity has significantly decreased since December 31, 2014, as oil prices averaged $47.22 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $2.99 per Mcf during January 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P116_S7	Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and given current oil pricing and existing market trends, we expect our average number of rigs operating to continue to decline through at least the first quarter of 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	Continued low market prices for oil and natural gas will likely result in decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.
889900_15_ITEM7_P117_S3	Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM7_P117_S4	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.
889900_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
889900_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
889900_15_ITEM7_P118_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_15_ITEM7_P118_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.
889900_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.
889900_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM7_P119_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
889900_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
889900_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

889900_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Report and which is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Report.
889900_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_15_ITEM15_P42_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889900_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_15_ITEM15_P58_S4	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_15_ITEM15_P58_S5	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_15_ITEM15_P61_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_15_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.

889900_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_15_ITEM15_P63_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_15_ITEM15_P63_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.

889900_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_15_ITEM15_P69_S4	The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using the treasury stock method.
889900_15_ITEM15_P69_S5	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.

889900_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_15_ITEM15_P71_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_15_ITEM15_P71_S4	If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses.
889900_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 10).
889900_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S5	In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S6	The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S7	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_15_ITEM15_P75_S8	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

889900_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	of long-lived assets within its contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets at the end of each quarter due to revisions in its oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be separated from other long-lived assets.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S3	The Company performs the first step of its impairment assessments by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each long-lived asset or asset group to its respective carrying value.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S4	In 2014, the Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets in the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were recoverable.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S5	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S6	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.
889900_15_ITEM15_P81_S7	The Company recorded impairment charges of $20.9 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to its oil and natural gas properties.
889900_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional vertical wells versus drilling longer horizontal wells using high capacity rigs).
889900_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to its yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_15_ITEM15_P82_S2	The remaining components of these rigs are retired.
889900_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	In 2014, the Company identified 55 mechanical rigs that it determined would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of the Company s mechanical fleet.
889900_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	In 2013, the Company identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	Also, the Company had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, the Company had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	The Company recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	In 2012, the Company identified 36 rigs that it determined would no longer be marketed and recorded a charge of $5.2 million related to the retirement of these rigs.
889900_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	In 2013, due to a shift in customer demand away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, the Company recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a charge of $29.9 million related to 55 mechanical rigs that were not under contract.
889900_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, the Company had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_15_ITEM15_P85_S3	There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2012.
889900_15_ITEM15_P85_S4	The Company also evaluates its fleet of marketable pressure pumping equipment and in 2012 identified approximately 37,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment that would be retired.

889900_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill by operating segment as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and changes for the years then ended are as follows (in thousands):
889900_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.
889900_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually on December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors.
889900_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	If so, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step impairment test.
889900_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	From time to time, the Company may perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing a qualitative assessment.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	The first step is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment of its goodwill as of December 31, 2013.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S4	In completing the first step of the analysis, the Company used a three-year projection of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value determined using the constant growth method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S5	In developing this fair value estimate, the Company applied key assumptions including an assumed discount rate of 11.87% for the contract drilling reporting unit and an assumed discount rate of 12.40% for the pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S6	An assumed long-term growth rate of 3.00% was used for both reporting units.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S7	Based on the results of the first step of the impairment test in 2013, the Company concluded that no impairment was indicated in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S8	In connection with its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, the Company determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S9	In making this determination, the Company considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for its services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S10	The Company also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence its overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S11	Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.
889900_15_ITEM15_P90_S12	The Company s overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of the Company s reporting units over their carrying values from its 2013 quantitative impairment assessment were also considered.
889900_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company has undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade its fleet of equipment and believes that it is well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted primarily from currently low oil and natural gas prices.
889900_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, the Company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in its contract drilling or pressure pumping reporting units in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of a pressure pumping business.
889900_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	As a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded intangible assets related to a non-compete agreement and the customer relationships acquired.
889900_15_ITEM15_P92_S2	These intangible assets were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
889900_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	The non-compete agreement had a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_15_ITEM15_P93_S3	Amortization expense of $350,000 and $467,000 was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, associated with the non-compete agreement.
889900_15_ITEM15_P93_S4	The non-compete agreement expired in 2013.
889900_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	The value of the customer relationships was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model to determine the present value of the projected cash flows associated with the customers in place at the time of the acquisition and taking into account a contributory asset charge.
889900_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	The resulting intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years.
889900_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	Amortization expense of $3.6 million was recorded in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, associated with customer relationships.

889900_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_15_ITEM15_P164_S1	The permanent difference for 2012 does not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income and the Company did not have taxable income in 2012 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_15_ITEM15_P164_S2	The permanent differences for 2013 include a deduction of $10.0 million as the Company fully utilized its remaining net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_15_ITEM15_P164_S3	The permanent difference for 2014 includes a deduction of $8.8 million.
889900_15_ITEM15_P164_S4	The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes therein were as follows (in thousands):
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S3	The Company expects the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 to be realized as a result of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities and the generation of taxable income; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S4	Other deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of various allowance accounts and tax-deferred expenses expected to generate future tax benefits of approximately $38.4 million.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S5	Other deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of the tax effect of receivables from insurance companies and tax-deferred income not yet recognized for tax purposes.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S6	For income tax purposes, the Company has approximately $164 million of state net operating losses that can be carried forward as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM15_P165_S7	The state net operating losses that can be carried forward, if unused, are scheduled to expire as follows: 2016 $6.8 million; 2025 $630,000; 2026 $16.9 million: 2029 $31.9 million; 2030 $25.7 million; 2031 $82.5 million.

889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	On January 1, 2010, the Company converted its Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S1	Because the statutory tax rates in Canada are lower than those in the United States, this transaction triggered a $5.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as a reduction to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S2	As a result of the above conversion, the Company s Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S3	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company has elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intends to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S4	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $47.5 million as of December 31, 2014.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S5	The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $7.2 million, net of available foreign tax credits.
889900_15_ITEM15_P168_S6	This liability would be recognized if the Company received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.
889900_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	Employee Benefits The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for all eligible employees.

889900_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	We own and operate in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	We were formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Patterson Energy, Inc. and UTI Energy Corp. merged in 2001 to form Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.
889900_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our corporate headquarters are in Houston, Texas.
889900_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.
889900_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 221 marketable land-based drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	A drilling rig is considered marketable at a point in time if it is operating or can be made ready to operate without significant capital expenditures.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components that support our drilling operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S4	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.

889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S11	As a result of the prolonged decline in oil prices, our industry continues to experience a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_16_ITEM1_P3_S12	We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Low commodity prices are negatively impacting spending by exploration and production companies.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	The impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by published rig counts, which in the United States decreased more than 60% during 2015 and is now almost 70% lower than the peak in 2014.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our rig count has also significantly declined.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we had 80 drilling rigs operating in the United States, which was a decrease of 63% from the recent peak of 214 rigs in October 2014.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our operating rig count has continued to decline in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S5	On average, we operated 78 rigs in the United States during January 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S6	Term contracts provided some support of our operating rig count during 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1_P4_S7	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 59 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter and an average of 46 rigs operating under term contracts during 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our pressure pumping business is continuing to experience the effects of reduced spending by customers and downward pressure on pricing.
889900_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Due to market conditions, as of December 31, 2015, we had stacked approximately 38% of our fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	With the weakness in commodity prices since the beginning of 2016, we have seen a significant decrease in the amount of available work, and the profitability of available work has continued to deteriorate.
889900_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	In response, since the beginning of 2016, we have stacked approximately 140,000 fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	In total, we now have stacked slightly more than half of our fleet of more than 1 million hydraulic fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2015, we continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate generally proportionate with the reduction in our rig count.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2015, we significantly reduced our pressure pumping headcount and obtained lowe r prices on many products and services that we use.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	We also reduced our capital expenditures in 2015, and we expect our capital expenditures for 2016 to primarily consist of maintenance capital, inspections and potential upgrades, as we do not expect to b uild any new rigs or purchase any new fracturing horsepower in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	We expect that our term contract coverage in contract drilling and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs in contract drilling and pressure pumping should position us to weather this downturn.
889900_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, we may experience further significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing and in pressure pumping activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
889900_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	oil and natural gas exploration and production.
889900_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	All of our industry segments had operating profits in 2013.
889900_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2014, our contract drilling services and our pressure pumping services segments had operating profits and our oil and natural gas exploration and production segment had an operating loss.
889900_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2014.
889900_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	All of our industry segments had operating losses in 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had 221 marketable land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our marketable drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from approximately 10,000 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Of these drilling rigs, 202 are electric rigs and 19 are mechanical rigs.
889900_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines (the sole energy source for a mechanical rig) into electricity to power the rig.
889900_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as upgrades or replacement parts for marketable rigs.
889900_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, top drives, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs to ensure that our drilling equipment is competitive.
889900_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	We have spent over $1.8 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.
889900_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we spent approximately $527 million, $772 million and $505 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S5	During 2015, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 17 days.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S6	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_16_ITEM1_P16_S7	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that our drilling contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	However, each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis.
889900_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The customer provides the program for the drilling of the well.
889900_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	All of the wells we drilled in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were under daywork contracts.
889900_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	From time to time more than five years ago, we contracted to drill some wells to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot (on a footage basis) or for a fixed fee (on a turnkey basis).
889900_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We generally assume greater operational and economic risk drilling on a turnkey basis than on a footage basis and greater operational and economic risk drilling on a footage basis than on a daywork basis.
889900_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	While conventional wells remain a source of oil and natural gas, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	To address our cust omers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performanc e and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	APEX 1500 rigs are 1,500 horsepower electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other highly automated pipe handling equip ment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	APEX 1000 rigs are 1,000 horsepower electric rigs with advanced technology equipment similar to the APEX 1500 rigs, but with a more compact design to fit on smaller locations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	APEX WALKING rigs are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells fr om a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_16_ITEM1_P25_S3	Many APEX 1500 and APEX 1000 rigs have also been equipped with walking systems as noted below.
889900_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	As of December 31, 2015, our drilli ng fleet was comprised of the following:
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We perform repair and/or overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (Southwest Region) and the Appalachian region (Northeast Region).
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_16_ITEM1_P27_S5	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that our pressure pumping contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P29_S4	However, each pressure pumping contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements or other factors.
889900_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrogen fracturing se rvices as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, wi th a total of approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower as of December 31, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2015 included:
889900_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that do not cover all of our required supply and that sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_16_ITEM1_P31_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Interests We own and invest in oil and natural gas assets as a non-operating working interest owner.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our oil and natural gas working interests are located primarily in producing regions of Texas and New Mexico.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our oil and natural gas assets constituted less than 1% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	Customers Our customer base includes major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2015, we received approximately 49% from our ten largest customers and approximately 33% from our five largest customers.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	During 2015, one customer accounted for approximately $244 million, or approximately 13%, of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_16_ITEM1_P32_S6	These revenues were earned in both our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	The contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand, particularly in an industry downturn, such as the current market environment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_16_ITEM1_P34_S4	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the places in which we operate have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	Any limitation, suspension or moratorium of the services we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_16_ITEM1_P37_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	If such changes are made to CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, each as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	liability for drainage into such waters.
889900_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities.
889900_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	liability for owners and operators is the same under the Fe deral Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages .
889900_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees.
889900_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens.
889900_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
889900_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	In Canada, a variety of federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_16_ITEM1_P49_S7	For more information, please refer to our discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S9	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S11	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S12	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_16_ITEM1_P50_S13	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are no t fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our drilling rigs , pressu re pumping equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be ade quate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our drilling rigs an d pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage , a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S6	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and bu siness interruption, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S7	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S8	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S9	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S10	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S11	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S12	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S13	If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S14	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S15	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S16	We had approximately 3,400 full-time employees as of February 4, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S17	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S18	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_16_ITEM1_P51_S19	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.
889900_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual spring thaw.
889900_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Additionally, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers capital expenditure budgets are depleted.
889900_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
889900_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Oil prices have significantly declined since the second half of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The closing price of oil, which was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, reached a low price for 2015 of $34.55 in December 2015 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.68 in January 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	As a result of the prolonged decline in oil prices, our industry continues to experience a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Currently, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a significant portion of our fracturing horsepower is stacked.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Excess Equipment and a Highly Competitive Oil Service Industry May Adversely Affect our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The North American land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A low commodity price environment, such as the current environment, can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Low commodity prices and construction of new equipment can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to an excess of equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	High competition and excess equipment can cause drilling and pressure pumping contractors to have difficulty maintaining utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	The excess of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and excess pressure pumping equipment, which has been exacerbated by the decline in oil and natural gas prices could affect the fair market value or our drilling and pressure pumping equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets and goodwill.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S10	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S12	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.

889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S17	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S18	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S19	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S20	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S21	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S22	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.

889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S26	We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S27	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S28	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S29	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.

889900_16_ITEM1A_P10_S31	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materiall y adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations .
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	As of December 31, 2015, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $710 million.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Our contract drilling backlog may continue to decline as fixed-term, drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S11	New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in our Industry.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S12	The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of drilling rigs and equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S15	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P11_S16	Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment designed to enhance functionality and performance.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling and pressure pumping technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors equipment and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If any technology that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, we may be adversely affected.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Shortages, Delays in Delivery and Interruptions in Supply of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs .
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations .
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Loss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2015, we received approximately 49% from our ten largest customers, 33% from our five largest customers and 13% from our largest customer.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, when commodity prices improve, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAPS ) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, gas wells are now required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	In December 2014, the EPA finalized amendments to these rules that distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Then in July 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel).
889900_16_ITEM1A_P23_S8	These rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In September 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule that would update and expand the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The EPA also published a proposed rule in September 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	For example, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S7	We have responded to the inquiry.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S8	The EPA released a progress report in December 2012 outlining work currently underway and released a draft assessment report in June 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S9	The draft assessment report concluded that activities have not led to widespread systematic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, but there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing could affect drinking water resources.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Further, we conduct drilling and pressure pumping activities in numerous states.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Regulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain diesel fuel under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Further, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on Indian land.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The rule requires companies to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the BLM.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, in September 201 5, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming granted a preliminary injunction temporarily preventing enforcement of the rule.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In April 2015, the EPA published proposed pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from s hale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performe d and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in res ponse to such regulation.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Finally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In June 2015, New York banned high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Voters in the city of Denton, Texas approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in November 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( PSD ) and Title V programs.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	This final rule tailors the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	However, in June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court in UARG v. EPA limited application of this rule to sources that would otherwise need permits based on emission of conventional pollutants.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In April 2015, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the rule in accordance with the Supreme Court s decision.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Paris Agreement will be open for signing in April 2016 and will require countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years, beginning in 2020.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Legal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on our Business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S8	In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S9	Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P35_S10	Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Political, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Cond ucting International Operations Could Adversely Affect our Opportunities and Future Bus iness.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P36_S6	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	receive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Some of the parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S7	The occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We Are Dependent U pon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long- Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes, term loan agreement, term loan facility and, from time to time, revolving credit facility.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	At December 31, 2015, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $70.0 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.875%.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S6	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $632,000.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S7	We have in place a term loan agreement which bears interest, at our election, at the per annum rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% or base rate plus 2.25%.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S8	As of December 31, 2015, we had $185 million outstanding under the term loan agreement at an interest rate of 3.875%.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P41_S9	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the term loan agreement as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.8 million.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As of December 31, 2015, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_16_ITEM1A_P43_S7	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is in leased office space and is located at 450 Gears Road, Suite 500, Houston, Texas.
889900_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that address is (281) 765-7100.
889900_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our primary administrative office, which is located in Snyder, Texas, is owned and includes approximately 37,000 square feet of office and storage space.
889900_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our drilling services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Pressure Pumping Our pre ssure pumping services are supported by several offices and yard facilities located throughout our areas of operations, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
889900_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	Oil and Natural Gas Working Interests Our interests in oil and natural gas properties are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	We own our administrative offices in Snyder, Texas, as well as several of our other facilities.
889900_16_ITEM2_P2_S2	We also lease a number of facilities, and we do not believe that any one of the leased facilities is individually material to our operations.
889900_16_ITEM2_P2_S3	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our needs.
889900_16_ITEM2_P2_S4	We incorporate by reference in response to this item the information set forth in Item 1 of this Report and the information set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
889900_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and is quoted under the symbol PTEN.
889900_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Our common stock is included in the S P MidCap 400 Index and several other market indices.
889900_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table provides high and low sales prices of our common stock for the periods indicated:
889900_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	(b) Holders As of February 4, 2016, there were approximately 1,300 holders of record of our common stock.
889900_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	(c) Dividends We paid cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 as follows:
889900_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	On February 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 24, 2016 to holders of record as of March 10, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	Our 2015 Term Loan Agreement contains a covenant that could restrict our ability to make dividend payments later in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM5_P3_S2	This covenant applies to only the 2015 Term Loan Agreement indebtedness, and we believe that our strong financial position allows us various alternatives to address this restriction, including repayment of this debt.

889900_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Recent Developments Oil prices have significantly declined since the second half of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The closing price of oil, which was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, reached a low price for 2015 of $34.55 in December 2015 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.68 in January 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Low commodity prices are negatively impacting spending by exploration and production companies.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	The impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by published rig counts, which in the United States decreased more than 60% during 2015 and is now almost 70% lower than the peak in 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our rig count has also significantly declined.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we had 80 drilling rigs operating in the United States, which was a decrease of 63% from the recent peak of 214 rigs in October 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our operating rig count has continued to decline in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	On average, we operated 78 rigs in the United States during January 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	Term contracts provided some support of our operating rig count during 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 59 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter and an average of 46 rigs operating under term contracts during 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our pressure pumping business is continuing to experience the effects of reduced spending by customers and downward pressure on pricing.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Due to market conditions, as of December 31, 2015, we had stacked approximately 38% of our fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	With the weakness in commodity prices since the beginning of 2016, we have seen a significant decrease in the amount of available work, and the profitability of available work has continued to deteriorate.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	In response, since the beginning of 2016, we have stacked approximately 140,000 fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	In total, we now have stacked slightly more than half of our fleet of more than 1 million hydraulic fracturing horsepower.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	In anticipation of this downturn, we began reducing our cost structure in the fourth quarter of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S6	In 2015, we continued to reduce our cost structure and, to date, we have reduced our drilling headcount at a rate generally proportionate with the reduction in our rig count.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S7	In 2015, we significantly reduced our pressure pumping headcount and obtained lower prices on many products and services that we use.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S8	We also reduced our capital expenditures in 2015, and we expect our capital expenditures for 2016 to primarily consist of maintenance capital, inspections and potential upgrades, as we do not expect to build any new rigs or purchase any new fracturing horsepower in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S9	We plan to continue to adjust our cost structure in line with our level of operating activity.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S10	We expect that our term contract coverage in contract drilling and scalability with respect to labor and other operating costs in contract drilling and pressure pumping should position us to weather this downturn.
889900_16_ITEM7_P3_S11	In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, we may experience further significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing and in pressure pumping activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a leading provider of services to the North American oil and natural gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our services primarily involve the drilling, on a contract basis, of land-based oil and natural gas wells and pressure pumping services.
889900_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition to these services, we also invest, on a non-operating working interest basis, in oil and natural gas properties.
889900_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	We operate land-based drilling rigs in oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, and oil and natural gas prices are significantly depressed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2015, our average number of rigs operating in the United States was 88 compared to an average of 210 drilling rigs operating during the same period in 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2015, our average number of rigs operating in Canada was three compared to an average of nine drilling rigs operating during the fourth quarter of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2015, our rig fleet included 161 APEX rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	We do not expect to add any new rigs to our fleet during 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	In connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_16_ITEM7_P5_S8	We have increased the horsepower of our pressure pumping fleet by more than eight-fold since the beginning of 2009, although we have not ordered or committed to purchase any new horsepower since October 2014 and there is currently no new horsepower on order.
889900_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $710 million and $1.5 billion, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The decrease in backlog at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the revenue earned since December 31, 2014, including from the receipt of early termination payments, and the expiration and termination of term contracts.
889900_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Approximately 40 percent of the total December 31, 2015 backlog is reasonably expected to remain after 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the ri g is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, generally our term drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termina tion payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate , for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized , as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment .
889900_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	For the three years ended December 31, 2015, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, the profitability of our business is impacted most by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	During 2015, our average number of rigs operating was 120 in the United States and four in Canada compared to 203 in the United States and eight in Canada in 2014 and 184 in the United States and eight in Canada in 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our average rig revenue per operating day was $25,560 in 2015 compared to $23,880 in 2014 and $24,020 in 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	We had a consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015 compared to consolidated net income of $163 million for 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	The financial results for 2015 include pretax non-cash charges totaling approximately $288 million.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	These charges include $125 million from the impairment of all goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business, $131 million from the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components, $22.0 from the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities and $10.7 million related to the impairment of certain oil and natural gas properties.
889900_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	The financial results for 2014 include a pretax non-cash charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components.
889900_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Oil and natural gas prices and our monthly average number of rigs operating have significantly declined from recent highs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	In December 2015, our average number of rigs operating was 82 in the United States.
889900_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	In January 2016, our average number of rigs operating decreased to 78 in the United States.
889900_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives.
889900_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Based on management s expectations of future trends, we estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured at fai r value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs).
889900_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The remaining components of these rigs will be retired.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and 9 non-APEX electric rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Although these 15 rigs remain marketable, we have lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remain marketable but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed, and we recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the reduced size of our mechanical fleet.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S6	Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S7	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S8	In 2013, we recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S9	We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.
889900_16_ITEM7_P20_S10	There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel in March 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Although the price improvement was earlier than we projected, this improvement was generally consistent with our assumption at December 31, 2014 that oil prices would improve late in 2015 and continue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, we received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	We believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	With lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S7	In light of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S8	We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S9	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S10	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S11	Due to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S12	We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S13	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S14	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S15	For both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM7_P22_S16	Rigs not under term contracts will be subject to pricing in the spot market.
889900_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns.
889900_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	While we believe these assumptions with respect to future pricing for oil and natural gas are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The timeframe over which oil and natural gas prices will recover is highly uncertain.
889900_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Potential events that could affect our assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as:
889900_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	If the current lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment were to last into 2017 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if it is, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test.
889900_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	From time to time, we may perform the first step of the quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The first step of the quantitative testing is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel in March 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Although the price improvement was earlier than we projected, this improvement was generally consistent with our assumption at December 31, 2014, that oil prices would improve in late 2015 and continue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, we received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	We believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S5	During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 24, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S6	With lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S7	In light of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S8	In completing the first step of the assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S9	The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S10	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S11	Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S12	In the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill of the pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S13	We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of the goodwill of our contract drilling reporting unit as of December 31, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S14	In completing the first step of the assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S15	The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S16	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_16_ITEM7_P29_S17	Based on the results of the first step of the quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for our services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	Our overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the f air values of our reporting units over their carrying values from our 2013 quantitative Step 1 assessment of goodwill were also considered.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells.
889900_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	All of the wells we drilled in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Key estimates used by management include:
889900_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	approximately $ 10.7 million, $ 20.9 million and $ 4.0 million for the years ended Dece mber 31, 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively, and is included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity as of December 31, 2015 included approximately $178 million in working capital and $500 million available under our revolving credit facility.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	We believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	If under current market conditions we desire to pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would likely require additional debt or equity financing.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $178 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $113 million, compared to working capital of $341 million and cash and cash equivalents of $43 million at December 31, 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	During 2015, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	$20.8 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	During 2015, we used a net of $303 million to pay off our revolving credit facility, $58.8 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $27.5 million to repay long-term debt, $8.0 million to acquire shares of our common stock, $2.0 million to pay debt issuance costs and $744 million:
889900_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.
889900_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:
889900_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	On February 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.10 per share to be paid on March 24, 2016 to holders of record as of March 10, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our 2015 Term Loan Agreement contains a covenant that could restrict our ability to make dividend payments later in 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	This covenant applies to only the 2015 Term Loan Agreement indebtedness, and we believe that our strong financial position allows us various alternatives to address this restriction, including repayment of this debt.
889900_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, the amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.
889900_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	On July 25, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program authorizing purchases of up to $150 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors terminated any remaining authority under the 2012 stock buyback program, and approved a new stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2013 stock buyback program.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Shares purchased under a buyback program are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	We acquired shares of stock from employees during 2015, 2014 and 2013 that are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	These shares were acquired at fair market value.
889900_16_ITEM7_P50_S6	These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan ) or the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan ) and not pursuant to the stock buyback programs.

889900_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.
889900_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decline in prices for oil and natural gas, together with the reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years have resulted in an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	Also in recent years, customer demand has shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2015 and 2014 follows:
889900_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 includes a $12.3 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S4	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2014 includes a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical drilling rigs and the write-off of excess spare mechanical rig components.
889900_16_ITEM7_P91_S5	The increase in depreciation expense also reflects significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.

889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of jobs, although the average size of the fracturing jobs increased.
889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Average revenue per fracturing job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of the increased size of the jobs in 2015 as compared to 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities.
889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	There were no similar charges in 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P93_S5	Depreciation expense also increased due to capital expenditures and acquisitions.
889900_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	All of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depletion and impairment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Oil and natural gas and liquids revenues decreased as a result of lower commodity prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Direct operating costs include a reduction in taxes due to lower revenues.
889900_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	Depletion and impairment expense in 2015 includes approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments compared to approximately $20.9 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Interest expense increased primarily due to borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement.
889900_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:
889900_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.
889900_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	The deman d for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	Customer demand shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the f iscal quarters and full year in 201 4 and 201 3 follows:
889900_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of an increase in the number of rigs operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Revenues in 2013 included approximately $65.2 million of early termination revenues.
889900_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2013 due to the early termination revenue.
889900_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	Capital expenditures were incurred in 2014 and 2013 to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional equipment including top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	We recorded additional depreciation, amortization and impairment expense of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the now reduced size of our mechanical fleet.
889900_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	In 2013, we identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Also, we had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	We recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM7_P107_S4	Significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to add new rig capacity also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense.
889900_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.
889900_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in the size of our jobs and the size of our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	In connection with the horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs, includ ing the June 2014 acquisition of an East Texas-based pressure pumping operation and the October 2014 acquisition of a Texas-based pressure pumping operation.
889900_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	As a result, we continued to experience an increase in the number of these larger multi-stage fra cturing jobs as a proportion of the total fracturing jobs we performed.
889900_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	Additionally, the average size of the multi-stage fracturing jobs increased.
889900_16_ITEM7_P110_S3	Average revenue per fracturing job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of this increase in the proportion of larger multi-stage fracturing jobs and the increased size of the jobs in 2014 as compared to 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P110_S4	Depreciation expense increased due to capital expenditures.
889900_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depletion and impairment.
889900_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Oil revenues decreased as a result of lower average oil prices and lower production.
889900_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	Natural gas and liquids revenue increased due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower production.
889900_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	Direct operating costs and depletion expense increased primarily due to the addition of new wells.
889900_16_ITEM7_P112_S3	Depletion and impairment expense in 2014 includes approximately $20.9 million of oil and natural gas property impairments, compared to approximately $4.0 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P112_S4	The impairment in 2014 is primarily the result of lower oil prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense for 2014 increased primarily due to higher personnel costs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The net gain on the disposal of assets in 2014 resulted primarily from miscellaneous sales of drilling equipment and sales of certain oil and natural gas properties.
889900_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is not defined by U.S. GAAP.
889900_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense.
889900_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	We present Adjusted EBITDA (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to both the performance of our fundamental business activities and our ability to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
889900_16_ITEM7_P115_S3	Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measures of net income (loss) or operating cash flow.
889900_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Domestic Production Activities Deduction (IRC section 199 deduction) was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (as revised by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) and allows a deduction of 9% in 2010 and thereafter on the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	The permanent differences for 2013 include a deduction of $10.0 million as we fully utilized our remaining net operating loss carryforwards.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	The permanent differences for 2014 include a deduction of $8.8 million.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	The permanent differences for 2015 do not include any deduction as it is limited to taxable income, and we did not have taxable income in 2015 as a result of our election to utilize bonus depreciation.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	The 2015 other differences include a 1.0% reduction related to the reconciliation of the deferred tax liability associated with the conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S5	The impact to the deferred tax liability from the conversion is being amortized over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_16_ITEM7_P117_S6	The 2015 other differences also include a 0.7% reduction for the lost benefit of the 2014 IRC section 199 deduction of $8.8 million as a result of our adoption of the final tangible property regulations with the filing of the 2014 tax return.
889900_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.
889900_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_16_ITEM7_P118_S3	We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $100 million in 2015 and deferred tax expense of approximately $44 million in 2014 and $51 million in 2013.
889900_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	increase to deferred i ncome tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	This will be fully amortized by December 31, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $28.4 million as of December 31, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P121_S3	The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $3.8 million, net of available foreign tax credits.
889900_16_ITEM7_P121_S4	This liability would be recognized if we received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.
889900_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	Please see Risk Factors We are Dependent on the Oil and Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S4	Oil prices have significantly declined since the second half of 2014.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S5	The closing price of oil, which was as high as $105.68 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, reached a low price for 2015 of $34.55 in December 2015 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.68 in January 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S6	As a result of the prolonged decline in oil prices, our industry continues to experience a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S7	We do not expect this to change until commodity prices improve.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S8	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S9	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S10	A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S11	Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P123_S12	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.
889900_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
889900_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
889900_16_ITEM7_P124_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P124_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

889900_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.
889900_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of debt issuance costs.
889900_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	Under this guidance, debt issuance costs shall be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt and shall not be classified as a deferred charge.
889900_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	Amortization of debt issuance costs shall continue to be reported as interest expense.
889900_16_ITEM7_P126_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM7_P126_S4	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets.
889900_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	Under this guidance, for a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount.
889900_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7_P127_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Under the Credit Agreement, interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2015, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans is 2.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.25% as of January 1, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2015, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $70.0 million outstanding under our term loan facility at an interest rate of 2.875%.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement is variable and adjusts at each interest payment date based on our election of LIBOR or the base rate.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term credit facility as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $632,000.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	Loans under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement bear interest, at our election, at the per annum rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% or base rate plus 2.25%.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S9	As of December 31, 2015, we had $185 million principal amount outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement at an interest rate of 3.875%.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P0_S10	A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under 2015 Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2015 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.8 million.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We are obligated to pay to the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.

889900_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
889900_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

889900_16_ITEM15_P42_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
889900_16_ITEM15_P42_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
889900_16_ITEM15_P42_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
889900_16_ITEM15_P42_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
889900_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
889900_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P43_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A description of the business and basis of presentation follows: Description of business Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as Patterson-UTI or the Company ), provides onshore contract drilling services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators in the continental United States and western Canada.
889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company provides pressure pumping services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region.
889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company also invests in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.
889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S3	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Patterson-UTI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S4	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
889900_16_ITEM15_P49_S5	Except for wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has no controlling financial interests in any other entity which would require consolidation.
889900_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company s operations except for its Canadian operations, which use the Canadian dollar as its functional currency.
889900_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The effects of exchange rate changes are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders equity.
889900_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	A summary of the significant accounting policies follows: Management estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	All of the wells the Company drilled in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount.
889900_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses existing in the Company s accounts receivable.
889900_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at least quarterly.
889900_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability.
889900_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Account balances, when determined to be uncollectable, are charged against the allowance.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Inventories Inventories consist primarily of sand and other products to be used in conjunction with the Company s pressure pumping activities.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined under the average cost method.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	Property and equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S3	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S4	The method of depreciation does not change whenever equipment becomes idle.
889900_16_ITEM15_P58_S5	The estimated useful lives, in years, are shown below:
889900_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful life.
889900_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Company reviews wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	drilling, the Company considers the well costs to be impaired and recognizes the costs as expense.
889900_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	Geologi cal and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on management s expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.
889900_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company reviews unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company s impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as management s intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company assesses impairment of its goodwill at least annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may have decreased below its carrying value.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Maintenance and repairs Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing property and equipment are capitalized.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	Disposals Upon disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	Net income (loss) per common share The Company provides a dual presentation of its net income (loss) per common share in its consolidated statements of operations: Basic net income (loss) per common share ( Basic EPS ) and diluted net income (loss) per common share ( Diluted EPS ).
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S4	Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by first allocating earnings between common stockholders and holders of non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S5	Basic EPS is then determined by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S6	Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares, including stock options, non-vested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S7	The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using the treasury stock method.
889900_16_ITEM15_P68_S8	The dilutive effect of non-vested shares of restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method, assuming a reallocation of undistributed earnings to common stockholders after considering the dilutive effect of potential common shares other than non-vested shares of restricted stock.
889900_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average numbe r of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands, except per share amounts):
889900_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income taxes The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.
889900_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
889900_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
889900_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
889900_16_ITEM15_P70_S4	If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
889900_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payments under the fair-value-based method.
889900_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	Under this method, compensation cost related to share-based payments is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.
889900_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	This expense is recognized over the expected life of the awards (See Note 10).
889900_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	Statement of cash flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and money market funds.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S5	In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S6	The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S7	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P74_S8	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of debt issuance costs.
889900_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Under this guidance, debt issua nce costs shall be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt and shall not be classified as a deferred charge.
889900_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	Amortization of debt issuance costs shall continue to be reported as interest expense.
889900_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	T he requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P75_S4	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s con solidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets.
889900_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Under this guidance, for a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount.
889900_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_16_ITEM15_P76_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Acquisitions During 2014, the Company completed two pressure pumping acquisitions.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	In June 2014, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the East Texas-based pressure pumping assets of a privately held company.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	This acquisition included 31,500 horsepower of hydraulic fracturing equipment.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	In October 2014, a subsidiary of the Company completed the acquisition of the Texas-based pressure pumping assets of a privately held company.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S4	This acquisition included 148,250 horsepower of hydraulic fracturing equipment.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S5	In total, the Company paid $176 million in cash for these two acquisitions plus the assumption of property leases and other contractual obligations.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S6	The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on fair value.
889900_16_ITEM15_P77_S7	A summary of the purchase price allocation follows (in thousands):
889900_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the Company s consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition.
889900_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	Revenues of $80.8 million and income from operations of $13.7 million from the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
889900_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	The following represents pro-forma unaudited financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 as if the acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2013 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
889900_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
889900_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The following table summarizes depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense related to property and equipment and intangible assets for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
889900_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs).
889900_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to the Company s other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to the Company s yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	The remaining components of these rigs will be retired.
889900_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	In 2015, the Company identified 24 mechanical rigs and 9 non-APEX electric rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	Also, the Company had 15 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM15_P82_S2	Although these 15 rigs remain marketable, the Company has lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM15_P82_S3	In 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remain marketable but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.
889900_16_ITEM15_P82_S4	In 2014, the Company identified 55 mechanical rigs that it determined would no longer be marketed, and the Company recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the reduced size of the Company s mechanical fleet.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	In 2013, the Company identified 48 rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	Also, the Company had 55 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	Although these 55 rigs remained marketable at the time, the Company had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to electric powered drilling rigs.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S3	In 2013, the Company recorded a charge of $37.8 million related to the retirement of the 48 rigs and the 55 mechanical rigs that remained marketable but were not operating.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S4	The Company also periodically evaluates its pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.
889900_16_ITEM15_P83_S5	There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.
889900_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable (a triggering event ).
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel in March 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	Although the price improvement was earlier than the Company projected, this improvement was generally consistent with the Company s assumption at December 31, 2014 that oil prices would improve late in 2015 and continue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S3	During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, the Company received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S4	The Company believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S5	During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S6	With lower oil prices in August, the Company lowered its expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P85_S7	In light of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, management deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within its contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and the Company determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S3	Due to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, management deemed it necessary to again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S4	The Company performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within its contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S5	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and the Company determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S6	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S7	For both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively .
889900_16_ITEM15_P86_S8	Rigs not under term contracts will be subject to pricing in the spot market.
889900_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	Company s historical experience in prior downturns.
889900_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in respo nse to improved oil prices.
889900_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	While management believes these assumptions with respect to future pricing for oil and natural gas are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.
889900_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The timeframe over which oil and natural gas prices will recover is highly uncertain.
889900_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	Potential events that could affect the Company s assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as:
889900_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas.
889900_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	All of these factors are beyond the Company s control.
889900_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	If the current lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment were to last into 2017 and beyond, the Company s actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in these assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future and such impairment could be material.
889900_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	With respect to the long-lived assets in the Company s oil and natural gas exploration and production segment, the Company assessed the recoverability of long-lived assets each quarter due to revisions in oil and natural gas reserve estimates and expectations about future commodity prices.
889900_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company s analysis indicated that the carrying amounts of certain oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable at various testing dates in 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P91_S2	The Company s estimates of expected future net cash flows from impaired properties are used in measuring the fair value of such properties.

889900_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	There were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill in the contract drilling operating segment as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.
889900_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	The Company s reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be its operating segments.
889900_16_ITEM15_P94_S3	The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if it is, then goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test.
889900_16_ITEM15_P94_S4	From time to time, the Company may perform the first step of the quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.
889900_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The first step of the quantitative testing is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the shortfall.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, oil prices averaged $48.54 per barrel and reached a low of $43.39 per barrel i n March 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	Oil prices improved during the second quarter of 2015 and averaged $57.85 per barrel.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	Although the price improvement was earlier than the Company projected, this improvement was generally consistent with the Company s assumption at December 31, 2014, that oil prices would improve in late 2015 and co ntinue to improve in 2016, resulting in improved activity levels for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S3	During the second quarter of 2015 as oil prices increased, the Company received requests from customers to reactivate drilling rigs to resume operations in the third quarter of 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S4	The Company believed this was an indication that future activity levels would be improving for both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S5	During the third quarter of 2015, however, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel and reached a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel i n August 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S6	With lower oil prices in August, the Company lowered its expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drill ing and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S7	In light of the Company s revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping servic es during the third quarter of 2015, the Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2015.
889900_16_ITEM15_P96_S8	In completing the first step of the assessment , the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the in come and market valuation methods.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	The inputs included assumptions related to the future perform ance of the Company s contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for the Company s services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	Based on the results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and management concluded that no impairment was indicated in its contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in its pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill of the pressure pumping reporting unit.

889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S5	In completing the first step of the assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S6	The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S7	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of the Company s contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for the Company s services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S8	Based on the results of the first step of the quantitative impairment assessment of its goodwill as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and management concluded that no impairment was indicated in its contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S9	In connection with its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, the Company determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts and further testing was not necessary.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S10	In making this determination, the Company considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for its services in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S11	The Company also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence its overall level of business activity in these operating segments.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S12	Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.
889900_16_ITEM15_P97_S13	The Company s overall market capitalization and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of the Company s reporting units over their carrying values from its 2013 quantitative impairment assessment were also considered.
889900_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company has undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade its fleet of equipment and believes that it is well positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells that has resulted primarily from currently low oil and natural gas prices.
889900_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, the Company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in its contract drilling reporting unit in the future, and such impairment could be material.
889900_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded in the pressure pumping operating segment in connection with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of the assets of a pressure pumping business.

889900_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	These intangible assets were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.
889900_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	The non-compete agreement had a term of three years from October 1, 2010.
889900_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	The value of this agreement was estimated using a with and without scenario where cash flows were projected through the term of the agreement assuming the agreement is in place and compared to cash flows assuming the non-compete agreement was not in place.
889900_16_ITEM15_P100_S2	The intangible asset associated with the non-compete agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term of the agreement.
889900_16_ITEM15_P100_S3	Amortization expense of $350,000 was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 associated with the non-compete agreement.

889900_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	We were formed in 1978 and reincorporated in 1993 as a Delaware corporation.
889900_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.
889900_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2016, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 202 marketed land-based drilling rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components that support our drilling operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower (approximately 1.0 million of which was hydraulic fracturing horsepower) to provide these services.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment, including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	We also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	Recent Developments Quarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are as follows:
889900_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $10 7.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	Oil and natural gas prices have recovered substantially from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and certain non-OPEC countries, including Russia, a nnounced an agreement to cut oil production.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	The announcement resulted in an increase in oil prices, which averaged $51.97 per barrel in December 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have been increasing, and we believe they will conti nue to increase throughout 2017 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has steadily improved on a monthly basis since May 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	For the fourth quarter, our average rig count improved to 66 rigs in the United States, up from the third quarter average of 60 rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2016 of 74 rigs was 42% greater than the low of 52 rigs in April 2016; however, it was 65% less than the high of 214 rigs in October 2014.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S6	Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.
889900_17_ITEM1_P4_S7	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 44 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2017 and an average of 37 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2017.
889900_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Activity levels in our pressure pumping business have also improved.
889900_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Looking forward, we expect to see further increases in activity across the industry, especially in the Permian Basin.
889900_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have reactivated two frac spreads since mid-December 2016 at a cost of approximately $2 million per spread, including both operating and capital expenditures.
889900_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Approximately 45% of the more than one million hydraulic fracturing horsepower in our fleet remains stacked.
889900_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	We expect the cost to reactivate our remaining idle frac spreads would be approximately $3 million per frac spread, including both operating and capital expenditures.
889900_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	On December 12, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the merger agreement ) with Seventy Seven Energy Inc. ( SSE ), pursuant to which a subsidiary of ours will be merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (the SSE merger ).
889900_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Under the merger agreement, we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SSE in exchange for approximately 49.6 million shares of our common stock, subject to certain downward adjustments set forth in the merger agreement.
889900_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	SSE provides contract drilling, pressure pumping and oilfield rental services in many of the most active oil and natural gas plays onshore in the United States.
889900_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	SSE owns a fleet of 40 AC drilling rigs, approximately 93% of which are pad capable, including 28 fit-for-purpose PeakeRigs .
889900_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	The remainder of SSE s rig fleet includes 51 SCR rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	Additionally, SSE owns approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in the Anadarko Basin and Eagle Ford Shale.
889900_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The SSE oilfield rentals business has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.
889900_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	The completion of the SSE merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, approval by our and SSE s respective stockholders and other closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
889900_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Subject to closing conditions, the SSE merger is expected to be completed late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2017.
889900_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to two industry segments:
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Both of these industry segments had operating losses in 2016 and 2015.
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	In 2014, both of these industry segments had operating profits.
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	We changed our reporting segment presentation in 2016, as we no longer consider our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities to be significant to an understanding of our results.
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	We now present the oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, drilling technology and international activities as Other and Corporate reflects only corporate activities.
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	This change in segment presentation was applied retrospectively to all periods presented herein.
889900_17_ITEM1_P13_S5	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had 202 marketed land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our marketed drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from approximately 13,000 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	All of these drilling rigs are electric rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	An electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines into electricity to power the rig.
889900_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as upgrades or replacement parts for marketed rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, top drives, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	We have spent approximately $1.4 billion during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.
889900_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $73 million, $527 million and $772 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Depth and complexity of the well, drill site conditions and the number of wells to be drilled on a pad are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to three years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S5	During 2016, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 14 days.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S6	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_17_ITEM1_P20_S7	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that our drilling contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, each drilling contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements, applicable law or other factors.
889900_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis.
889900_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The customer provides the program for the drilling of the well.
889900_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	All of the wells we drilled in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were under daywork contracts.
889900_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	From time to time more than five years ago, we contracted to drill some wells to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot (on a footage basis) or for a fixed fee (on a turnkey basis).
889900_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We generally assume greater operational and economic risk drilling on a turnkey basis than on a footage basis and greater operational and economic risk drilling on a footage basis than on a daywork basis.
889900_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	While conventional wells remain a source of oil and natural gas, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	To address our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	APEX rigs are electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other automated pipe handling equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	APEX rigs that are pad capable are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2016, our marketed land-based drilling fleet was comprised of the following:
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The U.S. land rig industry has recently begun referring to certain high specification rigs as super-spec rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	We consider a super-spec rig to be a 1,500 horsepower, AC powered rig that has a 750,000 pound hookload, has a 7,500 psi circulating system and is pad capable.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	We currently estimate there are approximately 375 super-spec rigs in the United States, which includes 65 of our APEX rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	We perform repair and/or overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S4	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (Southwest Region) and the Appalachian region (Northeast Region).
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S5	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S6	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S7	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_17_ITEM1_P30_S8	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	We believe that our pressure pumping contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P32_S4	However, each pressure pumping contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements, applicable law or other factors.
889900_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic and nitrog en fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, wi th a total of approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower (approximately 1.0 million of which was hydraulic fracturing horsepower) as of December 31, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2016 included:
889900_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that do not cover all of our required supply and sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_17_ITEM1_P34_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material, or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials.
889900_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Customers Our customer base includes major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2016, we received approximately 51% from our ten largest customers and approximately 33% from our five largest customers.
889900_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	During 2016, one customer accounted for approximately $124 million, or approximately 14%, of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	These revenues were earned in both our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive.
889900_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand, particularly in an industry downturn, such as the current market environment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	We expect that the market for land drilling and pressure pumping services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the places in which we operate have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business .
889900_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future .
889900_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material , and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance .
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	Any limitation, suspension or moratorium of the services we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_17_ITEM1_P40_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	For example, in December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA.
889900_17_ITEM1_P43_S3	The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking by March 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.
889900_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	If changes are made to the classification of exploration and production wastes under CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, each as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	liability for drainage into such waters.
889900_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities.
889900_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Oil Poll ution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial h arm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters .
889900_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions .
889900_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages .
889900_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees.
889900_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens.
889900_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
889900_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	In Canada, a variety of federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S5	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S6	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_17_ITEM1_P53_S7	For more information, please refer to our discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S5	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_17_ITEM1_P54_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to neg ligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S6	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S7	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S8	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S9	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S10	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S11	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S12	We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cyber risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S13	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S14	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S15	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S16	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S17	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S18	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S19	If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S20	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S21	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S22	We had approximately 3,600 full-time employees as of February 7, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S23	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S24	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_17_ITEM1_P55_S25	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.
889900_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual spring thaw.
889900_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additionally, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers capital expenditure budgets are depleted.
889900_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
889900_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Oil prices averaged $49.15 during the fourth quarter of 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	As a result of the lower level of oil prices, our industry has experienced a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Currently, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a significant portion of our fracturing horsepower is stacked.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of further decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The North American land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	A low commodity price environment can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Low commodity prices and construction of new equipment can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to an excess supply of equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, we may be unable to replace fixed-term contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Accordingly, high competition and excess equipment can cause drilling and pressure pumping contractors to have difficulty maintaining utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	The excess supply of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and excess pressure pumping equipment, which has been exacerbated by the decline in oil and natural gas prices could affect the fair market value or our drilling and pressure pumping equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets and goodwill.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S11	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S13	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S14	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S15	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S16	In general, our customer contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as oilfield anti-indemnity acts expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party s indemnification of us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not availab le or because of the high premium costs .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our drilling rigs , pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, autom obile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will cont inue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such drilling rigs , pressure pumping equipment or other assets .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, we gen erally maintain a $1. 5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage , a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability covera ge, and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cyber risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S13	If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S15	Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S16	However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S17	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S18	In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S19	As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S20	In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S21	As of December 31, 2016, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $417 million.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S22	Our contract drilling backlog may continue to decline as fixed-term drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S23	New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in Our Industry.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S24	The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of drilling rigs and equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S25	Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S26	Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S27	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P11_S28	Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment designed to enhance functionality and performance.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling and pressure pumping technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors equipment and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If any technolog y that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, w e may be adversely affected .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, n ew technologies, services or standards could render so me of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Shortages, Delays in Delivery, and Interruptions in Supply, of Equipment and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	During periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of equipment for upgrades, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to operate, maintain, upgrade and construct our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Loss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly after a prolonged industry downturn.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In addition, even if it is generally a period of lower demand for our services, if there is a high demand for our services in certain areas, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform services in such areas.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S11	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2016, we received approximately 51% from our ten largest customers, 33% from our five largest customers and 14% from our largest customer.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Growth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While we have entered into the merger agreement with SSE, there is no assurance that the SSE merger will be completed.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The SSE merger is subject to a number of conditions, certain of which are beyond our control and may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, improved commodity prices may cause contract drillers to continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services to continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	See -Risk Factors Relating to the Pending SSE Merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and a manufacturer and servicer of oilfield service equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAPS ) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates and expands the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, the EPA has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The EPA also published a final rule in June 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In November 2016, the Department of the Interior issued final rules relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The rules limit routine flaring of natural gas, require the payment of royalties on avoidable gas losses and require plans or programs relating to gas capture and leak detection and repair.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These or other initiatives could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fract uring or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, the EPA conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The EPA released its final report in December 2016.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Further, we conduct drilling and pressure pumping activities in numerous states.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In addition, legislation has been proposed, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	These bills, if enacted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Regulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain diesel fuel under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on Indian land.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The rule requires companies to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the BLM.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	However, in June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down the rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	That decision is currently being appealed by the federal government.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, in light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ( OCC ) has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK plays that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Finally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P30_S7	In June 2015, New York banned high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Voters in the city of Denton, Texas approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in November 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Design, Manufacture, Sal e and Servicing of Products, including Rig Components, May Subject Us to Liability for Personal Injury, Property Damage and Environmental Contamination Should Such Equipment Fail to Perform to Specifications.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We provide products, including rig components such as top drives, to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Because of applications which use our products and services, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, leading to claims against us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( PSD ) and Title V programs.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	This final rule tailors the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	However, in June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court in UARG v. EPA limited application of this rule to sources that would otherwise need permits based on emission of conventional pollutants.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In April 2015, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the rule in accordance with the Supreme Court s decision.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S6	These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S7	The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Also, in November 2016, the EPA published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Legal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S7	The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S8	In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S10	Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S11	Political, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Opportunities and Future Business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S12	We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P38_S13	Also, through our recent Warrior acquisition, we sell products, including rig components, for use in numerous oil and gas producing regions outside of North America.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated wit h foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements, or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	receive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Some parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted or where our consumers for the Warrior products are located have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	The occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under our Long-Term Debt We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Servic e Obligations to Increase Significantly .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75% as of January 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S7	As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S8	We have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S9	We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P45_S10	As of December 31, 2016, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P46_S7	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Risk Factors Related to the Pending SSE Merger Our expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending SSE merger:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The SSE Merger is Subject to Conditions, Including Certain Conditions That May Not Be Satisfied, or Completed on a Timely Basis, If At All.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The SSE merger is subject to a number of conditions, certain of which are beyond our control and may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Notably, the completion of the SSE merger is conditioned on receiving the approval of both our and SSE s respective stockholders.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	At any time prior to the receipt of such approvals, each of our board of directors and the board of directors of SSE may change its recommendation with respect to the SSE merger, in each case in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, among other things, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and complies with certain other specified conditions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Consequently, we cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Any delay in completing the SSE merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the SSE merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Current Patterson-UTI Stockholders Will Have a Reduced Ownership and Voting Interest in the Combined Company After the SSE Merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S6	We will issue up to 49,559,000 shares of common stock to SSE stockholders in the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P49_S7	As a result of these issuances, SSE stockholders are expected to hold up to approximately 23% of the combined company s outstanding common stock immediately following completion of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our stockholders currently have the right to vote for our directors and on other matters affecting our company.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Each of our stockholders will remain a stockholder of our company w ith a percentage ownership of the combined company that will be smaller than the stockholder s percentage of our company prior to the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, our stockholders will have less voting power in the combin ed company than they now have with respect to our company .
889900_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Uncertainties Associated With the SSE Merger May Cause a Loss of Key Employees, Which Could Adversely Affect the Future Business and Operations of the Combined Company.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plan.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our success until the SSE merger and the combined company s success after the SSE merger will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the SSE merger, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key personnel.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract or retain our own employees.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Failure to Complete the SSE Merger Could Negatively Impact Our Future Business and Financial Results.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the conditions to the SSE merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P52_S6	If the SSE merger is not completed, our financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to:
889900_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	the potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, if the SSE merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If the SSE merger is not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The Merger Agreement Contains Provisions That Limit Our Ability to Pursue Alternatives to the SSE Merger, Could Discourage a Potential Competing Acquirer of Us From Making a Favorable Alternative Transaction Proposal and, in Specified Circumstances, Could Require Us to Pay a Termination Fee to SSE.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The merger agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, facilitate, knowingly encourage or induce or take any action that could be reasonably expected to lead to the making, submission or announcement of a proposal competing with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, while our board of directors has the ability, in certain circumstances, to change its recommendation of the transaction to our stockholders, we cannot terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal, and SSE generally has an opportunity to modify the terms of the SSE merger and the merger agreement in response to any alternative proposals that may be made before our board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendation.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay up to $7,500,000 of SSE s expenses or we may be required to pay SSE a termination fee of either $40,000,000 or $100,000,000.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S6	These provisions could discourage a potential third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In addition, these provisions might result in a potential third party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If the merger agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Completion of the SSE M erg er May Trigger Change in Control or Other Provisions in Certain Agreements to Which SSE is a P arty.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The completion of the SSE merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which SSE is a party.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If we and SSE are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Even if we and SSE are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to SSE or the combined company.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	We and SSE May be Unable to Obtain the Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required to Complete the SSE Merger or, in Order to Do So, We May be Required to Comply With Material Restrictions or Conditions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Under the HSR Act, neither we nor SSE may complete the SSE merger until required information and materials are furnished to the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act terminates or expires.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	On January 3, 2017, we and SSE filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P56_S7	On January 13, 2017, we and SSE were notified by the FTC that the early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act had been granted.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The SSE merger may also be subject to the regulatory requirements of other municipal, state, federal, or foreign governmental agencies and authorities.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Regulatory entities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval or in connection with their review.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company without us having the right to refuse to close the SSE merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the necessary clearances or approvals, or that any required conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the SSE merger or result in the abandonment of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Additionally, even after the above-described statutory waiting periods have expired, and even after completion of the SSE merger, governmental authorities could seek to challenge the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S6	The Pendency of the SSE Merger Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Operations.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S7	In connection with the pending SSE merger, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the SSE merger is completed.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S8	Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the SSE merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the SSE merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of our existing employees.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S9	In addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the SSE merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial to us.
889900_17_ITEM1A_P57_S10	Further, the process of seeking to accomplish the SSE merger could also divert the focus of management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, without realizing any of the benefits which might have resulted had the SSE merger been completed.

889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Oil and natural gas prices have recovered substantially from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2016, OPEC and certain non-OPEC countries, including Russia, announced an agreement to cut oil production.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	The announcement resulted in an increase in oil prices, which averaged $51.97 per barrel in December 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S5	In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have been increasing, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2017 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S6	Our rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has steadily improved on a monthly basis since May 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S7	For the fourth quarter, our average rig count improved to 66 rigs in the United States, up from the third quarter average of 60 rigs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S8	Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2016 of 74 rigs was 42% greater than the low of 52 rigs in April 2016; however, it was 65% less than the high of 214 rigs in October 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S9	Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.
889900_17_ITEM7_P0_S10	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 44 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2017 and an average of 37 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Activity levels in our pressure pumping business have also improved.
889900_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Looking forward, we expect to see further increases in activity across the industry, especially in the Permian Basin.
889900_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We have reactivated two frac spreads since mid-December 2016 at a cost of approximately $2 million per spread, including both operating and capital expenditures.
889900_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Approximately 45% of the more than one million hydraulic fracturing horsepower in our fleet remains stacked.
889900_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect the cost to reactivate our remaining idle frac spreads would be approximately $3 million per frac spread, including both operating and capital expenditures.
889900_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	On December 12, 2016, we entered into the merger agreement with SSE, pursuant to which a subsidiary of ours will be merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
889900_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	Under the merger agreement, we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SSE in exchange for approximately 49.6 million shares of our common stock, subject to certain downward adjustments set forth in the merger agreement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	SSE provides contract drilling, pressure pumping and oilfield rental services in many of the most active oil and natural gas plays onshore in the United States.
889900_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	SSE owns a fleet of 40 AC drilling rigs, approximately 93% of which are pad capable, including 28 fit-for purpose PeakeRigs .
889900_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	The remainder of SSE s rig fleet includes 51 SCR rigs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, SSE owns approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in the Anadarko Basin and Eagle Ford Shale.
889900_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The SSE oilfield rentals business has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.
889900_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The completion of the SSE merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, approval by our and SSE s respective stockholders and other closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Subject to closing conditions, the SSE merger is expected to be completed late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Management Overview We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pres sure pumping equipment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.
889900_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas a nd the Appalachian region.
889900_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	We also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets.
889900_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil a nd natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico .
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	There continues to be uncertainty with respect to the global economic environment, and oil and natural gas prices have been depressed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2016, our average number of rigs operating in the United States was 66 compared to an average of 88 drilling rigs operating during the same period in 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2016, our average number of rigs operating in Canada was two compared to an average of three drilling rigs operating during the fourth quarter of 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	As of December 31, 2016, our rig fleet included 161 APEX rigs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	We expect to add two new APEX rigs to our fleet during 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	In connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S7	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.1 million hydraulic horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet (approximately 1.0 million of which was hydraulic fracturing horsepower).
889900_17_ITEM7_P8_S8	We have increased the horsepower of our pressure pumping fleet by more than eight-fold since the beginning of 2009, although we have not ordered or committed to purchase any new horsepower since October 2014 and there is currently no new horsepower on order.
889900_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $417 million and $710 million, respectively.
889900_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	The decrease in backlog at December 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, is primarily due to the revenue earned since December 31, 2015, including revenue from the receipt of early termination payments, and the expiration and termination of certain of our term contracts.
889900_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	Approximately 29% of the total December 31, 2016 backlog is reasonably expected to remain after 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	For the three years ended December 31, 2016, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Generally, the profitability of our business is most impacted by two primary factors in our contract drilling segment: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	During 2016, our average number of rigs operating was 63 in the United States and two in Canada compared to 120 in the United States and four in Canada in 2015, and 203 in the United States and eight in Canada in 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our average rig revenue per operating day was $23,040 in 2016 compared to $25,560 in 2015 and $23,880 in 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	We had a consolidated net loss of $319 million for 2016 compared to consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015 and consolidated net income of $163 million for 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	The financial results for 2015 include pretax non-cash charges totaling approximately $288 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	These charges include $125 million from the impairment of all goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business, $131 million from the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components, $22.0 from the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities and $10.7 million related to the impairment of certain oil and natural gas properties.
889900_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	The financial results for 2014 include a pretax non-cash charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components.
889900_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	During periods of improved commodity pric es, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens a nd we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Oil and natural gas prices and our number of rigs operating have significantly declined from 2014 .
889900_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	In December 201 6 , our average number of rigs operating was 71 in the United States .
889900_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	In January 201 7 , our average number of rigs operating in creased to 7 6 in the United States.
889900_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs).
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	The remaining components of these rigs will be retired.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no impairment charge as we had written down 15 of those rigs in 2015 that remained marketed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and 9 non-APEX electric rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that were not operating.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	Although these 15 rigs remained marketed at that time, we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remained marketed but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S8	In 2014, we identified 55 mechanical rigs that we determined would no longer be marketed, and we recorded a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of these mechanical rigs and the write-off of excess spare components for the reduced size of our mechanical fleet.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S9	We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.
889900_17_ITEM7_P18_S10	There were no similar charges in 2016 or 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives ( triggering events ).
889900_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Based on recent commodity prices, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and management s expectations of operating results in future periods, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 with respect to our contract drilling or pressure pumping segments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our expectations of future operating results were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments will begin to recover by early 2017 in response to improved future oil prices.
889900_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	As a result of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we concluded a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-li ved assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exc eeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approxim ate ly 120% and 60%, respectively.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Due to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to once again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S7	For both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S8	Rigs not under term contracts would be subject to pricing in the spot market.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S9	Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S10	Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.
889900_17_ITEM7_P24_S11	While we believe these assumptions with respect to future pricing for oil and natural gas are reasonable, actual future prices may vary significantly from the ones that were assumed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The timeframe over which oil and natural gas prices will recover is highly uncertain.
889900_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Potential events that could affect our assumptions regarding future prices and the timeframe for a recovery are affected by factors such as:
889900_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	If the current oil and natural gas commodity price environment were to last through 2017 and beyond, our actual cash flows would likely be less than the expected cash flows used in the aforementioned 2015 assessments and could result in impairment charges in the future, and any such impairment charges could be material.
889900_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	We concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 with respect to our contract drilling or pressure pumping segments based on our results of the operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the prevailing commodity prices at that time.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	We first determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if so, the resulting goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test.
889900_17_ITEM7_P28_S5	From time to time, we may perform the first step of the quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The first step of the quantitative testing is to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing is performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of such shortfall.
889900_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative f actors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our contract drilling reporting unit w as greater than its carrying amount and further testing was not necessary.
889900_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	In making this determination, we considered the demand experienced during 2016 for our contract drilling business.
889900_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in this reporting unit, as well as its operating results for 2016 a nd forecasted operating results for 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Lastly, management considered o ur overall market capitalization at December 31, 2016 and the significant amount of calculated excess of the fair value of our reporting unit over its carrying value from our 2015 qu antitative impairment assessment of goodwill.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S6	Based on the results of the Step 1 goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S7	In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S8	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of the goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S9	In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S10	The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S11	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S12	Based on the results of the quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S13	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2014, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their respective carrying amounts and no further testing was deemed necessary.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S14	In making this determination, we considered the continued demand experienced during 2014 for our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S15	We also considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in these reporting units.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S16	Additionally, operating results for 2014 and forecasted operating results for 2015 were also taken into account.
889900_17_ITEM7_P31_S17	Lastly, management considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2014 and the large amount of calculated excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their respective carrying values from our 2013 quantitative impairment assessment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We have undertaken extensive efforts in the past several years to upgrade our fleet of equipment and believe that we are well-positioned from a competitive standpoint to satisfy demand for high technology drilling of unconventional horizontal wells, which should help mitigate decreases in demand for drilling conventional vertical wells.
889900_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	In the event that market conditions were to remain weak for a protracted period, we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit in future periods, and any such impairment could be material.
889900_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenue recognition Revenues from daywork drilling and pressure pumping activities are recognized as services are performed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Expenditures reimbursed by customers are recognized as revenue and the related expenses are recognized as direct costs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	All of the wells we drilled in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were drilled under daywork contracts.
889900_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
889900_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Actual results could differ from such estimates.
889900_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Key estim ates used by management include:
889900_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.
889900_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Oil and natural gas properties Working interests in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determination is made.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells-in-progress until the outcome of the drilling is known.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	We review wells-in-progress quarterly to determine whether sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the respective projects.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	If no progress has been made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of a project after one year following the completion of drilling, we consider the well costs to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense.
889900_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties, are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells, consisting of lease and well equipment and intangible development costs, are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved developed oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the units-of-production method, based on engineering estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves for each respective field.
889900_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs, such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in expected future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are prepared based on our expectation of future pricing over the lives of the respective fields.
889900_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	These cash flow estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.
889900_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	If the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate, impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between net book value and fair value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The fair value estimates used in measuring impairment are based on internally developed unobservable inputs including reserve volumes and future production, pricing and operating costs (Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting).
889900_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an annual rate of 10% to determine fair value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	We review unproved oil and natural gas properties quarterly to assess potential impairment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our impairment assessment is made on a lease-by-lease basis and considers factors such as our intent to drill, lease terms and abandonment of an area.
889900_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	If an unproved property is determined to be impaired, the related property costs are expensed.
889900_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Impairment expense related to both proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaled approximately $2.8 million, $10.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and such amounts are included in depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
889900_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	For additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity as of December 31, 2016 included approximately $18.5 million in working capital and $500 million available under our revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility pursuant to which we exercised approximately $95.8 million of the $100 million commitment increase feature available thereunder in order to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The effectiveness of the aggregate commitment increase is subject to certain conditions, including the consummation of the SSE merger and the repayment and termination of the SSE credit facility, as well as other customary conditions.
889900_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	On January 27, 2017, we completed an offering of 18.2 million shares of our common stock, and we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering of approximately $470 million to fund the repayment of SSE s outstanding net indebtedness upon closing of the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	If the SSE merger is not consummated, we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of outstanding indebtedness or investments in working capital.
889900_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	We believe our current liquidity , together with cash expected to be generated from operations in 2017 , should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improv ements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months .
889900_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	If under current market conditions we desire to pursue opportunities for growth , in addition to the SSE merger, that require capital, we believe we would likely require additional debt or equity financing.
889900_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital of $18.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, compared to working capital of $179 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $113 million, at December 31, 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	During 2016, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	$21.9 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	During 2016, we used $255 million to repay long-term debt, $23.6 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $3.6 million to acquire shares of our common stock, $3.4 million to pay debt issuance costs and $120 million:
889900_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.
889900_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016 as follows:
889900_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid on March 22, 2017 to holders of record as of March 8, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.
889900_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The merger agreement prohibits us (unless consented to in advance by SSE, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) from paying dividends to holders of our common stock in excess of $0.02 per share per quarter until the earlier of the effective time of the SSE merger and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.
889900_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2013 stock buyback program.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Shares purchased under a buyback program are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	We acquired shares of stock from directors in 2016 and from employees during 2016, 2015 and 2014 that are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations upon the exercise of stock options, the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	These shares were acquired at fair market value.
889900_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan or the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.
889900_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Treasury stock acquisitions during the year s ended December 31, 201 6 , 201 5 and 201 4 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	2012 Credit Agreement On September 27, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Base Credit Agreement ).
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Base Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ) is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	On July 8, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 2 ), which amended the Base Credit Agreement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	The revolving credit facility permits aggregate borrowings of up to $500 million outstanding at any time, subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to ours and certain of our subsidiaries eligible equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and unencumbered cash as described in Amendment No. 2.
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $50 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $20 million, in each case outstanding at any time.
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Subject to customary conditions, we may request that the lenders aggregate commitments with respect to the revolving credit facility be increased by up to $100 million, not to exceed total commitments of $600 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P57_S6	The maturity date under the Base Credit Agreement was September 27, 2017 for the revolving credit facility; however, Amendment No. 2 extended the maturity date of $357.9 million in revolving credit commitments of certain lenders to March 27, 2019.
889900_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The term loan facility included in the Base Credit Agreement, which facility was terminated in connection with Amendment No. 2, provided for a loan of $100 million, which was drawn on December 24, 2012 and was payable in quarterly principal installments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	As a condition precedent, Amendment No. 2 required that we repay the entire outstanding principal amount of this term loan.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our availability under the credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S4	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans is 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.75% as of January 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S5	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S6	A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P59_S7	The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the credit facility is 0.50%.
889900_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Each of our domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guarantees all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and ours arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Such guarantees also cover our or any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 40%.
889900_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
889900_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	2 limits our ability to make investments in foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures such that, if the book value of all such investments since September 27, 2012 is above 20% of the total consolidated book value of our consolidated assets on a pro forma b asis, we will not be able to make such investment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	Amendment No. 2 also restricts our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception allowing such restricted payments if before and immediately a fter giving effect to such restricted payment, the Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in Amendment No. 2) is at least 1.50 to 1.00.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, Amendment No. 2 requires that, if our consolidated cash balance, subject to certain exclusions, is more than $100 million at the end of the day on which a borrowing is made, we can only use the proceeds from such borrowing to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and the repurchase of indebtedness, and if such proceeds are not used in such manner within three business days, we must repay such unused proceeds on the fourth business day following such borrowings.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	Amendment No. 2 also decreased the permitted amount of certain secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries and decreased the permitted amount of certain unsecured indebtedness of our subsidiaries.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S4	The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.
889900_17_ITEM7_P64_S5	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Events of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to our insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.
889900_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, with available borrowing capacity of $500 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	On January 17, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 3 ), which amended the Credit Agreement by restating the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for the add-back of transaction expenses related to the SSE merger.
889900_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility pursuant to which we exercised approximately $95.8 million of the $100 million commitment increase feature available thereunder in order to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 million.

889900_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.
889900_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.
889900_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decline in prices for oil and natural gas, together with the reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years, have resulted in an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	Also in recent years, customer demand has shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2016 and 2015 follows:
889900_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating.
889900_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million.

889900_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 included a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components.
889900_17_ITEM7_P89_S4	There were no similar charges in 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P89_S5	Capital expenditures were significantly lower as no new rigs were added to the fleet in 2016 and drilling activity was lower, which required less maintenance capital.
889900_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2016 as a result of declines in both activity and pricing.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	Average revenue per fracturing job and average revenue per other job decreased due to market-related pricing constraints.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Average revenue per total job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of a shift in the job mix toward fracturing jobs.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	Lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S5	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S6	There were no similar charges in 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P91_S7	In addition, all of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Revenues from other operations decreased as a result of lower production and lower oil prices which resulted in lower revenues from our oil and natural gas working interests.
889900_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	Direct operating costs include a reduction in production taxes due to lower revenues.
889900_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	Selling, general and administrative expense increased from 2015 as the 2016 results include costs related to our drilling technology service business which was acquired in September 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2016 includes approximately $2.8 million of oil and natural gas property impairments as compared to approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2015.
889900_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Lower selling, general and administrative expense reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions.
889900_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	Other operating (income) expense, net includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets related to corporate strategy decisions of the executive management group.
889900_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments.
889900_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest, as we reduced our level of capital expenditures in 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	In addition, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of our bank term loans.
889900_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	As a result, we wrote off $1.4 million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016 related to these bank term loans.
889900_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 The following tables summarize operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

889900_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	The decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating.
889900_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million.
889900_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components.
889900_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2014 includes a charge of $77.9 million related to the retirement of mechanical drilling rigs and the write-off of excess spare mechanical rig components.
889900_17_ITEM7_P100_S4	The increase in depreciation expense also reflects significant capital expenditures incurred in recent years to build new drilling rigs, to modify and upgrade existing drilling rigs and to acquire additional related equipment such as top drives, drill pipe, drill collars, engines, fluid circulating systems, rig hoisting systems and safety enhancement equipment.
889900_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.

889900_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Revenues from other operations decreased as a result of lower commodity prices which resulted in lower revenues from our oil and natural gas working interests.
889900_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Direct operating costs include a reduction in production taxes due to lower revenues.
889900_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2015 includes approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments compared to approximately $20.9 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Gains on the disposal of assets are treated as part of our corporate activities because such transactions relate to corporate strategy decisions of our executive management group.
889900_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Interest expense increased primarily due to borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Agreement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is not defined by U.S. GAAP.
889900_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill).
889900_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	We present Adjusted EBITDA (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to both the performance of our fundamental business activities and our ability to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
889900_17_ITEM7_P108_S3	Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss).
889900_17_ITEM7_P108_S4	Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss), the nearest performance measure under U.S. GAAP.
889900_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	The lower 2015 effective rate is primarily related to the impact of goodwill impairment charges in 2015 along with an adjustment to our deferred tax liability associated with the 2010 conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.
889900_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.
889900_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_17_ITEM7_P111_S3	We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $152 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2015 and deferred tax expense of approximately $43.7 million in 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	On January 1, 2010, we converted our Canadian operations from a Canadian branch to a controlled foreign corporation for federal income tax purposes.
889900_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	This transaction triggered a $1.0 million increase in deferred tax liabilities, which is being amortized as an increase to deferred income tax expense over the weighted average remaining useful life of the Canadian assets.
889900_17_ITEM7_P112_S2	This amount was fully amortized as of December 31, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	As a result of the above conversion, our Canadian assets are no longer directly subject to United States taxation, provided that the related unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested in Canada.
889900_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	Effective January 1, 2010, we have elected to permanently reinvest these unremitted earnings in Canada, and we intend to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	As a result, no deferred United States federal or state income taxes have been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings, which totaled approximately $18.8 million as of December 31, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings was approximately $2.5 million, net of available foreign tax credits.
889900_17_ITEM7_P113_S4	This liability would be recognized if we received a dividend of the unremitted earnings.
889900_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	Please see Risk Factors We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S3	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S4	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S5	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S6	Oil and natural gas prices have recovered substantially from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S7	During the fourth quarter of 2016, OPEC and certain non-OPEC countries, including Russia, announced an agreement to cut oil production.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S8	The announcement resulted in an increase in oil prices, which averaged $51.97 per barrel in December 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S9	In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have been increasing, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2017 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S10	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S11	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S12	A continued decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of further decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in further reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S13	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S14	Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P115_S15	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers.
889900_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
889900_17_ITEM7_P116_S2	This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
889900_17_ITEM7_P116_S3	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P116_S4	We expect to adopt this new revenue guidance utilizing the retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of 2018, and because we are still evaluating the portion of our contract drilling revenues that will be subject to the new leasing guidance discussed below, we are unable to quantify the impact that the new revenue standard will have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the accounting for leasing transactions.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	Since a portion of our contract drilling revenue will be subject to this new leasing guidance, we expect to adopt this updated leasing guidance at the same time we adopt the new revenue standard discussed above, utilizing the retrospective method of adoption.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S3	Upon adoption of these two new standards, we expect to have a lease component and a service component of revenue related to our drilling contracts.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S4	We are still evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S5	This new leasing guidance will also impact us in situations where we are the lessee, and in certain circumstances we will need to record a right-of-use asset and lease liability on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_17_ITEM7_P117_S6	We have not quantified the impact of this guidance to such situations, although we expect the future minimum rental payments disclosed in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements will provide some visibility into our estimated adoption impact.
889900_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance for the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets.
889900_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Under this guidance, for a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount.
889900_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P118_S3	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidan ce for the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the related income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
889900_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
889900_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	We believe this guidance will cause volatility in our effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share due to the tax effects related to share-based payments being recorded i n the income statement.
889900_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	The volatility in future periods will depend on our stock price and the number of shares that vest in the case of restricted stock , or the number of shares that are exercised in the case of stock options.
889900_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard to clarify the presentation of cash receipts and payments in specific situations on the statement of cash flows.
889900_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75%.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 1.75% as of January 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2016, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2017.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Under the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S8	We are obligated to pay to the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S9	As of December 31, 2016, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P0_S10	We conduct a portion of our business in Canadian dollars through our Canadian land-based drilling operations and our Warrior Rig Technologies Limited subsidiary.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.
889900_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
889900_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

889900_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	Concurrent with the closing of the merger, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of SSE totaling $472 million.
889900_18_ITEM1_P3_S4	Based on the closing price of our common stock on April 20, 2017, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of SSE was approximately $1.5 billion.
889900_18_ITEM1_P3_S5	On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary named Seventy Sev en Energy LLC ( SSE LLC ), with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly - owned subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Through the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas.
889900_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.
889900_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Operational data in the discussion and analysis in this Report includes the results of operations of the MS Directional business since October 11, 2017 and the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Quarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are as follows:
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S4	Our rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has improved since the second quarter of 2016.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S5	Our average rig count in the United States was 159 rigs for both the third and fourth quarter of 2017, with the third quarter of 2017 being the first quarter with a full quarter contribution from the rigs acquired in the SSE merger.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S6	Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2017 was 163 rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S7	Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S8	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 96 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2018 and an average of 67 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2018.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S9	Activity levels in our pressure pumping business also improved during 2017, especially in the Permian Basin.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S10	We reactivated two frac spreads during the third quarter and one additional frac spread during the fourth quarter.
889900_18_ITEM1_P7_S11	With the addition of these three frac spreads, we exited 2017 with 23 active frac spreads or approximately 1.25 million active fracturing horsepower.
889900_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Industry Segments Our revenues, operating income (loss) and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to two industry segments:
889900_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our contract drilling services industry segment had operating losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
889900_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our pressure pumping services industry segment had operating income in 2017 and operating losses in 2016 and 2015.
889900_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our third industry segment, directional drilling services, is a new segment for us as a result of the MS Directional acquisition and accounted for approximately two percent of our 2017 consolidated revenues.
889900_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidat ed Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
889900_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We market our contract drilling services to major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had 295 marketed land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:
889900_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our marketed drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from approximately 13,200 feet to 25,000 feet.
889900_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	All of these drilling rigs are electric rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	An electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines into electricity to power the rig.
889900_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as upgrades or replacement parts for marketed rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, top drives, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt.
889900_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	We have spent approximately $954 million during the last three years on capital expenditures to (1) build new land drilling rigs and (2) modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet.
889900_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $354 million, $73 million and $527 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
889900_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Depth and complexity of the well, drill site conditions and the number of wells to be drilled on a pad are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
889900_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel.
889900_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Drilling Contracts Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our drilling contracts are either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (frequently six months to two years) and provide for the use of the drilling rig to drill multiple wells.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	During 2017, our average number of days to drill a well (which includes moving to the drill site, rigging up and rigging down) was approximately 15 days.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S6	Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S7	Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S8	Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis.
889900_18_ITEM1_P17_S9	Under daywork contracts, we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer.
889900_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The customer provides the program for the drilling of the well.
889900_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized.
889900_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control.
889900_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
889900_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	All of the wells we drilled in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were under daywork contracts.
889900_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	From time to time more than five y ears ago, we contracted to drill some wells to a certain depth under specified conditions for a fixed price per foot (on a footage basis) or for a fixed fee (on a turnkey basis).
889900_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	We generally assume greater operational and economic risk drilling on a turn key basis than on a footage basis and greater operational and economic risk drilling on a footage basis than on a daywork basis.
889900_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Contract Drilling Activity Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:
889900_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Drilling Rigs and Related Equipment We have made significant upgrades during the last several years to our drilling fleet to match the needs of our customers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	While conventional wells remain a source of oil and natural gas, our customers have expanded the development of shale and other unconventional wells to help supply the long-term demand for oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	To address our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have expanded our areas of operation and improved the capability of our drilling fleet.
889900_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	We have delivered new APEX rigs to the market and have made performance and safety improvements to existing high capacity rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	APEX rigs are electric rigs with advanced electronic drilling systems, 500 ton top drives, iron roughnecks, hydraulic catwalks, and other automated pipe handling equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	APEX rigs that are pad capable are designed to efficiently drill multiple wells from a single pad, by walking between the wellbores without requiring time to lower the mast and lay down the drill pipe.
889900_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our marketed land-based drilling fleet was comprised of the following:
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The U.S. land rig industry has recently begun referring to certain high specification rigs as super-spec rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We consider a super-spec rig to be a 1,500 horsepower, AC powered rig that has a 750,000 pound hookload, has a 7,500 psi circulating system and is pad capable.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	We currently estimate there are approximately 550 super-spec rigs in the United States, which includes 130 of our APEX rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	We perform repair and/or overhaul work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and western Canada.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S4	We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas (West and South Regions) and the Mid-Continent (Mid-Con Region) and Appalachian regions (Northeast Region).
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S5	Pressure pumping services consist of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) and cementing services for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S6	Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S7	This is accomplished by pumping fluids under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation.
889900_18_ITEM1_P26_S8	Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services.
889900_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing.
889900_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract.
889900_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum rev enue, usage or stage requirements.
889900_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
889900_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Equipment We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic fracturing services as well as nitrogen, cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 1.6 million horsepower as of December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2017 included:
889900_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
889900_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time.
889900_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	We purchase these materials from various suppliers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that do not cover all of our required supply and sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material.
889900_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material, or should one of our suppliers fail to timely deliver our materials.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Directional Drilling Operations General We generally utilize our own proprietary downhole motors and equipment to provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, directional surveying, measurement while drilling ( MWD ), and wireline steering tools, in most major onshore oil and natural gas basins in the United States.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We generally design, manufacture and maintain our own fleet of downhole drilling motors and MWD equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	We occasionally rent motors and equipment from third parties during periods in which we experience shortages from our vendors, which can occur during periods of increased industry activity.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	As a complement to our core directional drilling services, we provide downhole survey services and rent our proprietary drilling motors to both oil and natural gas operators and other oilfield service companies.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	Our customers primarily consist of major integrated energy companies and large North American independent oil and natural gas operators.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S5	We believe our customers use our services because of the quality of our specialized, technology-driven equipment and our well-trained and experienced workforce, which enable us to provide our customers with high-quality, reliable and safe directional drilling services.
889900_18_ITEM1_P31_S6	We utilize our fleet of directional drilling motors, MWD equipment and survey equipment to provide: (1) directional drilling services, (2) third-party motor rentals and (3) downhole survey services.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	We provide our directional drilling services on a day-rate basis, typically under master service agreements.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Revenue from directional drilling services is recognized as work progresses based on the numbe r of days of work completed.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our day rates and other charges generally vary by location and depend on the equipment and personnel required for the job and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition to rates that are charged during periods of active directional drilling, a stand-by rate is typically agreed upon in advance and charged on a daily basis during periods when drilling is temporarily suspended while other on-site activity is conducted at the direction of the operator or another service provider.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S4	We rent our drilling motors on an hourly- or day-rate basis to complement our directional drilling services and optimize the utilization of our asset base.
889900_18_ITEM1_P32_S5	Our third-party motor rental revenue is recognized as work progresses based on the number of days or hours our motors are used or are on location.
889900_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Downhole Survey Services We provide our downhole survey services on a day-rate, hourly-rate or completed-job basis.
889900_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Revenue for our downhole survey services is recognized upon the completion of each day s work.
889900_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our downhole survey services are typically non-contractual.
889900_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	We normally provide a quote to our customers in advance and then issue an invoice for the downhole survey services provided based on a completed field ticket.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Equipment We generally design, manufacture, maintain and inspect our own equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We occasionally rent motors and equipment from third parties during periods in which we experience shortages from our vendors, which can occur during periods of increased industry activity.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	We have developed proprietary equipment for our drilling motors, mud pulse and electromagnetic data transfer MWD equipment and survey tools.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	We believe that our vertical integration strategy allows us to deliver better operational performance and higher equipment reliability to our customers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S4	Vertical integration also allows us to build our tools more efficiently and at a lower cost than if purchased from third parties.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S5	In addition, we have th e ability to upgrade our tools in response to market conditions or our customers job requirements, which allows us to minimize the costs and delays associated with sending equipment to original manufacturers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S6	Our internal maintenance capability also affords us enhanced control over our supply chain and increases the effective utilization of our assets.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S7	As of December 31, 2017, we had a comprehensive fleet of over 1,600 motors that serve both internal needs and external motor rental requirements.
889900_18_ITEM1_P34_S8	In addition to our motor fleet, we had 112 MWD systems as well as downhole surveying equipment to provide accurate wellbore surveys.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Oilfield Rentals Our oilfield rentals business has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	We offer an extensive line of rental tools, including a full line of tubular products specifically designed for horizontal drilling and completion, with high-torque, premium-connection drill pipe, drill collars and tubing.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	Additionally, we offer surface rental equipment including blowout preventers, frac tanks, mud tanks and environmental containment that encompass all phases of the hydrocarbon extraction and production process.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our air drilling equipment and services enable extraction in select basins where certain segments of formations preclude the use of drilling fluid, permitting operators to drill through problematic zones without the risk of fluid absorption and damage to the wellbore.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S4	We also provide frac-support services, including delivery of on-site frac water through a water transfer operation using innovative lay-flat pipe, and monitoring and controlling of production returns.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S5	We offer oilfield rental services in many of the major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S6	We price our rentals and services based on the type of equipment being rented and the services being performed.
889900_18_ITEM1_P35_S7	Substantially all rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for the actual period of time the rental is provided to our customer on a market-based, fixed per-day or per-hour fee.
889900_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Contracts We believe that our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and oilfield rentals contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	However, each contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer requirements, applicable law or other factors.
889900_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Customers Our customer base includes major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators.
889900_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2017, we received approximately 43% from our ten largest customers and approximately 29% from our five largest customers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	During 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues.
889900_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Backlog Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $544 million and $417 million, respectively.
889900_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Approximately 19% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2017 is reasonably expected to remain after 2018.
889900_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as a part of Item 7 of this Report for information pertaining to backlog.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Historically, available equipment used in these businesses has frequently exceeded demand, particularly in an industry downturn, such as the current market environment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in our businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment, quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S4	We expect that the market for our services will continue to be highly competitive.
889900_18_ITEM1_P39_S5	Government and Environmental Regulation All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including:
889900_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	To date, applicable environmental laws and regulations in the places in which we operate have not required the expenditure of significant resources outside the ordinary course of business.
889900_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future.
889900_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations currently apply to our operations and may become more stringent in the future.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	Any limitation, suspension or moratorium of the services we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S5	However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S6	Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S7	In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S8	We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S9	In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
889900_18_ITEM1_P41_S10	Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
889900_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites.
889900_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of hazardous wastes.
889900_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions by Congress under both CERCLA and RCRA may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future.
889900_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	For example, in December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA.
889900_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking by March 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D crite ria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.
889900_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	If changes are made to the classification of exploration and production wastes under CERCLA and/or RCRA, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
889900_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, each as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
889900_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	liability for drainage into such waters.
889900_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities.
889900_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.
889900_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
889900_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters.
889900_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions.
889900_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Federal Water Pollution Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
889900_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees.
889900_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens.
889900_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
889900_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether.
889900_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	In Canada, a variety of federal, provincial and municipal laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply.
889900_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.
889900_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications.
889900_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
889900_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
889900_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
889900_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	For more information, please refer to our discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Environmental and Occupatio nal Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and climate change issues.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S5	Risks and Insurance Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S6	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S7	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S8	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S9	In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S10	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S11	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S12	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S13	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S14	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S15	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S16	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S17	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S18	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S19	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S20	We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S21	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S22	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S23	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S24	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S25	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S26	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S27	If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S28	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_18_ITEM1_P55_S29	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Employees We had approximately 8,000 full-time employees as of February 16, 2018.
889900_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
889900_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	None of our employees are represented by a union.
889900_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Seasonality Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations.
889900_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	However, our drilling operations in Canada are subject to slow periods of activity during the annual spring thaw.
889900_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Additionally, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers capital expenditure budgets are depleted.
889900_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
889900_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Raw Materials and Subcontractors We use many suppliers of raw materials and services.
889900_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all.
889900_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We depend on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	When these expenditures decline, our business may suffer.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Prices, and expectations about future prices, are affected by factors such as:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the price and availability of alternative fuels.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	All of these factors are beyond our control.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	As a result of the lower level of oil prices, our industry has experienced a severe decline in both contract drilling and pressure pumping activity levels.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	While oil and natural gas prices modestly recovered since the first quarter of 2016, and we have experienced an increase in the demand for our services since 2016, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a portion of our pressure pumping horsepower remains stacked.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Global economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to, or an inability to obtain, financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and result in reduced demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability or unwillingness to pay suppliers, including us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins and the Carrying Value of our Assets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The North American land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive, and at times available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A low commodity price environment can result in substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment being available than are needed to meet demand.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment and the improvement of existing drilling rigs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Low commodity prices and construction of new equipment and the improvement of existing drilling rigs can result in excess capacity and substantial competition for a declining number of drilling and pressure pumping contracts.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, reactivation and improvement of existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, construction of new technology drilling rigs and new pressure pumping equipment, and movement of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from region to region in response to market conditions or otherwise can lead to an excess supply of equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	In addition, we may be unable to replace fixed-term contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Accordingly, high competition and excess equipment can cause drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling contractors to have difficulty maintaining utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas contract drilling, pressure pumping or directional drilling businesses or the level of demand for our contract drilling, pressure pumping or directional drilling services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The excess supply of operable land drilling rigs, increasing rig specialization and excess pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which has been exacerbated by a decline in oil and natural gas prices could affect the fair market value of our drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling equipment, which in turn could result in additional impairments of our assets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets and goodwill.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provis ions May Not Fully Protect Us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In general, our customer contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as oilfield anti-indemnity acts expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party s indemnification of us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers compensation and insurance for other specific risks.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and cyber risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S14	As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S15	There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S16	Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P11_S17	Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	On January 22, 2018, an accident at a drilling site in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma resulted in the losses of life of five people, including three of our employees.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Based on the information we have available as of the date of this Report, we believe that we have adequate insurance to cover any losses, excluding the applicable insurance deductibles and investigation-related expenses.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	However, if this accident is not, or another significant accident or other event occurs that is not, fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Cont racts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate or renegotiate or otherwise fail to honor their contractual obligations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	In addition, the termination or renegotiation of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S7	As of December 31, 2017, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $544 million.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Our contract drilling backlog may decline, as fixed-term drilling contract coverage over time may not be offset by new contracts, including as a result of the decline in the price of oil and natural gas, capital spending reductions by our customers or other factors.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S9	For these and other reasons, our contract drilling backlog may not generate sufficient liquidity for us during periods of reduced demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S10	New Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods, Equipment and Services to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in Our Industry.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S11	The market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of drilling rigs and other equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S12	Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and other equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S14	In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S15	Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping and directional drilling businesses could have similar effects.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S16	In recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, purchased new pressure pumping equipment and acquired a directional drilling services company.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S17	We have also improved existing drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment by adding equipment designed to enhance functionality and performance.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S18	Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling technology, changes in technology, improvements in competitors equipment and changes relating to the wells to be drilled and completed could make our equipment less competitive.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S19	If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our services may decline.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S20	If any technology that we need to successfully compete is not available to us or that we implement in the future does not work as we expect, we may be adversely affected.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S21	Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our equipment and services obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S22	Shortages, Delays in Delivery, and Interruptions in Supply, of Equipment and Materials Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S23	During periods of increased demand for oilfield services, the industry has experienced shortages of equipment for upgrades, drill pipe, replacement parts and other equipment and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S24	These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S25	In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P13_S26	Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	a shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties or bankruptcies or consolidation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	These price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to operate, maintain, upgrade and construct our drilling rigs and pressure pumping and other equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Loss of Key Personnel and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Neg atively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly after a prolonged industry downturn.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	During periods of lower demand for our services, we may experience reductions in force and voluntary departures of key personnel, which could adversely affect our business and make it more it difficult to meet customer demands when demand for our services improves.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	In addition, even if it is generally a period of lower demand for our services, if there is a high demand for our services in certain areas, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform services in such areas.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	The loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel and the increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	The Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2017, we received approximately 43% from our ten largest customers, 29% from our five largest customers and 8% from our largest customer.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S11	The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Growth Through Acquisitions or the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment Is Not Assured.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping fleet and expanded our business lines in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, we completed the SSE merger and the MS Directional acquisition during 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, improved commodity prices may cause contract drillers to continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services to continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, we may incur liabilities arising from events prior to any acquisitions or prior to our establishment of adequate compliance oversight.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	While we generally seek to obtain indemnities for liabilities for events occurring before such acquisitions, these are limited in amount and duration, may be held to be unenforceable or the seller may not be able to indemnify us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulatio ns, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, a manufacturer and servicer of oilfield service equipment and a provider of directional drilling services, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAPS ) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates and expands the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, the EPA has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The EPA also published a final rule in June 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In November 2016, the Department of the Interior issued final rules relating to the venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas by oil and natural gas producers who operate on federal and Indian lands.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The rules limited routine flaring of natural gas, require the payment of royalties on avoidable gas losses and require plans or programs relating to gas capture and leak detection and repair.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The EPA issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017 and has indicated that the requirements could be rescinded or significantly revised in the future.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These or other initiatives could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Members of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	For example, the EPA conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on hydraulic fracturing practices.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	The EPA released its final report in December 2016.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Further, we conduct drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling activities in numerous states.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) and other aspects of the oil and gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, legi slation has been proposed, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydrau lic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process are impairing ground water or causing other damage.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These bills, if enacted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Regulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain diesel fuel under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on Indian land.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The rule requires companies to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the BLM.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	However, these rules were rescinded by rule in December 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, in light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ( OCC ) has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK plays that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Finally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P30_S7	In June 2015, New York banned high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Voters in the city of Denton, Texas approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in November 2014, though it was later lifted in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The Design, Manufacture, Sale and Servicing of Products, including Rig Components, May Subject Us to Liability for Personal Injury, Property Damage and Environmental Contamination Should Such Equipment Fail to Perform to Specifications.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We provide products, including rig components such as top drives, to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Because of applications which use our products and services, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination, leading to claims against us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( PSD ) and Title V programs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	However, in June 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court in UARG v. EPA limited application of this rule to sources that would otherwise need permits based on emission of conventional pollutants.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In April 2015, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the rule in accordance with the Supreme C ourt s decision.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydrauli cally fractured oil wells.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Also, in November 2016, the EPA published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, ev ery five years.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement unless it is renegotiated.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The State Department informed the United Nations of the United States withdrawal in August 2017.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	However, s everal states and geographic regions in the United States have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the Uni ted States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Any d irect and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S10	Legal Proceedings and Governmental Investigations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S11	The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S12	For example, the January 22, 2018 accident at a drilling site in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma is currently under governmental investigation by the EPA, OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S13	In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S14	Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S15	Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S16	Technology Disputes Could Negatively Impact Our Operations or Increase Our Costs.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S17	Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party s rights, including patent rights.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S18	The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and directional drilling services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S19	However, in the event that we or one of our supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement rights relating to equipment owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or forced to modify our equipment, services or products.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S20	We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or provision of services or products.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S21	Technology disputes involving us or our supplying vendors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S22	Political, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Opportunities and Future Business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S23	We currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P37_S24	Also, we sell products, including rig components, for use in numerous oil and gas producing regions outside of North America.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements, or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effe ct on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may b e conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our op erations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	There can be no assurance that we will:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	receive awards for work and successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Some parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted or where our consumers for the Warrior products are located have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations, and we also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	The occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Our Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:
889900_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	As a result, the occurrence of a cyber in cident could go unnoticed for a period time.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long-Term Debt.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Variable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 3.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 2.50%.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we had $268 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 5.71%.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have in place a reimbursement agreement pursuant to which we are required to reimburse the issuing bank on demand for any amounts that it has disbursed under any of our letters of credit issued thereunder.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We are obligated to pay the issuing bank interest on all amounts not paid by us on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	A Downgrade in Our Credit Rating Could Negatively Impact Our Cost of and Ability to Access Capital.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, commodity pricing levels and other considerations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability in the future to access debt markets, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Cash to Service All of Our Debt, Including Our Senior Notes and Debt Under Our Credit Agreement, and We May Be Forced to Take Other Actions to Satisfy Our Obligations Under Our Debt, which May Not Be Successful.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S7	We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S8	In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S9	We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S10	In the absence of such cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S11	However, our Credit Agreement and senior notes contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P47_S12	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Anti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	F ollowing its Spin-Off from CHK.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of CHK s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before June 30, 2014, the effective time of SSE s spin-off, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	SSE has entered into a tax sharing agreement with CHK that allocates the responsibility for prior year taxes of CHK s consolidated tax reporting group between SSE and CHK and its subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, if CHK were unable to pay, SSE nevertheless could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	SSE s Tax Sharing Agreement Limits its Ability to Take Certain Actions and May Require SSE to Indemnify CHK for Significant Tax Liabilities Which Cannot be Precisely Quantified at This Time.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Under the terms of SSE s tax sharing agreement with CHK, SSE generally is responsible for all taxes attributable to its business, whether accruing before, on or after the date of the spin-off, and CHK generally is responsible for any taxes arising from the spin-off or certain related transactions that are imposed on SSE, CHK or its other subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Although CHK generally will be responsible for any taxes arising from the spin-off, SSE would be responsible for any such taxes to the extent such taxes result from certain actions or failures to act by SSE that occur after June 30, 2014, the effective date of the tax sharing agreement.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	SSE s liabilities under the tax sharing agreement could have a material adverse effect on us.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	At this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of liabilities SSE may have under the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, in the tax sharing agreement SSE covenanted not to take any action, or fail to take any action, after the effective date of the tax sharing agreement, which action or failure to act is inconsistent with the spin-off qualifying under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	As a result, SSE might determine to continue to operate certain of its business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business might otherwise have been advantageous.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In Connection with SSE s Separation from CHK, CHK Indemnified SSE for Certain Liabilities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	However, There Can Be No Assurance that the Indemnities Will be Sufficient to Insure SSE Against the Full Amount of Such Liabilities, or That CHK s Ability to Satisfy its Indemnification Obligation Will Not Be Impaired in the Future.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, CHK agreed to indemnify SSE for certain liabilities.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	However, third parties could seek to hold SSE responsible for any of the liabilities that CHK has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from CHK will be sufficient to protect SSE against the full amount of such liabilities, or that CHK will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Moreover, even if SSE ultimately succeeds in recovering from CHK any amounts for which SSE is held liable, SSE may be temporarily required to bear these losses.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, in certain circumstances, SSE will be prohibited from making an indemnity claim until it first seeks an insurance recovery.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If CHK is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We May Not Be Able to Utilize a Portion of SSE s or Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards ( NOLs ) to Offset Future Taxable Income for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Net Income and Cash Flows.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As of December 31, 2017, SSE had federal income tax NOLs of approximately $238.0 million, which will expire between 2034 and 2037, and, as of December 31, 2017, we had federal income tax NOLs of approximately $867.1 million, which will expire between 2035 and 2037.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be predicted with any accuracy.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, Section 382 of the Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an ownership change (as determined under Section 382).
889900_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the corporation s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In the event that an ownership change has occurred or were to occur with respect to a corporation following its recognition of an NOL, utilization of such NOL would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, generally determined by multiplying the value of the corporation s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	However, this annual limitation would be increased under certain circumstances by recognized built-in gains of the corporation existing at the time of the ownership change.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Any unused annual limitation with respect to an NOL generally may be carried over to later years, subject to the expiration of the NOL 20 years after it arose.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	SSE underwent an ownership change in 2016 as a result of its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and experienced another ownership change in 2017 as a result of its acquisition pursuant to the SSE merger, and the corresponding annual limitation associated with either of those changes in ownership could prevent us from fully utilizing prior to their expiration SSE s NOLs as of the effective time of the SSE merger.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	While our issuance of stock pursuant to the SSE merger was, standing alone, insufficient to result in an ownership change with respect to us, we cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change as a result of the merger taking into account other changes in ownership of our stock occurring within the relevant three-year period described above.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S6	If we were to undergo an ownership change, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs as of the time of the SSE merger prior to their expiration.
889900_18_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Future changes in stock ownership or future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize SSE s or our NOLs.

889900_18_ITEM7_P2_S6	Through the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX rigs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P2_S7	Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas.
889900_18_ITEM7_P2_S8	The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities.
889900_18_ITEM7_P2_S9	Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P2_S10	Quarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are as follows:
889900_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Our rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has improved since the second quarter of 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our average rig count in the United States was 159 rigs for both the third and fourth quarter of 2017, with the third quarter of 2017 being the first quarter with a full quarter contribution from the rigs acquired in the SSE merger.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S6	Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2017 was 163 rigs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S7	Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years.
889900_18_ITEM7_P5_S8	Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 96 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2018 and an average of 67 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2018.
889900_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Activity levels in our pressure pumping business also improved during 2017, especially in the Permian Basin.
889900_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We reactivated two frac spreads during the third quarter, and one additional frac spread during the fourth quarter.
889900_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	With the addition of these three frac spreads, we exited 2017 with 23 active frac spreads or approximately 1.25 million active fracturing horsepower.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States, and we also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	We have addressed our customers needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S7	As of December 31, 2017, our rig fleet included 199 APEX rigs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S8	In connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, in the last five years we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P7_S9	As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.6 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet.
889900_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $544 million and $417 million, respectively.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Approximately 19% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2017 is reasonably expected to remain after 2018.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S6	For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P9_S7	See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.
889900_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services.
889900_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
889900_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	For the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Generally, the revenues in our contract drilling segment are most impacted by two primary factors: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day.
889900_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	During 2017, our average number of rigs operating was 136 in the United States and two in Canada, compared to 63 in the United States and two in Canada in 2016, and 120 in the United States and four in Canada in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our average rig revenue per operating day was $20,620 in 2017, compared to $23,040 in 2016 and $25,560 in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Generally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials ) of those jobs , which is reflected in our average revenue per fracturing job.
889900_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	We completed 622 fracturing jobs during 2017 compared to 352 fracturing jobs in 2016 and 610 fracturing jobs in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.894 million in 2017 compared to $982,560 in 2016 and $1.118 million in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	For the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
889900_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Discussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the Results of Operations section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	On December 22, 2017, significant U.S. tax law changes were enacted ( tax reform ).
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Tax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax reform, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 of approximately $219 million of tax benefit as a result of tax reform, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to the impact of tax reform.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	The improvement in demand for our services and the income tax rate change resulted in consolidated net income of $5.9 million for 2017 compared to a consolidated net loss of $319 million for 2016 and a consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P15_S6	Results of Operations Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 The following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Operating days and average rigs operating increased due to a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry and the rigs acquired in the SSE merger.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased due to the additional SSE assets and due to a $29.0 million impairment from the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	There was no similar charge in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	Average revenue per operating day decreased during 2017 due to a reduction in early termination revenue and the expiration of higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S5	Early termination revenue in 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S6	Average direct operating costs per operating day increased as a result of a reduction in the proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig reactivation expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P20_S7	Capital expenditures increased due to upgrading rigs to super-spec capability, building a new rig, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other general property and equipment upgrades.
889900_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.

889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs in creased in 201 7 primarily due to a n in crease in the number and size of fracturing jobs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	T he total number of jobs in creased as a result of the SSE merger and a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Average revenue per job increased due to improved pricing and an increase in the size of the jobs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily due to the increase in the size of the jo bs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S4	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the increase in organizational size and activity as a result of the SSE merger .
889900_18_ITEM7_P22_S5	The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher maintenance capital expenditures as a result of higher activity and investments to reactivate frac spreads.
889900_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our directional drilling segment originated with the October 11, 2017 acquisition of MS Directional, and consequently we have no results for the prior year in this segment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues, direct operating costs, selling, general and administrative expense and depreciation expense from other operations increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rental business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017 and our pipe handling components and related technology business acquired in September 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in the oilfield rental business and in oil and natural gas working interests.
889900_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling, general and administration expense increased in 2017 primarily due to the personnel added as a result of the SSE merger .
889900_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The merger and integration expenses incurred in 2017 are related to the SSE merger and MS Directional acquisition .
889900_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Other operating income includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets.
889900_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Accordingly, the re lated gains or losses have been excluded from th e results of specific segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	The 2017 period includes a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real estate and $8.4 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties .
889900_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Interest income increased due to our investment of the proceeds from our stock offering in the first quarter of 2017 prior to utilizing those proceeds to repay SSE indebtedness .
889900_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt outstanding during 2017 compared to 2016 .
889900_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 The following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
889900_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days.
889900_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas.
889900_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand.
889900_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Customer demand shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2016 and 2015 follows:
889900_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Early termination revenues were approximately $24.6 million in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 included a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	There were no similar charges in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	Capital expenditures were significantly lower as no new rigs were added to the fleet in 2016 and drilling activity was lower, which required less maintenance capital.
889900_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2016 as a result of declines in both activity and pricing.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Average revenue per fracturing job and average revenue per other job decreased due to market-related pricing constraints.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	Average revenue per total job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of a shift in the job mix toward fracturing jobs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	Lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S6	There were no similar charges in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P36_S7	In addition, all of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Revenues from other operations decreased as a result of lower production and lower oil prices which resulted in lower revenues from our oil and natural gas working interests.
889900_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Direct operating costs include a reduction in production taxes due to lower revenues.
889900_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Selling, general and administrative expense increased from 2015 as the 2016 results include costs related to our drilling technology service business which was acquired in September 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2016 includes approximately $2.8 million of oil and natural gas property impairments as compared to approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Lower selling, general and administrative expense reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Other operating (income) expense, net includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets related to corporate strategy decisions of the executive management group.
889900_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest, as we reduced our level of capital expenditures in 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of our bank term loans.
889900_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	As a result, we expensed $1.4 million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016 related to these bank term loans.
889900_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:
889900_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The effective tax rate increased by approximately 66.0% to 101.8% for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a 66.7% increase related to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and a 3.6% increase for excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation deductions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	These increases were partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in the effective tax rate for acquisitions that resulted in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new state tax rates at which they are expected to reverse.
889900_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The lower 2015 effective rate is primarily related to the impact of goodwill impairment charges in 2015 along with an adjustment to our deferred tax liability associated with the 2010 conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Tax reform reduces the U .
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a new limitation on the tax deduc tibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes.
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Based on a reduced US federal corporate tax rate of 21% from tax reform, we remea sured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	Due to the limited time to consider tax reform and its various interpretations, we are still analyzing and refining our calculations, w hich could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	F or the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount , in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 , of approximately $ 219 million of tax benefit , which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations resulting in the above impact to our 2017 effective tax rate .
889900_18_ITEM7_P43_S5	See Note 1 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to th e impact of tax reform .
889900_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Prior to tax reform, we had elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intended to do so for the foreseeable future.
889900_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result, no deferred U.S. federal or state income taxes had been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	With the enactment of tax reform, there is a new territorial tax system that provides for a 100% dividends received deduction on future earnings, if remitted.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	However, we will need to continue to evaluate our reinvestment intentions on future earnings and any other residual basis differences in order to determine whether we can continue to assert indefinite reinvestment or whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes that would be due on future earnings if remitted, such as foreign withholding taxes or state and local taxes.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	We will also need to determine whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes on any other outside basis differences in our foreign operations.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Due to the limited time to consider these provisions, we are still evaluating how tax reform will affect our existing accounting position to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment with respect to future unremitted earnings and have not recorded any deferred federal or state income taxes that would be provided on future unremitted earnings.
889900_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	We will finalize our intentions on whether we will permanently reinvest our foreign unremitted earnings within the measurement period provided under SAB 118.
889900_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.
889900_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled.
889900_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized.
889900_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $330 million in 2017, $152 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASU 2016-09).
889900_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The new standard was effective for us on January 1, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Among other provisions, the new standard requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement.
889900_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	Previously, such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in-capital.
889900_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	This aspect of the new guidance was required to be adopted prospectively.
889900_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the period.
889900_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	During 2017, we had significant merger and acquisition activity.
889900_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Based on this activity, we evaluated our overall state deferred tax rate, resulting in a slightly increased rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and recorded additional taxes of approximately $11 million, resulting in the above impact to the 2017 effective tax rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity as of December 31, 2017 included approximately $201 million in working capital, including $42.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $227 million available under our revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	We believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations in 2018, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.
889900_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing.
889900_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
889900_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $201 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million, compared to negative working capital of $17.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, at December 31, 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	During 2017, our sources of cash flow included:
889900_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	$472 million from net proceeds from common stock issuance.
889900_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	During 2017, we used $502 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of SSE and MS Directional, $16.3 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $6.8 million to acquire shares of our common stock and $567 million:
889900_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.
889900_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:
889900_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	On February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid on March 22, 2018 to holders of record as of March 8, 2018.
889900_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.
889900_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	On September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Purchases under the program are made at management s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Purchases may be made at any time without prior notice.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Shares of stock purchased under the plan are held as treasury shares.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	There is no expiration date associated with the buyback program.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2013 stock buyback program.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S5	We acquired shares of stock from directors in 2017 and 2016 and from employees during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that are accounted for as treasury stock.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S6	Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S7	The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S8	These shares were acquired at fair market value.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S9	These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.
889900_18_ITEM7_P58_S10	Treasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):
889900_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	2012 Credit Agreement On September 27, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Base Credit Agreement ).
889900_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Base Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ) is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	On July 8, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 2 ), which amended the Base Credit Agreement to, among other things, make borrowings under the revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to our and certai n of our subsidiaries eligible equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and unencumbered cash as described in Amendment No. 2.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $50 million and a swing line facility th at is limited to $20 million, in each case outstanding at any time.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The maturity date under the Base Credit Agreement was September 27, 2017 for the revolving credit facility; however, Amendment No. 2 extended the maturity date of $357.9 million in revolv ing credit commitments of certain lenders to March 27, 2019.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	On January 17, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement by restating the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for the add-back of tra nsaction expenses related to the SSE merger.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 milli on, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	The aggregate commitment increase became effective on April 20, 2017 upon the consummation of the SSE merger and the repayment and termination of the SSE credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	On April 20, 2017, we entere d into Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement which permitted outstanding letters of credit under the SSE credit facility to be deemed to be incurred under our credit facility and increased the amount of the accordion feature of our revolving credit facility to permit aggregate commitments to be increased to an amount not to exceed $700 million (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders).
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S6	On April 20, 2017, we also entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to both commitment increases) increased to $632 million through September 2017 and t o $490 million through March 2019.
889900_18_ITEM7_P61_S7	On October 27, 2017, we entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility increased to $500 million thro ugh March 27, 2019.
889900_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varied from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varied from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio.
889900_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 3.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 2.50%.
889900_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 0.50%.
889900_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Each of our domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guarantees all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and ours arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million.
889900_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Such guarantees also cover our or any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.
889900_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 40%.
889900_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Credit Agreement limits our ability to make investments in foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures such that, if the book value of all such investments since September 27, 2012 is above 20% of our total consolidated book value of the assets on a pro forma basis, we will not be able to make such investment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception allowing such restricted payments if before and immediately after giving effect to such restricted payment, the Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is at least 1.50 to 1.00.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, if our consolidated cash balance, subject to certain exclusions, is more than $100 million at the end of the day on which a borrowing is made, we can only use the proceeds from such borrowing to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and the repurchase of indebtedness, and if such proceeds are not used in such manner within three business days, we must repay such unused proceeds on the fourth business day following such borrowings.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.
889900_18_ITEM7_P67_S6	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Events of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and re quire us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to our insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding le tters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we had $268 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 5.71%.
889900_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	We had $4.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of $227 million at that date.
889900_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	As of February 16, 2018, we had repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, had approximately $118,000 of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and had borrowing capacity of $499.9 million.
889900_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	2015 Reimbursement Agreement On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the Reimbursement Agreement ) with The Bank of Nova Scotia ( Scotiabank ), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had $54.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.
889900_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank s prevailing practice.

889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S8	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness.
889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S9	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement.
889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S10	The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole premium as specified in the note purchase agreements.
889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S11	We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control.
889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S12	In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets.
889900_18_ITEM7_P70_S13	If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.
889900_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants.
889900_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time.
889900_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.
889900_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00.
889900_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period.
889900_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, o ur ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.
889900_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Events of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events.
889900_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
889900_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	In addition, if we default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	2028 Senior Notes On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	We pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	The 2028 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S7	The 2028 Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S8	In addition, the 2028 Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 Notes.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S9	The guarantors guarantees of the 2028 Notes (the Guarantees ) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors future subordinated debt.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S10	The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S11	In the future, the Guarantees may be released and terminated under certain circumstances.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S12	We, at our option, may redeem the Notes in whole or part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium.
889900_18_ITEM7_P75_S13	Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, we, at our option, may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date.
889900_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Notes were issued includes covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.
889900_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	These covenants are subject to important qualifications and limitations set forth in the indenture.
889900_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, each holder of the 2028 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder s 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
889900_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the 2028 Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.

889900_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Commitments and Cont ingencies As of December 31, 2017, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $59.5 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the t erms of the underlying insurance contracts.
889900_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed.
889900_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to purchase approximately $172 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Our pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors.
889900_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $140 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $35.9 million were required to be purchased during 2018.
889900_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.
889900_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Trading and Investing We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts.
889900_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.
889900_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	The following table presents information with respect to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
889900_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Principal repayment of the Series A Notes is required at maturity on October 5, 2020.
889900_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Interest to be paid on the Series A Notes using 4.97% coupon rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Interest to be paid on the Series B Notes using 4.27% coupon rate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
889900_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Represents commitments to purchase major equipment to be delivered in 2018 based on expected delivery dates.
889900_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Represents commitments to purchase proppants and chemicals for our pressure pumping business.
889900_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
889900_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill).
889900_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure.
889900_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired.
889900_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss).
889900_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies.
889900_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).
889900_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management.
889900_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.
889900_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Property and equipment Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost.
889900_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
889900_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
889900_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis.
889900_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs).
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	The remaining components of these rigs will be retired.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	In 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S4	In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no impairment charge as we had written down mechanical rigs that were still marketed in 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S5	In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and nine non-APEX electric rigs that would no longer be marketed.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S6	Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that continued to be marketed but were not operating and which we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S7	In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remained marketed but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S8	We also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.
889900_18_ITEM7_P94_S9	There were no similar charges in 2017 or 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	We review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives ( triggering events ).
889900_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings.
889900_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time.
889900_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate.
889900_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management s expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future.
889900_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset s net book value.
889900_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.
889900_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Based on current commodity prices, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 a nd management s expectations of operating results in future periods, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our reporting segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our expectations of future operating results were based on the assumption that activity levels in all segments and our other operations will remain relatively stable or improve in response to relatively stable or increasing oil prices.
889900_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	We concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, with respect to our reporting segments, based on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	As a result of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we concluded a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	We performed a Step 1 analysis to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S4	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S5	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S6	Due to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to once again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S7	We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S8	With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S9	Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S10	For both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S11	Rigs not under term contracts would be subject to pricing in the spot market.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S12	Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns.
889900_18_ITEM7_P100_S13	Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S4	We determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S5	From time to time, we may perform quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S6	If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S7	In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S8	An entity will now perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S9	An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P101_S10	We adopted this update in 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Prior to adoption w e first determined whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if so, the resulting goodwill impairment was determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test.
889900_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	The first step of the quantitative testing was to compare the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units.
889900_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing was performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill.
889900_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	If this resulting fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in the amount of such shortfall.
889900_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount.
889900_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	In making this determination, we considered the curr ent and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our operating results for 2017 and 2016 and forecasted operating results for the respective succe eding year.
889900_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	Management also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	As a result of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S4	The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.

889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S6	Based on the results of the Step 1 goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S7	In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S8	In connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of the goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S9	In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S10	The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.
889900_18_ITEM7_P105_S11	The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.

889900_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Revenues from sales of products are recognized upon customer acceptance.
889900_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Revenues are presented net of any sales tax charged to the customer that we are required to remit to local or state governmental taxing authorities.
889900_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Reimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services, shipping and other services that are provided at the request of our customers are recorded as revenue when incurred.
889900_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	The related costs are recorded as operating expense when incurred.
889900_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

889900_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition Our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	Please see Risk Factors We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S3	Declines in Customers Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results in Item 1A of this Report.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S4	The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S5	Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S6	Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S7	Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S8	In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have increased, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2018 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S9	We expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S10	Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers expectations of future oil and natural gas prices.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S11	A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S12	Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S13	Impact of Inflation Inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM7_P113_S14	We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.
889900_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.
889900_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate.

889900_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The exchange rate between Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars has fluctuated during the last several years.
889900_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	If the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar weakens, revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced and the value of our Canadian net assets will decline when they are translated to U.S. dollars.
889900_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	This currency risk is not material to our results of operations or financial condition.
889900_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items.

889900_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

889900_18_ITEM9A_P2_S6	The acquired business represented approximately two percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately five percent of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017.
889900_18_ITEM9A_P2_S7	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Report and which is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Report.
