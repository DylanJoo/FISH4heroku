1267425_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the "Offering") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2011, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the "Operating Partnerships") each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the "Federal Housing Tax Credit"), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2011 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund's working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.
1267425_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below.
1267425_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.

1267425_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, there remained a $100,000 shortfall between the construction loan balance and the permanent debt commitment.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	This shortfall was funded by a loan of remaining investment partnership equity of $45,876, funds from the operating general partner and Operating Partnership of approximately $10,000, and a loan from the reserves of the investment partnership in the amount of $43,247.

1267425_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	In June 2010, the operating general partner refocused its efforts on negotiating a loan modification with the existing mortgage lender.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	By late July 2010, the operating general partner, the investment general partner and the lender had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	In August 2010 the contractor also agreed, in concept, to the proposed loan modification.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	They were released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all closing conditions were satisfied.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The operating general partner contributed $148,000 towards the loan modification and a new investor contributed $600,000.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The new investor was assigned a 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC in exchange for its $600,000 capital contribution.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	The new investor entity is related to the investment general partner.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	As a result of this transaction, approximately $249,000 per year of federal tax credits, equivalent to approximately $42 per 1,000 BACs will be allocated to the new investor.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	On a cumulative basis, tax credits allocated to the original investors in Rosewood Place, LLC will be reduced by approximately $748,000, equivalent to $125 per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S6	If the new investor had not contributed to the loan modification and the foreclosure had occurred in 2010 the investment general partner estimates that there would have been recapture and interest relating to credits previously claimed of $613,304, as well as an estimated loss of credits for the tax years 2010-2017 of $3,854,295.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P55_S7	This represents recapture of $102 and credit loss totaling $642, respectively, per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	This property is part of a portfolio that includes several properties that experienced operational difficulties in 2008 and 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	During those years the operating general partner s financial position also deteriorated, preventing his ability to recapitalize any of these properties.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Although the operating general partner s financial position did not improve during 2010, operations throughout his portfolio did stabilize and improve in 2010.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	During 2010, the investment general partner actively worked with the operating general partner and lender to restructure the mortgage debt as discussed above.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Now that the loan amendment has closed, real estate taxes, insurance escrows and bond payments are current as of March 31, 2011.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, payments to the contractor under the aforementioned five-year payment plan were also current as of March 31, 2011.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Marble Fall Vistas Apartments L.P. (Vistas Apartments) is a 124-unit family property located in Marble Falls, TX.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The property experienced an increase in vacancy in 2010 and first quarter of 2011 caused by a soft employment and rental market.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, the property is exempt from paying real estate taxes and operating expenses continue to be below the investment general partner s state averages.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	As a result, the property was able to operate above breakeven in 2010 and through the first quarter of 2011.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The local economy continues to struggle, and many employers have relocated or reduced their work force.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The operating general partner increased marketing by adding new signage and increasing the property s newspaper and on-line presence.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	To minimize turnover and boost resident retention, management continues to organize monthly social events at the property.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The operating general partner is also using tenant referral incentives to help increase occupancy.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	The mortgage and insurance payments are current.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2011 and 2010.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Partnership s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	The Partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Partnership s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships plus advances made to Operating Partnerships, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	The Partnership s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Partnership.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued accounting guidance for Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and shall be applied prospectively except for very limited transactions.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	In February 2008, the FASB delayed for one year implementation of the guidance as it pertains to certain non-financial assets and liabilities.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The Fund adopted GAAP for Fair Value Measurements effective April 1, 2008, except as it applies to those non-financial assets and liabilities, for which the effective date was April 1, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	The Fund has determined that adoption of this guidance has no material impact on the Fund s financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	In November 2008, the FASB issued accounting guidance on Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations that addresses how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined, how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed, how an equity method investee s issuance of shares should be accounted for, and how to account for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	This guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The Fund adopted the guidance for the interim quarterly period beginning April 1, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	Adoption of the guidance does not have a material impact on the Fund s financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	In April 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance for Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	This requires disclosure about the method and significant assumptions used to establish the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as annual statements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	It became effective for Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. as of and for the interim period ended June 30, 2009 and has no impact on the Fund s financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding subsequent events, which was subsequently updated in February 2010.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	This guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009, and was therefore adopted by the Fund for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S4	The adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the Fund reports, either through recognition or disclosure, in the financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S5	In February 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, alleviating conflicts with current SEC guidance.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P72_S6	This amendment was effective immediately and therefore the Company did not include the disclosure in this Form 10-K.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1267425_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Effective July 1, 2009, the Codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	The Codification is intended to reorganize, rather than change, existing GAAP.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	Accordingly, all references to currently existing GAAP have been removed and have been replaced with plain English explanations of the Fund s accounting policies.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	The adoption of the Codification did not have a material impact on the Fund s financial position or results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).
1267425_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	The amended guidance modifies the consolidation model to one based on control and economics, and replaced quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The primary beneficiary of a VIE will be the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	Further, the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around VIEs.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	This amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM7_P76_S5	The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Fund s financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Funds s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole as of March 31, 2011.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2011, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_11_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total partnership and for each of the series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2011.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the partnership s management.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1267425_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	The partnership has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P45_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1267425_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ("Offering") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P73_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the operating limited partnerships including the low-income housing tax credits and the residual value upon sale or disposition of the equity interest in the operating limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	If the investment is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the fair value of such investment.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P74_S4	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010, of $6,214,616 and $4,054,571, respectively.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the partnership s financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P82_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P82_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	As of March 31, 2011, an impairment loss of $515,429 and $791,820 for Series 48 and Series 49, respectively, was recorded.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	As of March 31, 2010, an impairment loss of $1,018,679 was recorded for Series 49.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P83_S3	As of March 31, 2011, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 6 years for all Series.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for each of the ensuing 5 years through March 31, 2016 is estimated to be $769,615 per year.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	Costs incurred in connection with borrowing funds to make capital contributions to operating limited partnerships and certain other costs are capitalized and included in investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	Such costs are being amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	As of March 31, 2011, an impairment loss of $86,385 and $31,129 for Series 47 and Series 48, respectively, was recorded to bring the capitalized expense to zero for Series 47 and Series 48.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P86_S3	As of March 31, 2010, an impairment loss of $131,314 was recorded to bring the capitalized expense to zero for Series 49.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Accumulated amortization for capitalized expenses as of March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P89_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding subsequent events, which was subsequently updated in February 2010.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	This guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S2	In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S3	This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009, and was therefore adopted by the Fund for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S4	The adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the Fund reports, either through recognition or disclosure, in the financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S5	In February 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date, through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, alleviating conflicts with current SEC guidance.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P94_S6	This amendment was effective immediately and therefore the Fund did not include the disclosure in this Form 10-K.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	The amended guidance modifies the consolidation model to one based on control and economics, and replaces the current quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The primary beneficiary of a VIE will be the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S2	Further, the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a VIE.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S3	Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around VIEs.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S4	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P96_S5	The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Fund s financial statements.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1267425_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	Effective July 1, 2009, the Codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1267425_11_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Codification is intended to reorganize, rather than change, existing GAAP.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P97_S3	Accordingly, all references to currently existing GAAP have been removed and have been replaced with plain English explanations of the Partnership s accounting policies.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	The adoption of the Codification did not have a material impact on the Partnership s financial position or results of operations.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership is entitled to an annual fund management fee based on .5% of the aggregate cost of all apartment complexes acquired by the operating limited partnerships.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	The aggregate cost is comprised of the capital contributions made by each series to the operating limited partnerships and 99% of the permanent financing at the operating limited partnership level.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P100_S2	The annual fund management fee charged to operations for the years ended for March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the operating limited partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the operating limited partnerships to the Fund.
1267425_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	The reporting fees paid by the operating limited partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1267425_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	The fund management fees paid by the Fund for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

1267425_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Fund has limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which own or are constructing operating apartment complexes.

1267425_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund ) is a limited partnership formed under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act as of October 15, 2003.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2012, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ).
1267425_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2012 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	- The uncertainty of the market.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund's working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.
1267425_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below.
1267425_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.
1267425_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as Qualified Occupancy.

1267425_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Continental L.P. (Time Square on the Hill) is a 200-unit family development located in Fort Worth, TX.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Despite occupancy that fluctuates around 90%, the property consistently operates below breakeven due to low economic occupancy and high operating expenses.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Management was able to cut the bad debt in half in 2010 due to more diligent collections efforts and tighter applicant screening policies.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Bad debt stayed consistent with 2010 levels in 2011 at 3% of rental income.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	Occupancy dropped in mid-2011 after the property experienced high turnover coupled with low traffic.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The property suffers from poor visibility and has almost no drive-by traffic, requiring a large amount of money to be spent on advertising.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The property also has fewer amenities than the competition, which includes properties that have pools, washer/dryer connections and covered parking at the same rent levels as CP Continental.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	The site staff increased its visits to nearby retailers and businesses to place fliers in an effort to increase traffic to the property and was able to increase occupancy to 92% by year end 2011, and 98% for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Management continues to review the budget to determine areas to control expenses and improve cash flow.

1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	McEver Vineyards L.P. (McEver Vineyards) is a 220-unit family property located in Gainesville, GA.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Average physical occupancy remained strong in 2011 increasing slightly to 96% from 95% in 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Note that in 2009 occupancy at McEver Vineyards had declined to 87% as a result of the recession and its impact on the Atlanta metro area.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Occupancy averaged 98% for the quarter ending March 31, 2012, and as of March 31, 2012, the property was 98% occupied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	Occupancy has steadily recovered after the closing of several area food processing plants in early 2009 which resulted in a diminished tenant base.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	However, reduced rental rates at McEver Vineyards and several competing properties have yet to return to previous levels.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	As of the last site inspection by the investment general partner in January 2012, all vacant units were rent ready and the property maintained good curb appeal.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The mortgage payable had been in default since October 2009 with two months mortgage payments in arrears.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	However, in 2011 the Operating Partnership paid the arrearage and as of March 31, 2012 the mortgage payable is current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The operating general partner has attempted to restructure the debt in order to improve cash flow; however, to date it has been unsuccessful.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	While the investment general partner will continue to work with the operating general partner and lender in an effort to improve operations, as of March 31, 2012 the lender is not interested in negotiating and documenting a loan modification.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In March 2012, the operating general partner advanced $69,000 to McEver Vineyards primarily to bring the Operating Partnership s real estate taxes current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	In March 2011, the operating general partner advanced $142,000 to McEver Vineyards; approximately $107,000 was utilized to bring the Operating Partnership s real estate taxes current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	In 2011 and for the quarter ending March 31, 2012, some elements of property operations improved as overall rental revenue increased and bad debt and real estate tax expense decreased.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, as maintenance, utilities, property insurance and turnover costs remained high, overall property operations in 2011 and for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 continued to be below a breakeven level.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Originally, the operating general partner s operating deficit guaranty was set at a maximum of $800,000 for a period of thirty-six months commencing after rental achievement.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The operating general partner had thought that rental achievement was met in the first quarter of 2007, and consequently the operating deficit guaranty was scheduled to expire in March 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	However, upon review of the definition of rental achievement in the Partnership Agreement by the investment general partner it was determined that rental achievement had in fact not been met.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	In late June 2010, the operating general partner confirmed the operating deficit guaranty was still in force and agreed to continue funding operating deficits in exchange for the Operating Partnership agreeing that these advances would be treated as a third party loan in terms of priority of repayment from cash flow and/or capital events.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Effective September 2010, the Partnership Agreement was amended to reflect these changes in the treatment of operating deficit loans.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	As of March 31, 2012, the mortgage, insurance and real estate taxes were current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	If the property is foreclosed in 2012, the estimated credit loss of $810,838 and tax credit recapture cost and interest penalty of $687,286 are equivalent to a credit loss of $233 per 1,000 BACs and a recapture and interest penalty cost of $198 per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Marble Fall Vistas Apartments L.P. (Vistas Apartments) is a 124-unit family property located in Marble Falls, TX.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The property experienced an increase in vacancy in 2011 that continued into 2012; as of March 31, 2012, the property was 89% occupied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	A soft employment and rental market caused the increase in vacancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	The local economy continues to struggle, and many employers have relocated or reduced their work force.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	However, the property is exempt from paying real estate taxes and its operating expenses continue to be below the investment general partner s state averages.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	As a result, the property was able to operate above breakeven through the first quarter of 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	The operating general partner increased marketing by adding new signage and increasing the property s newspaper and on-line presence.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	To minimize turnover and boost resident retention, management continues to organize monthly social events at the property.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	The operating general partner is also using tenant referral incentives to help increase occupancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P25_S9	The mortgage and insurance payments are current.

1267425_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The series had a total of 11 properties as of March 31, 2012, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the tax years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the series, in total, generated $980,624 and $1,501,205, respectively in passive income tax losses that were passed through to the investors and also provided $0.97 for both years in tax credits per BAC to the investors.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, Investments in Operating Partnerships for Series 48 was $6,625,699 and $8,346,895, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The decrease is primarily the result of the way the Fund accounts for such investments, the equity method.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	By using the equity method, the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, the net loss of the series was $2,110,274 and $2,621,202, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The major components of the current year amount were share of losses from operating partnerships, impairment loss, and partnership management fees.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	McEver Vineyards L.P. (McEver Vineyards) is a 220-unit family property located in Gainesville, GA.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Average physical occupancy remained strong in 2011 increasing slightly to 96% from 95% in 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Note that in 2009 occupancy at McEver Vineyards had declined to 87% as a result of the recession and its impact on the Atlanta metro area.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Occupancy averaged 98% for the quarter ending March 31, 2012, and as of March 31, 2012, the property was 98% occupied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	Occupancy has steadily recovered after the closing of several area food processing plants in early 2009 which resulted in a diminished tenant base.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	However, reduced rental rates at McEver Vineyards and several competing properties have yet to return to previous levels.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	As of the last site inspection by the investment general partner in January 2012, all vacant units were rent ready and the property maintained good curb appeal.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The mortgage payable had been in default since October 2009 with two months mortgage payments in arrears.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	However, in 2011 the Operating Partnership paid the arrearage and as of March 31, 2012 the mortgage payable is current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The operating general partner has attempted to restructure the debt in order to improve cash flow; however, to date it has been unsuccessful.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	While the investment general partner will continue to work with the operating general partner and lender in an effort to improve operations, as of March 31, 2012 the lender is not interested in negotiating and documenting a loan modification.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	In March 2012, the operating general partner advanced $69,000 to McEver Vineyards primarily to bring the Operating Partnership s real estate taxes current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	In March 2011, the operating general partner advanced $142,000 to McEver Vineyards; approximately $107,000 was utilized to bring the Operating Partnership s real estate taxes current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	In 2011 and for the quarter ending March 31, 2012, some elements of property operations improved as overall rental revenue increased and bad debt and real estate tax expense decreased.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	However, as maintenance, utilities, property insurance and turnover costs remained high, overall property operations in 2011 and for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 continued to be below a breakeven level.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Originally, the operating general partner s operating deficit guaranty was set at a maximum of $800,000 for a period of thirty-six months commencing after rental achievement.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The operating general partner had thought that rental achievement was met in the first quarter of 2007, and consequently the operating deficit guaranty was scheduled to expire in March 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	However, upon review of the definition of rental achievement in the Partnership Agreement by the investment general partner it was determined that rental achievement had in fact not been met.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	In late June 2010, the operating general partner confirmed the operating deficit guaranty was still in force and agreed to continue funding operating deficits in exchange for the Operating Partnership agreeing that these advances would be treated as a third party loan in terms of priority of repayment from cash flow and/or capital events.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	Effective September 2010, the Partnership Agreement was amended to reflect these changes in the treatment of operating deficit loans.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S5	As of March 31, 2012, the mortgage, insurance and real estate taxes were current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P34_S6	If the property is foreclosed in 2012, the estimated credit loss of $810,838 and tax credit recapture cost and interest penalty of $687,286 are equivalent to a credit loss of $353 per 1,000 BACs and a recapture and interest penalty cost of $299 per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100%.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The series had a total of 24 properties as of March 31, 2012, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	For the tax years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the series, in total, generated $1,544,181 and $2,486,518, respectively, in passive income tax losses that were passed through to the investors, and also provided $0.91 and $0.95, respectively, in tax credits per BAC to the investors.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, Investments in Operating Partnerships for Series 49 was $21,176,147 and $25,898,813, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decrease is primarily the result of the way the Fund accounts for such investments, the equity method.

1267425_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, the net loss of the series was $5,628,567 and $5,648,975, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The major components of the current year amount were share of losses from operating partnerships, partnership management fees, and impairment losses.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Post Oak East Apartments (Post Oak East L.P.) is a 240-unit family property located in Euless, Texas.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Occupancy began to decline in the fourth quarter of 2009, reaching 85% in December 2009.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	A new management company, hired in December 2009, implemented a comprehensive marketing and resident retention program in an effort to increase occupancy and find more qualified residents.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	As a result, occupancy improved to and remained at an average of 92% in 2010 and 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Occupancy for the first quarter of 2012 averaged 91%.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Prior to the construction loan converting to conventional permanent fixed-rate financing in November 2010, the property was operating above breakeven.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	However, the debt payments under the construction loan (floating rate, tax-exempt bonds) consisted of only interest payments with no principal amortization payments.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Had the loan converted to permanent financing under the floating rate for tax-exempt bonds, as originally planned, and the property maintained the then current levels of bad debt expense, unit turnover costs, and real estate taxes, operations would have been below breakeven.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	In November 2010, simultaneously with the conversion to conventional permanent financing, and with the approval of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and the investment general partner, the Operating Partnership admitted a new non-profit operating general partner that assumed 51% of the original operating general partner interest.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The remaining 49% of the original operating general partner interest was converted to a Class B limited partner interest, owned by the original operating general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Because of its non-profit status, the new operating general partner entitles the property to a full abatement of the real estate taxes, saving the property approximately $150,000 annually.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Under the terms of the permanent loan (principal of $13,600,000 and a fixed interest rate of 5.50%) and a full abatement of the real estate taxes, the property is operating above breakeven.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In an effort to facilitate the closing of the permanent financing in November 2010, the investment general partner approved the release of the remaining equity prior to the Operating Partnership upon meeting rental achievement.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	In October of 2011, the Operating Partnership was able to document rental achievement.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	The property s mortgage and insurance payments are current as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Gardens of Athens (The Gardens of Athens, LP) is a 36-unit elderly development located in Athens, Texas.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Physical occupancy averaged 99% in 2011 and 100% for the first quarter of 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Despite fairly strong operations, a shortfall of approximately $200,000 between the balance of the construction loan and the originally underwritten permanent loan principal resulted in a conversion delay.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	After several extensions to the term of the construction loan, the original permanent lender, which was also the construction lender, withdrew its commitment to provide permanent financing, and on May 6, 2008 issued a notice of default under the construction loan, due to an expiration of the loan s term.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	The lender later agreed to extend the term of the construction loan through January 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	In January 2010, the Operating Partnership closed on a new permanent loan, which is guaranteed by Rural Development under Section 538.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, there remained a $100,000 shortfall between the construction loan balance and the permanent debt commitment.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	This shortfall was funded by a loan of remaining investment partnership equity of $45,876, funds from the operating general partner and Operating Partnership of approximately $10,000, and a loan from the reserves of the investment partnership in the amount of $43,247.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	The equity loan of $45,876 from the investment partnership will convert to contributed equity upon the Operating Partnership s achievement of certain benchmarks, which are believed to have occurred in 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	Documentation of such benchmarks has been submitted by the operating general partner and is currently under review by the investment general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The loan from the investment partnership s reserves has been paid back in full.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	The property operated above breakeven in 2010 and 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Operations were slightly below breakeven in the first quarter of 2012, due to some property-wide roof repairs; however, the Operating Partnership has submitted a request for reimbursement from the replacement reserve, which if approved, should bring operations above breakeven again.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	A rent increase of $25/unit per month took effect with lease renewals, beginning on May 1, 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	The property s mortgage, real estate tax and insurance payments are current as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Rosewood Senior Apartments (Rosewood Place, LLC) is a 144-unit senior's development in Lenexa, Kansas.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	The property reached initial full qualified occupancy in November 2007.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	The average occupancy for 2009, 2010 and 2011 was 91%, 95% and 99%, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	As of March 31, 2012, the property was 99% occupied and reported average occupancy of 98% for the first quarter of 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	Operations were nominally below breakeven in 2009, and at breakeven during 2010 and 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S5	The Operating Partnership was able to stay current on its first mortgage debt during the time period 2007 2010 because no real estate tax payments were made for tax years 2006 through 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P48_S6	All outstanding taxes were paid (including interest and penalties) on January 7, 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	At December 31, 2010, an estimated $605,700 in real estate taxes and interest penalties were owed by Rosewood Place, LLC, including the first and second half 2010 real estate taxes.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	As previously noted, the full tax amount owed was paid on January 7, 2011 from capital raised as part of the loan amendment described below that closed into escrow on December 21, 2010 and was released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all conditions for closing the amendment were satisfied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In July 2009, a contractor filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting foreclosure of its mechanic s lien.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	This motion was approved on February 17, 2010, and an advertised foreclosure sale on April 14, 2010 was scheduled.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	On April 12, 2010, the contractor agreed to postpone the sale and to continue to negotiate a payment plan with the operating general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	In June 2010, the operating general partner and the contractor reached an oral agreement on a five-year payment plan to settle the mechanic s lien claim for $250,000.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	The mechanic s lien judgment was released on December 29, 2010 as part of the settlement agreement executed in December 2010 by the contractor and the operating general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	In June 2010, the operating general partner refocused its efforts on negotiating a loan modification with the existing mortgage lender.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	By late July 2010, the operating general partner, the investment general partner and the lender had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	In August 2010 the contractor also agreed, in concept, to the proposed loan modification.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	The modification documents were executed and the transaction closed into escrow on December 21, 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	They were released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all closing conditions were satisfied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	The operating general partner contributed $148,000 towards the loan modification and a new investor contributed $600,000.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S6	The new investor was assigned a 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC in exchange for its $600,000 capital contribution.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S7	The new investor entity is related to the investment general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S8	As a result of this transaction, approximately $249,000 per year of federal tax credits, equivalent to approximately $42 per 1,000 BACs, will be allocated to the new investor.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P51_S9	It is anticipated that the new investor will put its 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC back to the investment limited partner in early 2015.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	On a cumulative basis, the investment general partner originally forecasted that the tax credits allocated to the original investors in Rosewood Place, LLC would be reduced by approximately $748,000 (equivalent to $125 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, it is now projected that the amount of tax credit reduction for the original investors will be approximately $997,000 (equivalent to $167 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	If the new investor had not contributed to the loan modification and the foreclosure had occurred in 2010, the investment general partner estimates that there would have been recapture and interest relating to credits previously claimed of $613,304, as well as an estimated loss of credits for the tax years 2010-2017 of $3,854,295.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	This represents recapture of $102 and credit loss totaling $642, respectively, per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	This property is part of a portfolio that includes several properties that experienced operational difficulties in 2008 and 2009.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	During those years the operating general partner s financial position also deteriorated, preventing his ability to recapitalize any of these properties.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Although the operating general partner s financial position did not improve during 2010, operations throughout his portfolio did stabilize and improve in 2010.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	During 2010, the investment general partner actively worked with the operating general partner and lender to restructure the mortgage debt as discussed above.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Since the loan amendment for Rosewood Place, LLC closed in January 2011, real estate taxes, insurance escrows and bond payments have been paid currently and remain current as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	In addition, payments to the contractor under the aforementioned five-year payment plan were also current as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Marble Fall Vistas Apartments L.P. (Vistas Apartments) is a 124-unit family property located in Marble Falls, TX.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The property experienced an increase in vacancy in 2011 that continued into 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of March 31, 2012, the property was 89% occupied.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	A soft employment and rental market caused the increase in vacancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	The local economy continues to struggle, and many employers have relocated or reduced their work force.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	However, the property is exempt from paying real estate taxes and its operating expenses continue to be below the investment general partner s state averages.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	As a result, the property was able to operate above breakeven through the first quarter of 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S7	The operating general partner increased marketing by adding new signage and increasing the property s newspaper and on-line presence.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S8	To minimize turnover and boost resident retention, management continues to organize monthly social events at the property.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S9	The operating general partner is also using tenant referral incentives to help increase occupancy.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P55_S10	The mortgage and insurance payments are current.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2012 and 2011.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Partnership s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	The Partnership s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships plus advances made to Operating Partnerships, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	The Partnership s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Partnership.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).
1267425_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The amended guidance modifies the consolidation model to one based on control and economics, and replaced quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	The primary beneficiary of a VIE will be the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Further, the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around VIEs.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	This amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1267425_12_ITEM7_P66_S5	The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Fund s financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2012, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_12_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total partnership and for each of the series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the partnership s management.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1267425_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	The partnership has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P45_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P45_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1267425_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P69_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the operating limited partnerships including the low-income housing tax credits and the residual value upon sale or disposition of the equity interest in the operating limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	If the investment is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the fair value of such investment.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P70_S3	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P70_S4	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, of $6,999,722 and $6,214,616, respectively.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the partnership s financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P78_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P78_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	As of March 31, 2012, an impairment loss of $153,715 for Series 49 was recorded.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	As of March 31, 2011, an impairment loss of $515,429 and $791,820 for Series 48 and Series 49, respectively, was recorded.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	As of March 31, 2012, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 5 years for all Series.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for each of the ensuing 5 years through March 31, 2017 is estimated to be $738,872 per year.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Costs incurred in connection with borrowing funds to make capital contributions to operating limited partnerships and certain other costs are capitalized and included in investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	Such costs are being amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Accumulated amortization for capitalized expenses as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	In June 2009, the the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The amended guidance modifies the consolidation model to one based on control and economics, and replaces the current quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The primary beneficiary of a VIE will be the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Further, the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a VIE.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around VIEs.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P91_S5	The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Fund s financial statements.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, are as follows:
1267425_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, total fund management fees accrued were $3,470,297 and $2,582,469, respectively.

1267425_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	At times, the balances may exceed these insurance limits; however, the Fund has not experienced any losses with respect to it balances in excess of FDIC insurance.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P114_S3	Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to these cash and cash equivalent balances exists as of March 31, 2012.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Fund s financial instruments relate to other assets, notes receivable, and accounts payable - affiliates.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	Management has not disclosed the fair value of these financial instruments because determination of such fair value is deemed to be impractical.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P115_S2	The other assets, notes receivable, and accounts payable - affiliates are due from or owed to affiliates of the Fund.
1267425_12_ITEM15_P115_S3	The unique nature of these financial instruments makes determination of any fair value impractical.

1267425_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund ) is a limited partnership formed under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act as of October 15, 2003.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2013, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ).
1267425_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2013 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	- The uncertainty of the market.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund's working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.
1267425_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below.
1267425_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.
1267425_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as Qualified Occupancy.
1267425_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Operating Partnerships and the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus.
1267425_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The general partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.

1267425_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Fund is classified as a limited partnership and does not have common stock.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	There is no established public trading market for the BACs and it is not anticipated that any public market will develop.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the Fund has 5,139 BAC holders for an aggregate of 11,777,706 BACs, at a subscription price of $10 per BAC, received and accepted.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The BACs were issued in series.

1267425_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Fund has made no distributions of net cash flow to its BAC holders from its inception, October 15, 2003, through March 31, 2013.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Fund Agreement provides that profits, losses and credits will be allocated each month to the holder of record of a BAC as of the last day of such month.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	Allocation of profits, losses and credits among BAC holders are made in proportion to the number of BACs held by each BAC Holder.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	Any distributions of net cash flow or liquidation, sale or refinancing proceeds will be made within 180 days of the end of the annual period to which they relate.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	Distributions will be made to the holders of record of a BAC as of the last day of each month in the ratio which (i) the BACs held by the holder on the last day of the calendar month bears to (ii) the aggregate number of BACs outstanding on the last day of such month.
1267425_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	To date the Fund has not made any cash distributions to the limited partners.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Despite occupancy that fluctuates around 90%, the property consistently operates below breakeven due to low occupancy and high operating expenses.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Management was able to reduce bad debt to around 3% in 2011, and it has been further reduced in 2012 to less than 2% of rental income.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	Although the cash flow loss was reduced in 2012, low rents and high expenses caused the property to continue to operate below breakeven.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The property suffers from poor visibility and has almost no drive-by traffic, requiring a large amount of money to be spent on advertising.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The property also has fewer amenities than the competition, which includes properties that have pools, washer/dryer connections and covered parking at the same rent levels as CP Continental.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	The site staff has increased its visits to nearby retailers and businesses to place fliers in an effort to increase traffic to the property.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Beginning in 2009, weak and declining economic conditions caused several major employers to close, resulting in a number of move-outs and evictions for non-payment of rent.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Consequently, the average annual occupancy declined to 87% in 2009 after averaging in the mid-90s% during 2006 - 2008.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	Despite this high occupancy level, operations remained below breakeven through the first quarter of 2013 due to low rent levels, continued high operating expenses, deferred maintenance costs and burdensome debt service.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The operating general partner has attempted to restructure the debt in order to improve cash flow; to date this has been unsuccessful.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	While the investment general partner intends to continue to work with the operating general partner and lender to improve operations, as of March 31, 2013 the lender continues to not be interested in negotiating and documenting a loan modification.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	In addition, the increased turnover from skips and evictions for non-payment of rent caused operations to decline to below breakeven.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	According to management, the tenant base is primarily composed of employees of a large outlet mall located two blocks from the property.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Beginning in early 2012, the outlet mall closed approximately thirty stores, which negatively affected the property.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The additional turnover resulted in increased administrative and maintenance costs associated with re-leasing and making vacant units rent-ready.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	To reduce vacancy, management has increased its community outreach efforts to include local churches, social agencies, and the housing authority.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Rosewood Senior Apartments (Rosewood Place, LLC) is a 144-unit senior's development in Lenexa, Kansas.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The property reached initial full qualified occupancy in November 2007.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	The average occupancy in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was 95%, 99% and 98%, respectively.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	In the first quarter of 2013, the average occupancy was over 95%.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Management attributed the small first quarter decline in occupancy to the opening of a new 48-unit senior's Low Income Housing Tax Credit apartment community in March 2013 approximately 7 miles from Rosewood Place.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	Although this new property reportedly is nearly fully leased, the operating general partner is concerned that it will put downward pressure on rents at Rosewood Place since its asking rents are approximately $100/month less than those at Rosewood Place when tenant utility costs are factored in.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	Note that income limits and therefore rent levels for the new property were set for households earning 40% and 50% of the area median income.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S7	The operating general partner and the investment general partner will closely monitor Rosewood s occupancy over the next several quarters to determine whether any concessions on rental rates are needed to sustain Rosewood Place s occupancy in the mid90s% level.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S8	Operations at Rosewood Place were nominally below breakeven in 2009, and at breakeven during 2010, 2011, 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S9	The Operating Partnership was able to stay current on its first mortgage debt during the time period 2007 2010 because no real estate tax payments were made for tax years 2006 through 2010.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P43_S10	All outstanding taxes were paid including interest and penalties on January 7, 2011.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	At December 31, 2010, an estimated $605,700 in real estate taxes and interest penalties were owed by Rosewood Place, LLC, including the first and second half 2010 real estate taxes.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	As previously noted, the full tax amount owed was paid on January 7, 2011 from capital raised as part of the loan amendment described below that closed into escrow on December 21, 2010 and was released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all conditions for closing the amendment were satisfied.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	In July 2009, a contractor filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting foreclosure of its mechanic s lien.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	This motion was approved on February 17, 2010, and an advertised foreclosure sale on April 14, 2010 was scheduled.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	On April 12, 2010, the contractor agreed to postpone the sale and to continue to negotiate a payment plan with the operating general partner.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	In June 2010, the operating general partner and the contractor reached an oral agreement on a five-year payment plan to settle the mechanic s lien claim for $250,000.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	The mechanic s lien judgment was released on December 29, 2010 as part of the settlement agreement executed in December 2010 by the contractor and the operating general partner.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	In June 2010, the operating general partner refocused its efforts on negotiating a loan modification with the existing mortgage lender.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	By late July 2010, the operating general partner, the investment general partner and the lender had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	In August 2010 the contractor also agreed, in concept, to the proposed loan modification.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	The modification documents were executed and the transaction closed into escrow on December 21, 2010.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	They were released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all closing conditions were satisfied.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S5	The operating general partner contributed $148,000 towards the loan modification and a new investor contributed $600,000.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S6	The new investor was assigned a 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC in exchange for its $600,000 capital contribution.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S7	The new investor entity is related to the investment general partner.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S8	As a result of this transaction, approximately $249,000 per year of federal tax credits, equivalent to approximately $42 per 1,000 BACs, will be allocated to the new investor.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P46_S9	It is anticipated that the new investor will put its 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC back to the investment limited partner in early 2015.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	On a cumulative basis, the investment general partner originally forecasted that the tax credits allocated to the original investors in Rosewood Place, LLC would be reduced by approximately $748,000 (equivalent to $125 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, it is now projected that the amount of tax credit reduction for the original investors will be approximately $997,000 (equivalent to $167 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	If the new investor had not contributed to the loan modification and the foreclosure had occurred in 2010, the investment general partner estimates that there would have been recapture and interest penalties relating to credits previously claimed of $613,304, as well as an estimated loss of credits for the tax years 2010-2017 of $3,854,295.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	This represents recapture of $102 and credit loss totaling $642, respectively, per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	This property is part of a portfolio that includes several properties that experienced operational difficulties in 2008 and 2009.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	During those years the operating general partner s financial position also deteriorated, preventing his ability to recapitalize any of these properties.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Although the operating general partner s financial position did not improve during 2010, 2011, and 2012, operations throughout his portfolio did stabilize.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	During 2010, the investment general partner actively worked with the operating general partner and lender to restructure the mortgage debt as discussed above.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Since the loan amendment for Rosewood Place, LLC closed in January 2011, real estate taxes, insurance escrows and bond payments have been paid currently and remained current as of March 31, 2013.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Rural Housing Partners of Kewaunee L.P. (Sunset Manor) is a 38-unit property located in Kewaunee, WI.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Occupancy has historically been an issue at this property, mainly due to evictions for nonpayment of rent and residents vacating because of job losses.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Current marketing includes advertising on Rent.com and Craigslist, advertising in the Local Free Shopper which covers three cities/towns, posting fliers in the local community, and frequent contacts with local housing agencies, as well as For Rent signs located on the property.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Occupancy averaged 88% in 2012 and the property operated below breakeven.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	In 2013, occupancy remained a concern as the property was 84% occupied as of March 31, 2013, and the property operated below breakeven through the first quarter of 2013.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	All real estate taxes, mortgage and insurance payments are current.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	On December 31, 2019, the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period will expire with respect to Sunset Manor Apartments.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	As of March 31, 2013, occupancy was 82% and the property was operating slightly below breakeven.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The struggle with vacancy is a direct reflection of economic conditions in Mauston, where ongoing job losses have led to increased evictions and migration from the area.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Management continues to focus marketing efforts on internet advertising.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	They also perform outreach to the local Housing and Urban Development office, the Wisconsin Housing Authority, and the Juneau County housing agencies.

1267425_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	On December 31, 2019, the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period will expire with respect to Brookview Apartments.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Union Square Housing Partnership, A LA L.P. (Union Square Apartments) is a 32-unit family property in Junction City, Louisiana.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Despite averaging 97% occupancy in 2012, the property operated below breakeven due to high operating expenses.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The property s insurance expense increased substantially in 2012.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The operating general partner stated that the insurance cost increase was portfolio-wide due to the number of claims filed in 2011.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	Management is now focused on educating the maintenance staff on preventative measures and decreasing rates by reducing the number of filed claims.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	Administrative costs grew over prior year amounts due to legal costs associated with an increased number of evictions for non-payment of rent, as well as a general increase in supply costs.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S6	The 2012 operating deficit was funded by utilizing operating cash and accruing payables.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S7	Although occupancy remained stable throughout the first quarter of 2013, averaging 97%, operations remained below breakeven due to continued high operating expenses.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S8	The investment general partner intends to continue to work with the operating general partner to reduce operating expenses.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S9	All real estate taxes, insurance, and mortgage payments are current.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P53_S10	The low income tax credit compliance period expires on December 31, 2019.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2013 and 2012.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an update to existing guidance related to fair value measurements on how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	For fair value measurements categorized as level 3, a reporting entity should disclose quantitative information of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, a description of the valuation processes and narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1267425_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	The adoption of this update did not materially affect the Fund's condensed financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, as of March 31, 2013.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2013, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Schedules not listed are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49 (the Partnership), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2013, and the related statements of operations, partners capital (deficit) and cash flow for the total Partnership and for each series for the year ended March 31, 2013.

1267425_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P42_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	We believe that our audit of the financial statements provides a reasonable basis for our opinion .
1267425_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.

1267425_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the partnership s management.

1267425_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1267425_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The partnership has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series as of March 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total partnership and for each series for year ended March 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1267425_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $60,000 and $0 as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P58_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, of $7,131,903 and $6,999,722, respectively.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P64_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P66_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	An impairment loss has been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 of $209,097 and $153,715, respectively, for Series 49.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	As of March 31, 2013, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 4 years for all Series.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows:
1267425_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for each of the ensuing 4 years through March 31, 2017 are estimated to be $686,597, $686,597, $686,597 and $686,601 per year, for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P71_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2009 remain open.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1267425_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an update to existing guidance related to fair value measurements on how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	For fair value measurements categorized as level 3, a reporting entity should disclose quantitative information of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, a description of the valuation processes and narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	The adoption of this update did not materially affect the Fund's condensed financial statements.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, are as follows:
1267425_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, total fund management fees accrued were $3,833,125 and $3,470,297, respectively.
1267425_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The fund management fees paid by the Fund for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

1267425_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund ) is a limited partnership formed under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act as of October 15, 2003.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2014, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2014 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	- The uncertainty of the market.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund's working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as Qualified Occupancy.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Operating Partnerships and the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The general partner believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
1267425_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a more detailed discussion of operational difficulties experienced by certain of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM4_P0_S0	The Fund is classified as a limited partnership and does not have common stock.
1267425_14_ITEM4_P1_S0	There is no established public trading market for the BACs and it is not anticipated that any public market will develop.
1267425_14_ITEM4_P2_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Fund has 5,155 BAC holders for an aggregate of 11,777,706 BACs, at a subscription price of $10 per BAC, received and accepted.
1267425_14_ITEM4_P3_S0	The BACs were issued in series.

1267425_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	By using the equity method, the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the net loss of the series was $5,658,953 and $5,720,078, respectively.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The major components of the current year amount were share of losses from operating partnerships, partnership management fees, and impairment losses.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Rosewood Senior Apartments (Rosewood Place, LLC) is a 144-unit apartment development for seniors located in Lenexa, Kansas.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The average occupancy from 2010-2013 was 96%; however, in 2013 the property experienced an increase in vacancies due a rent increase, perceived reduction in federal benefits for seniors, and deliberate tenant relocations by management due to the declining health of certain tenants and their inability to live independently.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Management worked with the families of some of the tenants by pointing out the need for more of an assisted living situation.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Through the first quarter of 2014, the property continued to experience the negative effects of tenant relocations due to health issues, as evidenced by the reported average occupancy rate of 92%.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	Management is currently marketing the property to younger seniors.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	As of early April 2014, five of the eleven vacant units had been leased to tenants with an average age of sixty.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Starting in the third quarter of 2013, management had implemented a more targeted approach to tenant retention by seeking the involvement of current tenants through suggestions and referrals.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	A referral program for existing tenants was implemented in which $100 is paid to any existing Rosewood resident whose referral leads to a lease with a new tenant.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Management views the recent decline in occupancy as an opportunity to sign younger and healthier tenants which should reduce the risk of losing occupancy for health related reasons for the next several years.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	The average age of new tenants in 2013 was 60, well below the property s average tenant age of 77.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	In addition, management has completed several capital improvement projects such as: new carpeting in the lobby and elevators, upgraded aviary, sealing the parking lot, and adding more flowers to the landscaping.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	These improvements earned positive feedback from tenants, which is an encouraging sign for tenant retention efforts.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	The goal of the operating general partner is to re-establish occupancy above 95% in the first half of 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Operations at Rosewood Place were nominally above breakeven through the first quarter of 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Operating Partnership was able to stay current on its first mortgage debt during the time period 2007 2010 because no real estate tax payments were made for tax years 2006 through 2010.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	All outstanding taxes were paid including interest and penalties on January 7, 2011.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	At December 31, 2010, an estimated $605,700 in real estate taxes and interest penalties were owed by Rosewood Place, LLC, including the first and second half 2010 real estate taxes.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	As previously noted, the full tax amount owed was paid on January 7, 2011 from capital raised as part of the loan amendment described below that closed into escrow on December 21, 2010 and was released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all conditions for closing the amendment were satisfied.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	In July 2009, a contractor filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting foreclosure of its mechanic s lien.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	This motion was approved on February 17, 2010, and an advertised foreclosure sale on April 14, 2010 was scheduled.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	On April 12, 2010, the contractor agreed to postpone the sale and to continue to negotiate a payment plan with the operating general partner.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	In June 2010, the operating general partner and the contractor reached an oral agreement on a five-year payment plan to settle the mechanic s lien claim for $250,000.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The mechanic s lien judgment was released on December 29, 2010 as part of the settlement agreement executed in December 2010 by the contractor and the operating general partner.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	In June 2010, the operating general partner refocused its efforts on negotiating a loan modification with the existing mortgage lender.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	By late July 2010, the operating general partner, the investment general partner and the lender had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	In August 2010 the contractor also agreed, in concept, to the proposed loan modification.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The modification documents were executed and the transaction closed into escrow on December 21, 2010.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	They were released from escrow on January 6, 2011 when all closing conditions were satisfied.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	The operating general partner contributed $148,000 towards the loan modification and a new investor contributed $600,000.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	The new investor was assigned a 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC in exchange for its $600,000 capital contribution.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	The new investor entity is related to the investment general partner.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S8	As a result of this transaction, approximately $249,000 per year of federal tax credits, equivalent to approximately $42 per 1,000 BACs, will be allocated to the new investor.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P45_S9	It is anticipated that the new investor will put its 45% interest in Rosewood Place, LLC back to the investment limited partner in early 2015.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	On a cumulative basis, the investment general partner originally forecasted that the tax credits allocated to the original investors in Rosewood Place, LLC would be reduced by approximately $748,000 (equivalent to $125 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, it is now projected that the amount of tax credit reduction for the original investors will be approximately $997,000 (equivalent to $167 per 1,000 BACs).
1267425_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	If the new investor had not contributed to the loan modification and the foreclosure had occurred in 2010, the investment general partner estimates that there would have been a recapture and interest penalties relating to credits previously claimed of $613,304, as well as an estimated loss of credits for the tax years 2010-2017 of $3,854,295.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	This represents recapture of $102 and credit loss totaling $642, respectively, per 1,000 BACs.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	This property is part of a portfolio that includes several properties that experienced operational difficulties in 2008 and 2009.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	During those years the operating general partner s financial position also deteriorated, preventing his ability to recapitalize any of these properties.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Although the operating general partner s financial position did not improve during 2010, 2011, and 2012, operations throughout his portfolio did stabilize.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	During 2010, the investment general partner actively worked with the operating general partner and lender to restructure the mortgage debt as discussed above.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Since the loan amendment for Rosewood Place, LLC closed in January 2011, real estate taxes, insurance escrows and bond payments have been paid currently and remained current as of March 31, 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition, payments to the contractor under the aforementioned five-year payment plan were current through August 31, 2013; however, the September, October and November 2013 payments to the contractor were deferred, as permitted under the terms of the restructuring agreement, as a result of the previously discussed decline in property operations.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	Regularly scheduled payments to the contractor re-started in December 2013 and continued through February 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	The outstanding balance owed to the contractor is $104,555.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Rural Housing Partners of Kewaunee L.P. (Sunset Manor) is a 38-unit property located in Kewaunee, WI.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Occupancy has historically been an issue at the property, mainly due to evictions for nonpayment of rent and residents vacating because of job losses.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Current marketing includes advertising on Rent.com and Craigslist, advertising in the Local Free Shopper which covers three cities/towns, posting fliers in the local community, and frequent contacts with local housing agencies, as well as For Rent signs located on the property.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	As a result of management s marketing efforts the property was 92% occupied as of March 31, 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	However, operating expenses have increased and the property operated below breakeven in the first quarter of 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	The majority of the expense increase was caused by snow removal costs and the timing of the real estate tax payment.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S6	These expenses will normalize as the year progresses.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S7	All real estate taxes, mortgage, and insurance payments are current.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P49_S8	On December 31, 2019, the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period will expire with respect to Rural Housing Partners of Kewaunee L.P.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Rural Housing Partners of Mauston L.P. (Brookview I II Apartments) is a 22-unit family property located in Mauston, WI.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	As of March 31, 2014, occupancy was 86% and the property was operating below breakeven.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The struggle with vacancy is a direct reflection of economic conditions in Mauston, where ongoing job losses have led to increased evictions and migration from the area.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Management continues to focus marketing efforts on internet advertising.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	They also perform outreach to the local Housing and Urban Development office, the Wisconsin Housing Authority, and the Juneau County housing agencies.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S5	In spite of these efforts, average occupancy decreased from 94% in 2012 to 81% in 2013.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S6	The decreased occupancy resulted in below breakeven operations in 2013 as well as the first quarter of 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S7	Though expenses increased from 2012 to 2013, they remain reasonable even with the increased advertising.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S8	All real estate taxes, mortgage, and insurance payments are current.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P50_S9	On December 31, 2019, the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period will expire with respect to Brookview Apartments.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Kaufman Fountainhead LP (Briarwood Apartments) is a 48-unit family property in Kaufman, Texas.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The property, located 45 miles southeast of Dallas, Texas, receives USDA/RD rental assistance for 21 units.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The property continued to operate below breakeven in 2013 due to high operating expenses and low occupancy.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	The 2013 average occupancy improved to 83%; however, property operations remain below breakeven.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Occupancy as of March 31, 2014 was 85%.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	The operating general partner indicated a number of recent move-outs were families relocating for employment opportunities out of the area; also, a number of applicants that would otherwise move into the property and commute to Dallas for work are moving closer to the city due to rising commuting costs.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S6	Management is allowing new move-ins to pay their security deposits over a four month period.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S7	The operating general partner believes occupancy will continue to improve without the use of move-in concessions.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S8	Management attributed the higher maintenance in 2013 to interior and exterior foundation repairs and unit turnover costs; capital expenditures for the year totaled $38,050.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S9	The operating general partner continues to fund deficits by accruing management fees and with cash advances as needed.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S10	Real estate taxes, insurance, and mortgage payments are current.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P51_S11	The low income housing tax credit compliance period expires on December 31, 2021.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Union Square Housing Partnership (Union Square Apartments) is a 32-unit family property in Junction City, LA.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Through the first quarter of 2014, property operations were below breakeven due to increased operating expenses.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Maintenance expenses have increased because of repairs to washers, dryers, and a sewer lift station.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	Occupancy has been strong as the property was fully occupied as of March 31, 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	Management has stated that the local economy is struggling and job opportunities in the area are limited, thereby limiting the ability to raise rents.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P52_S5	Marketing efforts include the distribution of fliers to local businesses and advertising in area newspapers.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The operating general partner has stated that any deficits would be funded by deferring the management fee due the related party management company and, if necessary, they would advance funds to the operating partnership.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	All mortgage, tax, and insurance payments are current.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	On December 31, 2019, the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period will expire with respect to Union Square Housing Partnership.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2014 and 2013.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, as of March 31, 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2014, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Schedules not listed are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49 (the Partnership ), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of operations, partners' capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2014.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	The Partnership's management is responsible for these financial statements.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1267425_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P42_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P42_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P48_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
1267425_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $60,000 as of March 31, 2014 and 2013.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P52_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, of $8,356,538 and $7,131,903, respectively.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P58_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P60_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Impairment losses has been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2014 of $229,911 for Series 47 and $88,947 for Series 49.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	An impairment loss has been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2013 of $209,097 for Series 49.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P61_S3	As of March 31, 2014, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 3 years for all Series.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:
1267425_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for each of the ensuing 3 years through March 31, 2017 are estimated to be $580,313, $580,313 and $580,312 per year, for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P65_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P65_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2010 remain open.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
1267425_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, are as follows:
1267425_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, total fund management fees accrued were $4,770,953 and $3,833,125, respectively.

1267425_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Fund maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances in several accounts in various financial institutions.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The balances are generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits by each institution.
1267425_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	At times, the balances may exceed these insurance limits; however, the Fund has not experienced any losses with respect to it balances in excess of FDIC insurance.

1267425_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	The unique nature of these financial instruments makes determination of any fair value impractical.

1267425_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund ) is a limited partnership formed under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act as of October 15, 2003.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2015, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2015 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.

1267425_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2015 and 2014.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Fund is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, as of March 31, 2015.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2015, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_15_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the Fund and in the capacities and on the dates indicated:

1267425_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), Boston Capital Partners II Corp.; Sr. Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) BCTC V Assignor Corp.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Schedules not listed are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49 (the Partnership ), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, partners' capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2015.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Partnership's management is responsible for these financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( United States ).
1267425_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P44_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $120,000 and $60,000, respectively, as of March 31, 2015 and 2014.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P54_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, of $8,190,511 and $8,356,538, respectively.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P60_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Fund is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2015 of $418,353 for Series 47, $168,065 for Series 48 and $33,896 for Series 49.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P65_S2	Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2014 of $229,911 for Series 47 and $88,947 for Series 49.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P65_S3	As of March 31, 2015, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 2 years for all Series.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for each of the ensuing 2 years through March 31, 2017 are estimated to be $270,157 and $270,156 per year, for 2016 and 2017, respectively.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2011 remain open.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, total fund management fees accrued were $5,783,781 and $4,770,953, respectively.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The fund management fees paid by the Fund for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	General and administrative expenses and professional fees incurred by Boston Capital Partners, Inc., Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership for each series for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, charged to each series operations are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	At March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Fund has limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which own or are constructing operating apartment complexes.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	The number of operating limited partnerships in which the Fund has limited partnership interests at March 31, 2015 and 2014 by series are as follows:
1267425_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	Under the terms of the Fund s investment in each operating limited partnership, the Fund is required to make capital contributions to the operating limited partnerships.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	These contributions are payable in installments over several years upon each operating limited partnership achieving specified levels of construction and/or operations.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	At March 31, 2015 and 2014, contributions are payable to operating limited partnerships as follows:

1267425_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Fund maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances in several accounts in various financial institutions.
1267425_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	The balances are generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits by each institution.

1267425_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund ) is a limited partnership formed under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act as of October 15, 2003.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Additional members of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2016, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund s principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2016 the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund s investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	- The uncertainty of the market.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund s working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.
1267425_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Fund has acquired a limited partnership interest in 50 Operating Partnerships in three series, identified in the table set forth below.
1267425_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships are eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.
1267425_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which initially complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a designated percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as Qualified Occupancy.
1267425_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Operating Partnerships and the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus.

1267425_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Fund is classified as a limited partnership and does not have common stock.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	There is no established public trading market for the BACs and it is not anticipated that any public market will develop.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 31, 2016, the Fund has 5,177 BAC holders for an aggregate of 11,776,706 BACs, at a subscription price of $10 per BAC, received and accepted.

1267425_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Fund has made no distributions of net cash flow to its BAC holders from its inception, October 15, 2003, through March 31, 2016.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Fund Agreement provides that profits, losses and credits will be allocated each month to the holder of record of a BAC as of the last day of such month.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	Allocation of profits, losses and credits among BAC holders are made in proportion to the number of BACs held by each BAC Holder.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	Any distributions of net cash flow or liquidation, sale or refinancing proceeds will be made within 180 days of the end of the annual period to which they relate.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	Distributions will be made to the holders of record of a BAC as of the last day of each month in the ratio which (i) the BACs held by the holder on the last day of the calendar month bears to (ii) the aggregate number of BACs outstanding on the last day of such month.
1267425_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	To date the Fund has not made any cash distributions to the limited partners.

1267425_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.

1267425_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2016 and 2015.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.
1267425_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, as of March 31, 2016.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, the Fund s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March 31, 2016, its internal control over financial reporting with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole was effective.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	On May 14, 2013, COSO issued an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework (the 2013 Framework ).
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	As of March 31, 2016, the Fund is in the process of transitioning to the 2013 Framework and expects to complete the implementation of the 2013 Framework during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.
1267425_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_16_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_16_ITEM14_P44_S0	Schedules not listed are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P45_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49 (the Partnership ), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, partners' capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2016.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P45_S1	The Partnership's management is responsible for these financial statements.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P45_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P46_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( United States ).
1267425_16_ITEM14_P46_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P46_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P46_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P46_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P47_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P47_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P48_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V Limited Partnership - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P49_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P49_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P50_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_16_ITEM14_P51_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P52_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P52_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P53_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
1267425_16_ITEM14_P54_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P54_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P54_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P55_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P55_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $120,000 as of March 31, 2016 and 2015.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P56_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P56_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P56_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P56_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, of $6,348,580 and $8,190,511, respectively.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P57_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P58_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P58_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P59_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P59_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P60_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P60_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P61_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P61_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P61_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P62_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P62_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P62_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P62_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P63_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P64_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P64_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P64_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P64_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P64_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P65_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_16_ITEM14_P65_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P65_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P66_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P66_S1	The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P67_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P67_S1	Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016 of $47,842 for Series 47, $54,923 for Series 48 and $46,810 for Series 49.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P67_S2	Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2015 of $418,353 for Series 47, $168,065 for Series 48 and $33,896 for Series 49.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P67_S3	As of March 31, 2016, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 1 year for Series 49.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P67_S4	The amortization of deferred acquisition for the year ended March 31, 2017 is estimated to be $120,582 for Series 49.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P68_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:
1267425_16_ITEM14_P69_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P69_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P70_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P70_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P70_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P70_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P71_S0	Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P71_S1	While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2012 remain open.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P72_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P72_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P73_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P73_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P74_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P74_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
1267425_16_ITEM14_P75_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P75_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P76_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc. (BCP), Boston Capital Services, Inc. (BCS), Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership (BCHLP) and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership (BCAM), as follows:
1267425_16_ITEM14_P77_S0	The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P77_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, are as follows:
1267425_16_ITEM14_P78_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P78_S1	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, total fund management fees accrued were $6,921,609 and $5,783,781, respectively.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P79_S0	The fund management fees paid by the Fund for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

1267425_16_ITEM14_P96_S0	The Fund maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances in several accounts in various financial institutions.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P96_S1	The balances are generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits by each institution.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P96_S2	At times, the balances may exceed these insurance limits; however, the Fund has not experienced any losses with respect to it balances in excess of FDIC insurance.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P96_S3	Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to these cash and cash equivalent balances exists as of March 31, 2016.

1267425_16_ITEM14_P98_S1	Management has not disclosed the fair value of these financial instruments because determination of such fair value is deemed to be impractical.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P98_S2	The other assets and accounts payable - affiliates are due from or owed to affiliates of the Fund.
1267425_16_ITEM14_P98_S3	The unique nature of these financial instruments makes determination of any fair value impractical.

1267425_16_ITEM14_P131_S1	When recovery is reviewed, if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the property are less than its carrying amount, management compares the carrying amount of the property to its fair value in order to determine whether an impairment loss has occurred.

1267425_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No trading market for the BACs exists or is expected to develop.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There is currently no active trading market for the BACs.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, limited partners may be unable to sell their BACs or may have to sell BACs at a discount.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Limited partners should consider their BACs to be a long-term investment.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investors may realize taxable gain on sale or disposition of BACs.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For this tax liability, the investor will have to pay federal income tax without a corresponding cash distribution.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The price at which an apartment complex is sold may not be large enough to pay the mortgage and other expenses which must be paid at such time.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	- The uncertainty of the market.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Any sale may occur well after the fifteen-year federal housing tax credit compliance period.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have insufficient sources of cash to pay our existing liabilities.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We currently do not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our financial liabilities.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have sufficient available cash to pay our future financial liabilities.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.
1267425_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	All monies currently deposited, or that will be deposited in the future, into the Fund's working capital reserves are intended to be utilized to pay our existing and future liabilities.

1267425_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2017 and 2016.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Fund s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2017.
1267425_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49 (the Partnership ), in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related statements of operations, partners' capital (deficit) and cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2017.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Partnership's management is responsible for these financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( United States ).
1267425_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P45_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P45_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P45_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. - Series 47 through Series 49, in total and for each series, as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the total Partnership and for each series for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:
1267425_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $120,000 as of March 31, 2017 and 2016.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P55_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, of $959,317 and $6,348,580, respectively.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P61_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P61_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P63_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis .
1267425_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016 of $47,842 for Series 47, $54,923 for Series 48 and $46,810 for Series 49.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	As of March 31, 2016, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 1 year for Series 49.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	The amortization of deferred acquisition for the year ended March 31, 2017 is estimated to be $120,582 for Series 49.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:
1267425_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P69_S2	The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P69_S3	Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2013 remain open.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Cash equivalents include money market accounts having original maturities at date of acquisition of three months or less.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	The carrying value approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund uses a March 31 year-end, whereas for income tax reporting purposes, the Fund uses a calendar year.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	The operating limited partnerships use a calendar year for both financial and income tax reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	Net loss per beneficial assignee partnership unit is calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	The weighted average number of units in Series 47, 48 and 49 at March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:
1267425_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	During the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Fund entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Partners, Inc.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, are as follows:
1267425_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	All fund management fees will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the partnership's interests in operating limited partnerships.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P112_S1	Columbia-Blackshear Senior Residences, LP s management is responsible for these financial statements.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P112_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P113_S2	The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P113_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P113_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Columbia-Blackshear Senior Residences, LP as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2016, Columbia-Blackshear Senior Residences, LP adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	Columbia-Blackshear Senior Residences, LP (the Partnership) was formed as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Georgia on March 25, 2004, for the purpose of acquiring the land, holding, investing in, constructing, developing, improving, operating, leasing, maintaining, and otherwise dealing with an apartment project.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Project consists of 78 rental units located in Atlanta, Georgia, and operates under the name of Columbia Blackshear Senior Residences (the Project).
1267425_17_ITEM15_P117_S2	The partnership agreement was amended on December 1, 2005, and the investor limited partner was admitted.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Project qualified for and has been allocated federal and state low-income housing tax credits pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 42 (Section 42), which regulates the use of the Project as to occupant eligibility and unit gross rent, among other requirements.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	Each building of the Project must meet the provisions of these regulations during each of 15 consecutive years in order to remain qualified to receive the tax credits.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P118_S2	In addition, the Partnership has executed restrictive covenants for low-income housing tax credits, which requires the utilization of the Project pursuant to Section 42 for a minimum of 30 years, even if the Partnership disposes of the Project.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	Profits and losses and federal tax credits are allocated to the partners as follows:
1267425_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	However, 100 percent of state tax credits are allocated to the state credit limited partner.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	Debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, are reported as a direct deduction from the face amount of the mortgage loan payable to which such costs relate.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P123_S1	Amortization of debt issuance costs is reported as a component of interest expense and is computed using an imputed interest rate on the related loan.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P124_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Partnership s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	Accordingly, the Partnership is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	The Partnership is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P125_S3	The Partnership is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013 .

1267425_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P126_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	Tenant receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	Management s estimate of the allowance is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of tenant accounts receivable.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P127_S2	It is reasonably possible that management s estimate of the allowance will change.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	Tax credit monitoring fees are amortized over the compliance period using the straight-line method.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P128_S1	Estimated amortization expense for each of the five ensuing years is expected to be $7,120, annually.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	Rental income is recognized as rentals become due.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Partnership reviews its rental property for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	When recovery is reviewed, if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the property are less than its carrying amount, management compares the carrying amount of the property to its fair value in order to determine whether an impairment loss has occurred.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P131_S2	The amount of the impairment loss is equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

1267425_17_ITEM15_P134_S1	The change in accounting under ASU 2015-03 improves the reporting of debt issuance costs by no longer reporting them as assets.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P134_S2	It also improves the reporting of the related amortization by including it as a component of interest expense.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P134_S3	ASU 2015-03 has been adopted by the Partnership on a retrospective basis.
1267425_17_ITEM15_P134_S4	As a result, as of December 31, 2015, $94,105 of debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the Partnership s mortgage payable were reclassified on the balance sheet from other assets to mortgage payable and for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7,846 of amortization expense related to such debt issuance costs was reclassified to interest expense in the statement of operations, with no effect on previously reported net income (loss).

1267425_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner are assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ( BACs ) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (together with each subsequently filed prospectus, the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering (together with each subsequent offering of BACs described herein, the Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 10, 2004 a Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of March 31, 2018, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs in three series representing capital contributions of $117,777,060 in the aggregate.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ) each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund invests owns apartment complexes, which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ).
1267425_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Section 236(f)(ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving their rent supplements from HUD.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of apartment complexes.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2018 the Fund had invested in 12 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47; 9 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48; and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	A description of these Operating Partnerships is set forth in Item 2 herein.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	The business objectives of the Fund are to:
1267425_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Fund does not have any employees.
1267425_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Services are performed by the general partner and its affiliates and agents retained by them.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As used in this Item 1A, references to we, us and our mean the Fund.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	An investment in our BACs and our investments in Operating Partnerships are subject to risks.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in our BACs, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to our limited partners, if any, on liquidation of our investments.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The risks described below are not the only risks we face.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business operations.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from their investment in us is limited.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The IRS may audit us or an Operating Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to the investors could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in our BACs and/or the value of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Until the Operating Partnerships have completed a mandatory fifteen year Low Income Housing Tax Credit compliance period, investors are at risk for potential recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that have already been claimed.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated and noncompliance with these rules may have adverse consequences for BAC holders.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Noncompliance with applicable tax regulations may result in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last $25,000 of taxable income.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Operating Partnerships may be sold at a price which would not result in our realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Accordingly, we may be unable to distribute any cash to our investors.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in our BACs.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Poor performance of one housing complex, or the real estate market generally, could impair our ability to satisfy our investment objectives.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If an Operating Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years of the existence of the Fund, the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of previously claimed Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of our investment in the housing complex would occur.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	To the extent the Operating Partnerships receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks:
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	- possible changes in applicable regulations.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.

1267425_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of BACs, investors will realize taxable income to the extent that their allocable share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness on the apartment complexes, together with the money they receive from the sale of the BACs, is greater than the original cost of their BACs.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This realized taxable income is reduced to the extent that investors have suspended passive losses or credits.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	It is possible that the sale of BACs may not generate enough cash to pay the tax obligations arising from the sale.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Investors may have tax liability in excess of cash.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Investors eventually may be allocated profits for tax purposes which exceed any cash distributed to them.

1267425_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Similarly, in the event of a sale or foreclosure of an apartment complex or a sale of BACs, an investor may be allocated taxable income, resulting in tax liability, in excess of any cash distributed to him or her as a result of such event.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Investors may not receive cash if apartment complexes are sold .
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that investors will receive any cash distributions from the sale or refinancing of an apartment complex.

1267425_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if there are net cash proceeds from a sale, expenses such as accrued Fund management fees and unpaid loans will be deducted pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Fund Agreement.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any of these events happen, investors will not get all of their investment back, and the only benefit from an investment will be the tax credits received.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale or refinancing of the apartment complexes is dependent upon the following material factors:

1267425_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Substantially all of our existing liabilities are payable to our general partner and its affiliates.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Though the amounts payable to the general partner and its affiliates are contractually currently payable, we do not believe that the general partner or its affiliates will demand immediate payment of these contractual obligations in the near term; however, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
1267425_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We would be materially adversely affected if the general partner or its affiliates demanded payment in the near term of our existing contractual liabilities or suspended the provision of services to us because of our inability to satisfy these obligations.

1267425_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease is primarily the result of the way the Fund accounts for such investments, the equity method.

1267425_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	If the book value of the Fund s investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
1267425_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item is contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund s general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole, were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be included in the Fund s periodic SEC filings.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Fund s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Fund s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Fund s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2018.
1267425_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund management's internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Fund has no directors or executives officers of its own.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Schedules not listed are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information is included in the financial statements or the notes thereto.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	To the Partners Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Partnership ), as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital (deficit) and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
1267425_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P43_S2	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal security laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P44_S3	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P44_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P45_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P45_S3	We believe that our audits of the financial statements provide a reasonable basis for our opinion .
1267425_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	We have served as the Partnership s auditor since 2004.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the Fund or Partnership ) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating limited partnerships which have been organized to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated apartment complexes which qualified for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	Accordingly, the apartment complexes are restricted as to rent charges and operating methods.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V L.L.C. and the limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the assignor limited partner ).
1267425_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	In accordance with the limited partnership agreement, profits, losses, and cash flow (subject to certain priority allocations and distributions) and tax credits are allocated 99.75% to the assignees and .25% to the general partner.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the Prospectus ) were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ( Offering ) in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2005, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BAC's representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	The BAC s issued and outstanding in each series at March 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
1267425_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Fund accounts for its investments in operating limited partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each operating limited partnership s results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	However, the Fund recognizes the individual operating limited partnership s losses only to the extent that the Fund s share of losses from the operating limited partnerships does not exceed the carrying amount of its investment and its advances to operating limited partnerships.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P55_S2	Unrecognized losses are suspended and offset against future individual operating limited partnership income.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	After the investment account is reduced to zero, receivables due from the operating limited partnerships are decreased by the partnership s share of losses and, accordingly, a valuation allowance is recorded against the receivables.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	Accordingly, the Fund recorded a valuation allowance of $120,000 as of March 31, 2018 and 2017.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Fund reviews its investment in operating limited partnerships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments may not be recoverable.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax credits and the estimated residual value of the investment.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Fund also evaluates its intangibles for impairment in connection with its investments in operating limited partnerships.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P57_S3	Impairment losses have been recognized for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, of $238,657 and $959,317, respectively.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Capital contributions to operating limited partnerships are adjusted by tax credit adjusters.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Tax credit adjusters are defined as adjustments to operating limited partnership capital contributions due to reductions in actual tax credits from those originally projected.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Fund records tax credit adjusters as a reduction in investments in operating limited partnerships and capital contributions payable.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	The operating limited partnerships maintain their financial statements based on a calendar year and the Fund utilizes a March 31 year-end.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Fund records losses and income from the operating limited partnerships on a calendar year basis which is not materially different from losses and income generated if the operating limited partnerships utilized a March 31 year-end.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Fund records capital contributions payable to the operating limited partnerships once there is a binding obligation to fund a specified amount.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	The operating limited partnerships record capital contributions from the Fund when received.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party is required to consolidate the VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Fund determines whether an entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary at the date of initial involvement with the entity.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Fund reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on changes in facts and circumstances.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership considers the purpose and activities of the VIE, including the variability and related risks the VIE incurs and transfers to other entities and their related parties.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P63_S3	These factors are considered in determining whether the Fund has the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and whether the Fund also has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	If the Fund determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE is consolidated within the Partnership s financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Based on this guidance, the operating limited partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	However, management does not consolidate the Fund s interests in these VIEs under this guidance, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P65_S2	The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these operating limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of the operating limited partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P65_S3	The Fund s balance in investment in operating limited partnerships, advances to operating limited partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P65_S4	The Fund s exposure to loss on these operating limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying properties as well as the strength of the operating general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	As of March 31, 2016, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 1 year for Series 49.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P66_S2	As of March 31, 2017, acquisition costs were fully amortized or impaired for Series 49.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	Accumulated amortization as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:
1267425_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P68_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Fund s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a Fund.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P118_S3	As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P118_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P119_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Project qualified for and has been allocated federal and state low-income housing tax credits pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 42 (Section 42), which regulates the use of the Project as to occupant eligibility and unit gross rent, among other requirements.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P122_S1	Each building of the Project must meet the provisions of these regulations during each of 15 consecutive years in order to remain qualified to receive the tax credits.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P122_S2	In addition, the Partnership has executed restrictive covenants for low-income housing tax credits, which requires the utilization of the Project pursuant to Section 42 for a minimum of 30 years, even if the Partnership disposes of the Project.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	Amortization of debt issuance costs is reported as a component of interest expense and is computed using an imputed interest rate on the related loan.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	The Partnership's federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P131_S2	It is reasonably possible that management's estimate of the allowance will change.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Tax credit monitoring fees are amortized over the compliance period using the straight-line method.

1267425_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	When recovery is reviewed, if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the property are less than its carrying amount, management compares the carrying amount of the property to its fair value in order to determine whether an impairment loss has occurred.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P135_S2	The amount of the impairment loss is equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.
1267425_18_ITEM15_P135_S3	No impairment loss has been recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
