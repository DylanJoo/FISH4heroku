916365_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space.
916365_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for most new purpose-built locations.
916365_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized.
916365_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s Farm Supply, LLC ( Del s ), operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii.
916365_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Del s stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space.
916365_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment farm and ranch retail sales, both at our retail locations and online.
916365_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	At December 25, 2010, we operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states.
916365_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales.
916365_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores.
916365_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.
916365_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:
916365_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	By focusing our product mix on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.
916365_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We are committed to providing our customers a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members.
916365_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps to promote strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
916365_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	As such, we seek to provide our store team members with decision-making authority, product knowledge and training to enable them to meet our customers needs.
916365_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our training programs include (i) a full management training program which covers all aspects of our operations, (ii) product knowledge modules produced in conjunction with key vendors, (iii) frequent management skills training classes, (iv) semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations, (v) vendor sponsored in-store training programs and (vi) ongoing product information updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center.
916365_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We seek to hire and train store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.
916365_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our online shopping site is TractorSupply.com .
916365_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	The availability of certain of our products online provides our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We offer proprietary, private label credit cards for individuals and business customers.
916365_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	In addition, we accept cash, checks, debit cards, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards and gift cards.
916365_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Stores utilize several layouts, designed to provide an open environment, optimal product placement and visual display locations.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be easily changed for seasonal products and promotions.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S4	These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S5	The general uniformity of our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhances the shopping experience.
916365_11_ITEM1_P15_S6	To further enhance the shopping experience, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks and nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.
916365_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We offer a differentiated assortment of products for our customers.
916365_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our broad product assortment is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of our markets, as well as the physical store size.
916365_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 15,500 to 19,000 unique products per store.
916365_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2010.
916365_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our stores carry a wide selection of high quality, nationally recognized, name brand merchandise.
916365_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also market a growing list of products under our private-label programs, i.e. products manufactured for us by a number of vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The trademarks in the private label brand names are owned by us.
916365_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe that the availability of high quality private label products at compelling prices provides superior value for our customers, a strategic advantage for us, and positions us as a destination store.
916365_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The following chart indicates the average percentages of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.
916365_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We offer a differentiated assortment of products that are sourced through domestic and international vendors for those seeking to enjoy the Out Here lifestyle.
916365_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	We purchase our products from a core group of approximately 700 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	Approximately 250 vendors accounted for approximately 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our produc ts.
916365_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	We maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions.
916365_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	This centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews, assortment planning and testing of new products and programs.
916365_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Through the combined efforts of these teams, we have improved our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
916365_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Over 98% of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange ("EDI") system, and approximately 95% of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through EDI.
916365_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted.
916365_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	We currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2010 our stores received approximately 67% of our merchandise through this network.
916365_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our six distribution centers are located in Indiana, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Nebraska, and Washington, representing total distribution capacity of 2.9 million square feet.
916365_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	In 2011 we have begun construction on our seventh distribution center, a new 834,000 square foot facility in Kentucky to be operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
916365_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.
916365_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We utilize an "everyday value prices" strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by promotions primarily implemented during peak selling seasons.
916365_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.
916365_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	To generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and internet offerings.
916365_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.
916365_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Due to the relatively small size of our stores, increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products.
916365_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store.
916365_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design, brochures, point-of-purchase materials for customers education and product education for our team members.
916365_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume.
916365_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers, as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	Some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do.
916365_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	However, we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	As of December 25, 2010, we employed approximately 7,900 full-time and approximately 6,800 part-time team members.
916365_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our store operations are organized into nine regions, including Del s.
916365_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.
916365_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our regional managers, district managers, area managers, store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance.
916365_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ).
916365_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Utilizing the TVS system, we improve processes by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.
916365_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement project teams (comprised of team members from all areas of our operations) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes that will improve efficiency, reduce costs and strengthen processes.
916365_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improv ement activities.
916365_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We also provide our team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) savings plan solely through a cash match).
916365_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We encourage a promote from within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential team members for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our team members.
916365_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years.
916365_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth.
916365_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies.
916365_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a radio frequency and voice picking system in the distribution centers, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	We plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the rollout of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers, implementation of price optimization software, point-of-sale system upgrades, and store and support center hardware refreshes) in 2011.
916365_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition, we will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support the areas of store and distribution center expansion.
916365_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	These efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.
916365_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, global sourcing, and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth.
916365_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%.
916365_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	We project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011, an increase of approximately 8%.
916365_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	We opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009, an increase of approximately 8% and 9%, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	We operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores in the United States.
916365_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included as an unnumbered item in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 28, 2011.

916365_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our code of ethics, which is applicable to all of our team members, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, along with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of our Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, is posted on our website.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks which we are currently aware and we deem to be material are described below.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Additionally, changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales, along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory, could adversely affect our operations and operating results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competiti ve vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We experience fluctuations in our same-store sales, which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Various factors affect same-store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These factors may cause our same-store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Past same-store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our same-store sale s will not decrease in the future.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Even if we are able to implement, to a significant degree, our key business strategy of expanding our store base, we may experience managerial or operational problems, which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	To manage our planned expansion, we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems, controls and procedures, including product distribution facilities, store management, financial controls and information systems.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Capital requirements for growth may not be available.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under reasonable loan terms and conditions.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new purpose-built store s in desirable locations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	New stores may negatively impact our results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We operate in a very competitive market.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	However, we do face competition from these entities, as well as competition from independently-owned retail farm and ranch stores, privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Historically, weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In past years, we have experienced extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts in some states.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products, particularly during the winter heating season.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Accordingly, the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our working capital needs and borrowings (if necessary) generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred and inventory is increased in preparation for the spring and winter selling seasons.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide expected results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	There is no assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers needs or expectations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Additionally, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As a general rule, we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	This reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, restrictive actions by foreign governments, or changes in United States laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shu t down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We maintain general liability insurance with a deductible for each occurrence and a $36,000,000 aggregate retention applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers indemni ty will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because we are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company s business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to the Company.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively preclude others from obtaining improper access to this information.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We collect personal information from consumers in the course of doing business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Legal proceedings could materially impact our results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If we experience difficulties with our management information systems, our financial performance may be adversely affected.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Many of our information systems contain confidential customer, Company or employee data.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If we fail to adequately restrict access to this information, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S4	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to li tigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates or judgments.
916365_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.
916365_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 25, 2010, we operated 1,001 stores in 44 states.
916365_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We lease more than 94% of our stores, two of our six distribution centers and our management headquarters.
916365_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to our operations.
916365_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Following is a count of our store locations by state:
916365_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and c ertain injunctive relief.
916365_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company has notified these vendors of the EPA s position and expects to be reimbursed for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter.
916365_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
916365_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	We expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
916365_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings.
916365_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of January 31, 2011, the approximate number of record holders of our common stock was 120 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 37,000.
916365_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011.
916365_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	Stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2010 is set forth in the table below:
916365_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	(a) The number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share shown in the table above have been adjusted to reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split for all shares purchased prior to the stock split record date.
916365_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	Actual shares of 73,100, 149,311, and 230,100 were added to treasury in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively, as the number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the two-for-one stock split as stated in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
916365_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	(b) We withheld 25,982 (split adjusted) shares during the first quarter and 2,999 shares during the fourth quarter to satisfy employee tax obligations on the vesting of restricted stock units in the amounts of $0.7 million in the first quarter and $0.1 million in the fourth quarter at an average price of $25.30 and $42.00, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	For further discussion, see Note 2 Share-Based Compensation in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
916365_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC.
916365_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	Any additional share repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_11_ITEM5_P7_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	During 2010, the Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
916365_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay this quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company and other factors which the Board of Directors deems relevant.
916365_11_ITEM5_P9_S1	There were no dividends declared during fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	On February 4, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_11_ITEM5_P10_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2011.
916365_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Common Stock from December 31, 2005 to December 25, 2010 (the Company's fiscal year-end) with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_11_ITEM5_P12_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2005 in our Common Stock and in each of the foregoing indices.
916365_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
916365_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data are derived from the consolidated financial statements of Tractor Supply Company.
916365_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	All fiscal years presented below consist of 52 weeks.
916365_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, or market to the lower of cost, as determined by average cost method, or market.
916365_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	The following table provides summary historical financial information adjusted for the change in accounting for inventory for the periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating data):
916365_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	As discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K regarding our change in accounting for inventories from last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method, selected financial data has been retrospectively adjusted.
916365_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	Retrospective adjustments relating to fiscal 2009 and 2008 have been provided in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K:
916365_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	(b) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	(c) Adjusted to reflect two-for-one stock split that was effective September 2, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	( d) Reflects remodelings costing more than $150,000.
916365_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	(e) Includes assets acquired through capital leases.
916365_11_ITEM6_P8_S0	( f) Same-store sales increases (decreases) are calculated on an annual basis, including relocations in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and excluding relocations in 2007 and 2006, using all stores open at least one year.
916365_11_ITEM6_P9_S0	( g) Average sales per store is calculated based on total sales divided by the weighted average number of stores open in the year.
916365_11_ITEM6_P10_S0	( h) Long-term debt includes borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement and amounts outstanding under its capital lease obligations, excluding the current portion.
916365_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space.
916365_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for new purpose-built locations.
916365_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized.
916365_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s, operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii.
916365_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Del s stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space.
916365_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth.
916365_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%.
916365_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011, an increase of approximately 8%.
916365_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	We opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009, an increase of approximately 8% and 9%, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	We operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores in the United States.
916365_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2010 was $1.2 million for retrofit stores and $0.9 million for prototype stores.
916365_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $92,000 for pre-opening costs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings.
916365_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, or market to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers.
916365_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes.
916365_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	All financial information in Item 8 of this 10-K has been retrospectively adjusted.
916365_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our change in accounting method.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 36.3 million to approximately 72.7 million.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	Share and per-share amounts (including stock options and restricted stock units) shown in this Form 10-K reflect the split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores.
916365_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.
916365_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competiti ve vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services.
916365_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.
916365_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized when the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer.
916365_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Income is recognized when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for estimated unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns or breakage in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card and merchandise return card breakage.
916365_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, if actual consumer return or gift card and merchandise return card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	A 50 basis point change in our sales return rate at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $170,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	A 50 basis point change in our gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate would have affected net income by approximately $340,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand, and the promotional environment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $490,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes.
916365_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends and the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $815,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.
916365_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	During interim periods, the amount of e xpected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility.
916365_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 25, 2010, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.6 million.
916365_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $3.4 million.
916365_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan.
916365_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Share-Based Compensation, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our share-based compensation programs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	We estimate the fair value of our market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant utilizing average market price of our stock on the date of the related award.
916365_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards.
916365_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors.
916365_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition to the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value, the estimated forfeiture rate of the awarded options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of share-based compensation recognized.
916365_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	While we update our assumptions annually, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	The reported share-based compensation expense may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share-based compensation.
916365_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	A 10% change in our share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $750,000.
916365_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.
916365_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the regulatory support for the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the sales tax audit reserve in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve for current audits.
916365_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax liability reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $470,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures.
916365_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the st atute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements.
916365_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 25, 2010 would have affected net income by approximately $370,000 in fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.
916365_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.
916365_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	At December 26, 2009 all goodwill was associated with the Del s business and, for purposes of the fiscal 2009 impairment testing, Del s was considered the reporting unit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	In October 2010, we reevaluated the Del s reporting unit and concluded that since Del s has become closely aligned in terms of management, infrastructure, philosophy and performance, we now have only one reporting unit for goodwill impairment evaluation.
916365_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	All goodwill at December 25, 2010 is associated with the Company as a whole.
916365_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill, and determined there was no impairment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses.
916365_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies.
916365_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	Estimates include revenues, gross margins, operating costs and cash flows.
916365_11_ITEM7_P81_S3	We considered historical and estimated future results, economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies in deriving these estimates.
916365_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	In developing the key judgments and assumptions used to assess impairment, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ in some respects from actual results.
916365_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions persist, then key judgments and assumptions may be impacted.
916365_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	At December 25, 2010, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by a significant amount.
916365_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	However, if actual results are not consistent with our current estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset.
916365_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2010 and 2009 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Amounts have been adjusted for the change in inventory accounting method from LIFO to average cost.
916365_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The fiscal fourth quarter does not require an adjustment for the change in inventory accounting method as this change occurred during this period.
916365_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year.
916365_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 contain 52 weeks.
916365_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Company s election to change its method of accounting for inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method.
916365_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	This increase resulted from the opening of new stores and a 7.0% increase in same-store sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	The same-store average daily transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store transaction value decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Same-store sales increased 7.0% compared with a same-store sales decrease of 1.1% in the prior year.
916365_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	This same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment.
916365_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one store in fiscal 2009).
916365_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	The direct product margin improvement resulted from continued progress on margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing.
916365_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The improvement as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Net interest expense decreased 21.9% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings and a decline in interest charges associated with sales tax audits.
916365_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	This reduction in the tax resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock for $38.2 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program.
916365_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million.
916365_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Net sales increased 6.6% to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009 from $3.01 billion in fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	This increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in same-store sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	The same-store average daily transaction count increased 5.3%, while same-store transaction value decreased 6.0% for fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Same-store sales decreased 1.1% compared with a same-store sales increase of 1.4% in the prior year.
916365_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	This same-store sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket (merchandise priced $350 or greater) and discretionary merchandise, partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories, including animal and pet-related products.
916365_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	In fiscal 2009, we opened 76 new stores (compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008), relocated two stores (compared to one in fiscal 2008) and closed one store (compared to no stores in fiscal 2008).
916365_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Gross margin increased 9.1% to $1,041.9 million compared to $955.1 million in 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 32.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.8% for fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from lower transportation costs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses increased 60 basis points to 24.4% in fiscal 2009 from 23.8% in fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	This increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the same-store sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs, partially offset by reduced marketing costs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores.
916365_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Net interest expense decreased 22.9% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2008; however, net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales.
916365_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits.
916365_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 38.7% in fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	This reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes.
916365_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2009 increased 10.9% to $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $108.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	During 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $15.3 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program.
916365_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	In 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million.
916365_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.
916365_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Financial markets experienced volatility in the past few years, resulting in disruptions in credit and lending activities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	Further, disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	We have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions, if one occurs.
916365_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	At December 25, 2010, we had working capital of $617.1 million, a $141.2 million increase from December 26, 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	In comparison to prior year end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash and inventory.
916365_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	The increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings.
916365_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth.
916365_11_ITEM7_P122_S3	Average inventory per store remained nearly flat at $709,000 for fiscal 2010 compared to $707,000 for fiscal 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P122_S4	This was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year.
916365_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Accounts payable has declined as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account, which nets against accounts payable, as well as more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors.
916365_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases.
916365_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product.
916365_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	Certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period, typically within 10 to 15 days.
916365_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), which provides for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).
916365_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).
916365_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases.
916365_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
916365_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	There were $27.4 million and $35.2 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P126_S2	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate (3.25% at December 25, 2010) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.26% at December 25, 2010) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.40% at December 25, 2010).
916365_11_ITEM7_P126_S3	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.075% at December 25, 2010).
916365_11_ITEM7_P126_S4	There are no com pensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement.
916365_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).
916365_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiar ies or affiliates, and liens.
916365_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.
916365_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt, repurchase of the Company s common stock, and payment of common stock dividends.
916365_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity.
916365_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in inventory, net of accounts payable, and an increase in prepaids and other current assets.
916365_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances.
916365_11_ITEM7_P130_S3	Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account.
916365_11_ITEM7_P130_S4	The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable.
916365_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of pa yments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011.
916365_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The $2.4 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments, partially offset by higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses.
916365_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Inventory levels remained nearly flat in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009.
916365_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	Accounts payable levels have decreased substantially as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors.
916365_11_ITEM7_P133_S3	Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2009 but not paid until fiscal 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Investing activities used $112.1 million, $73.8 million and $88.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.
916365_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions):
916365_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets.
916365_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology.
916365_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P135_S3	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $150 million and $160 million in fiscal 2011.
916365_11_ITEM7_P135_S4	While we plan to open only a few more stores in 2011 compared to 2010, we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year as we construct a new distribution center and implement a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network, along with other efficiency-driving system enhancements in 2011.
916365_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Financing activities used $26.0 million, $5.6 million, and $105.5 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 is mainly the result of quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation.
916365_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011.
916365_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.
916365_11_ITEM7_P137_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	We repurchased approximately 0.8 million, 0.4 million and 1.6 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $38.2 million, $15.3 million and $53.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.
916365_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P139_S2	As of December 25, 2010, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $142.8 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years.
916365_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 25, 2010 (in thousands):
916365_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	(1) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	(2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores and a distribution center expected to be opened in fiscal 2011.
916365_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $27.4 million as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	The balances for these arrangements are discussed above.
916365_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.
916365_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner.
916365_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810 (originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. ( FIN ) 46(R) ).
916365_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprise s application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the enterprise s involvement with variable interest entities.
916365_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.
916365_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	There was no impact on the C ompany s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.
916365_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 (ASU No. 2010-09), Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.
916365_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed.
916365_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP.
916365_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance.
916365_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement.
916365_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank s base rate (3.25% at both December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009) or LIBOR (0.26% and 0.23% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.40% and 0.50% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively).
916365_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.075% at December 25, 2010 and 0.10% December 26, 2009).
916365_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
916365_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations o f management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on the COSO criteria .
916365_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010 and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
916365_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for inventory from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in first-out (LIFO) method, or market, to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market, effective December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tractor Supply Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split as discussed in Note 1.
916365_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split, except for repurchase of common stock as the number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split.
916365_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	See Note 1 for more information.
916365_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Net income and retained earnings for all periods prior to 2010 have been adjusted to reflect the change in accounting for inventory.
916365_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	See Note 1 for more information.
916365_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies :
916365_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Tractor Supply Company (the Company , we , us and/or our ) is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.
916365_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	We are focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s Farm Supply, LLC ( Del s ) operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	At December 25, 2010, we operated a total of 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks.
916365_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 consist of 52 weeks.
916365_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from lower of cost, as determined by the LIFO method, or market, to lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers.
916365_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes.
916365_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	As a result of the retrospective change in accounting principle, opening retained earnings as of December 29, 2007 increased by $15.6 million.
916365_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	The effect of the change in method on previously reported consolidated operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was to increase net income by $4.3 million ($0.05 per dilutive share), and $26.1 million ($0.35 per dilutive share), respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	The effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2009 was to increase inventory, tax liabilities and retained earnings by $75.2 million, $29.3 million and $45.9 million, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Certain components of the Company s financial statements affected by the change in costing methodology as originally reported under the LIFO method and as adjusted for the change to the average cost method are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
916365_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	* As described below, certain other amounts in the previously issued balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 36.3 million to approximately 72.7 million.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S3	Share and per-share amounts (including stock options and restricted stock units) shown in the consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the split.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S4	The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.
916365_11_ITEM8_P24_S5	The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split .
916365_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Marketing support fund receivables due from vendors previously classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets have been reclassified to reduce vendor accounts payable ($11.6 million at December 26, 2009).
916365_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Amounts related to accrued employee compensation ($22.7 million at December 26, 2009) have been reclassified from other accrued expenses to accrued employee compensation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	A portion of the liabilities related to self-insured workers compensation and general liability claims ($14.0 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified in other accrued expenses have been reclassified to other long-term liabilities to reflect their long-term status.
916365_11_ITEM8_P25_S4	Also amou nts related to tenant improvement allowances ($18.0 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified in other long-term liabilities and amounts related to straight-line rent ($45.5 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified as straight-line rent liability have been reclassified as deferred rent to conform to the December 25, 2010 presentation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	These changes have affected our December 26, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008.
916365_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the operation of farm and ranch retail stores.
916365_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	We also offer a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.
916365_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	At December 25, 2010 we had a liability of $3.0 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.1 million at December 26, 2009.
916365_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	We recognize revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognize income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift card and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	We recognized income of $1.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.
916365_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.
916365_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	During the interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ significantly from the previously estimated amounts.
916365_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan, covering certain members of management and non-employee directors.
916365_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards.
916365_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options.
916365_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	We adjust this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience.
916365_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	At December 25, 2010 , we had recorded net insurance reserves of $29.0 million compared to $23.7 million at December 26, 2009.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_11_ITEM8_P50_S5	While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, will not have a significant liabil ity for disallowed exemptions.
916365_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit.
916365_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_11_ITEM8_P51_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures.
916365_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant ta x authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup ( Citigroup ), consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and distribution centers, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Preopening costs were approximately $7.1 million, $7.5 million and $8.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under-performing.
916365_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	We record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
916365_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value.
916365_11_ITEM8_P66_S2	We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009.
916365_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Our short-term investment in a U.S. Treasury note is classified as Level 1 as these types of investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
916365_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The U.S. Treasury note is held as collateral for a standby letter of credit and is expected to be held to maturity.
916365_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	The fair value of short-term investments at December 25, 2010 was $15.9 million.
916365_11_ITEM8_P67_S3	We had no short-term investments at December 26, 2009.
916365_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Approximately 250 vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases for fiscal 2010, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of purchases during the year.
916365_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers; from our distribution centers to our retail stores; and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_11_ITEM8_P73_S2	Distribution center costs for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $64.4 million, $59.0 million and $52.8 million, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.
916365_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.
916365_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	Reimbursements are primarily for the purpose of performing work required to divide a much larger location into smaller segments, one of which we will use for our store.
916365_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	This work could include the addition of demising walls, separation of plumbing, utilities, electric work, entrances (front and back) and other work as required.
916365_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	Related reimbursements are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.
916365_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	et s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset.
916365_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	In fiscal 2010, the company recognized impairment charges of $1.1 million related to the write-off of certain capitalized software development costs.
916365_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	These assets were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.
916365_11_ITEM8_P87_S2	During fiscal year 2009 impairment charges of $0.8 million were recorded representing the amount required to write-down the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements to the assets estimated fair value.
916365_11_ITEM8_P87_S3	Impairment charges are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
916365_11_ITEM8_P87_S4	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2008.
916365_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.
916365_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.
916365_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	All goodwill at December 25, 2010 is associated with the Company as a whole.
916365_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	At December 26, 2009 all goodwill was associated with the Del s business and, for purposes of the fiscal 2009 impairment testing, Del s was considered the reporting unit.
916365_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	In October 2010, we reevaluated the Del s reporting unit and concluded that since Del s has be come closely aligned in terms of management, infrastructure, philosophy and performance, we now have only one reporting unit for goodwill impairment evaluation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.
916365_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_11_ITEM8_P91_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations.
916365_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.
916365_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper advertisements and other promotions.
916365_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_11_ITEM8_P94_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.6 million, $45.7 million and $58.0 million, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P94_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	We account for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
916365_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for options and restricted stock units.
916365_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
916365_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all options and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_11_ITEM8_P97_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the grant date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	Share-based compensation expense including reductions in expense for modifications of awards was $11.8 million, $12.1 million and $12.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	Effective May 7, 2009, the Company adopted the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan replacing the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	Following the adoption of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	Under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and other employees.
916365_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	Also, the aggregate fair market value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable on a tax deferred basis for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.
916365_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	Under the terms of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 6,200,000 shares are available for grant as stock options or other awards.
916365_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	At December 25, 2010, we had 5,146,530 shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date.
916365_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	We have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	The weighted averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	We use actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to calculate expected price volatility because we believe that this is the best indicator of future volatility.
916365_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_11_ITEM8_P106_S3	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_11_ITEM8_P107_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_11_ITEM8_P108_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested.
916365_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_11_ITEM8_P109_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.
916365_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	We issue new shares for options when exercised.
916365_11_ITEM8_P111_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows:
916365_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total difference between our closing stock price at each year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at each year-end.
916365_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	As of December 25, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options is $9,156,000 with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.4 years.
916365_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	There were no material modifications to options in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
916365_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Other information relative to option activity during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	We issue shares for restricted stock unit awards once vesting occurs and related restrictions lapse.
916365_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	The units vest over a one to three-year term.
916365_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	The status of restricted stock units is presented below:
916365_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Other information relative to restricted unit activity during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements that we pay on behalf of our employees.
916365_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	We issued 90,203, 10,896, and 2,020 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
916365_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	The 2010 amount is net of 28,981 shares, withheld to satisfy $0.8 million of employees tax obligations.
916365_11_ITEM8_P118_S3	Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.

916365_11_ITEM8_P125_S2	The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.

916365_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each.
916365_11_ITEM8_P126_S3	Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the year.
916365_11_ITEM8_P126_S4	The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P126_S5	Generally, most of the leases also require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.

916365_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate, is $3.7 million at December 25, 2010.

916365_11_ITEM8_P145_S4	In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the employee exceed 4.5% of the employee s eligible compensation.
916365_11_ITEM8_P145_S5	All current contributions are immediately 100% vested.
916365_11_ITEM8_P145_S6	Company contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, were approximately $3.7 million, $3.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

916365_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	At December 25, 2010, we had commitments related to construction projects for new stores and a distribution center totaling approximately $32.2 million.
916365_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_11_ITEM8_P149_S2	The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and c ertain injunctive relief.

916365_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810 (originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. ( FIN ) 46(R) ).
916365_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprise s application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the enterprise s involvement with variable interest entities.
916365_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.
916365_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM8_P154_S2	There was no impact on the C ompany s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.
916365_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 (ASU No. 2010-09), Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.
916365_11_ITEM8_P155_S1	The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed.
916365_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP.
916365_11_ITEM8_P156_S1	ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance.
916365_11_ITEM8_P156_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	On February 4, 2011, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2011.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 25, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 25, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

916365_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
916365_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 19,000 square feet of inside selling space along with additional outside selling space.
916365_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We use a standard 15,250 square foot prototype for most new built-to-suit locations.
916365_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	In some smaller markets we utilize a 12,500 square foot format with slightly less inventory and lower occupancy cost than our prototype but a similar product assortment.
916365_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized.
916365_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment farm and ranch retail sales, both at our retail locations and online.
916365_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	At December 31, 2011, we operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states.
916365_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:
916365_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	By focusing our product mix on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.
916365_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members.
916365_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.
916365_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
916365_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	As such, we provide our store team members with training, product knowledge and decision-making authority to enable them to meet our customers needs.
916365_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our training programs include (i) a management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations, (ii) regular training on customer service and selling skills, (iii) product knowledge modules produced in conjunction with key vendors, (iv) frequent management skills training classes, (v) semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations, (vi) vendor sponsored in-store training programs, and (vii) ongoing product information updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center.
916365_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	We hire and train store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.
916365_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.
916365_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.
916365_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Based on the third party provider s data, we consider our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best in class.
916365_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	We critically evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and initiate improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Stores utilize several layouts designed to provide an open environment, optimal product placement and visual display locations.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S5	These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S6	The general uniformity of our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhances the shopping experience.
916365_12_ITEM1_P12_S7	To further enhance the shopping experience, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.
916365_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We offer a differentiated assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the Out Here lifestyle.
916365_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our broad product assortment is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of our markets, as well as the physical store size.
916365_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 16,000 to 19,500 unique products per store.
916365_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2011.
916365_12_ITEM1_P13_S4	Additionally, our store team members utilize our special order process to assist customers with related products we do not carry in our stores.
916365_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our stores carry a wide selection of high quality, nationally recognized, name brand merchandise.
916365_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We also market a growing list of products under our private-label programs, i.e. products manufactured for us by a number of vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	The trademarks in the private label brand names are owned by us.
916365_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our private label brands represented approximately 23% of our total sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 21% of our total sales in fiscal 2010 and 2009.
916365_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our private label brand names include:
916365_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that our ability to offer high quality private label products at compelling prices provides superior value for our customers, a strategic advantage for us, and positions us as a destination store.
916365_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009:
916365_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We purchase our products from a core group of approximately 700 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Approximately 275 vendors accounted for approximately 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.
916365_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	We maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions.
916365_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	This centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews, assortment planning and testing of new products and programs.
916365_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
916365_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	We currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2011 our stores received approximately 70% of our merchandise through this network, while approximately 30% of our merchandise is shipped direct to the store from our vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our seven distribution centers are located in Kentucky, Indiana, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Nebraska, and Washington, representing total distribution capacity of 3.7 million square feet.
916365_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	In 2011 we completed construction of the 834,000 square foot facility in Kentucky, which became operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	We continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers, and currently two of our seven facilities are utilizing a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through automation.
916365_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	We will continue to refine this new system, and expect that it will be implemented across the entire distribution network over the next few years.
916365_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.
916365_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We utilize an "everyday value prices" strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
916365_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.
916365_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	To generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings.
916365_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.
916365_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.
916365_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	We do business with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, website, email and direct mail.
916365_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.
916365_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Additionally, we give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	However, we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 8,700 full-time and approximately 7,700 part-time team members.
916365_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our store operations are organized into nine regions.
916365_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.
916365_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our regional managers, district managers, area managers, store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance.
916365_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also provide our team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) savings plan solely through a cash match).
916365_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	We encourage a promote from within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential team members for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our team members.
916365_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average length of service of approximately six years.
916365_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ), which is our catalyst to drive continuous improvement throughout our organization.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Utilizing TVS, we improve processes by identifying and accepting the need for change of current practices to reduce costs, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (comprised of team members from all areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes that will improve efficiency, reduce costs and strengthen processes.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	Team members are empowered and expected to challenge long-held paradigms and improve processes.
916365_12_ITEM1_P32_S5	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
916365_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies.
916365_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a warehouse management system, a radio frequency and voice-activated picking system in the distribution centers, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the continued rollout of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers, point-of-sale system upgrades, enhanced security tools, and store and support center hardware refreshes) in 2012.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Additionally, we will be upgrading our e-commerce website which will include the integration of order management, drop shipment, fulfillment and call center activities.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	We will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support store and distribution center expansion.
916365_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	These efforts are directed toward constantly improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.
916365_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong private label offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth.
916365_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.3%.
916365_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	We plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012, a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0%.
916365_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	We opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010, a square footage increase of approximately 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	We operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores, inclusive of recently identified small market locations.
916365_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	We lease approximately 93% of our store sites and own the remaining 7% of store sites.
916365_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	We are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner.
916365_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers.

916365_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	He served as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Central Parking Corporation, a parking services company, from 1998 to 2008.
916365_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our code of ethics, which is applicable to all of our team members, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, along with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of our Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, is posted on our website.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Additionally, changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales, along with slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory, could adversely affect our operations and operating results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Due to the competitive environment, such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We experience fluctuations in our same-store sales, which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Various factors affect same-store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These factors may cause our same-store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Past same-store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our same-store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Even if we are able to implement, to a significant degree, our key business strategy of expanding our store base, we may experience managerial or operational problems, which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	To manage our planned expansion, we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems, controls and procedures, including product distribution facilities, store management, financial controls and information systems.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Capital requirements for growth may not be available.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under reasonable loan terms and conditions.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new built-to-suit stores in desirable locations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Failure to open new stores in the manner and number currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We operate in a very competitive market.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	However, we do face competition from these entities, as well as competition from independently-owned retail farm and ranch stores, privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Historically, weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In past years, we have experienced extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts in some states.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products, particularly during the winter heating season.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Accordingly, the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	There is no assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers needs or expectations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Additionally, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As a general rule, we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	This reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, restrictive actions by foreign governments, or changes in United States laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company s business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to the Company.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively preclude others from obtaining improper access to this information.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We collect personal information from consumers in the course of doing business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we experience difficulties with our management information systems, our financial performance may be adversely affected.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame, cost and functionality, our strategic business initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2011, we operated 1,085 stores in 44 states.
916365_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We lease approximately 93% of our stores, two of our seven distribution centers and our management headquarters.
916365_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to our operations.
916365_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Following is a count of our store locations by state:
916365_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and certain injunctive relief.
916365_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with three vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company has notified these vendors of the EPA s position and currently is working with these vendors to provide additional information to the DOJ and EPA regarding the alleged violations.
916365_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company expects to be reimbursed by these vendors for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter.
916365_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	We do not believe it is reasonably possible that a loss in excess of the amount accrued will be incurred.
916365_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	We expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of January 31, 2012, the approximate number of record holders of our common stock was 585 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 100,000.
916365_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	On April 28, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a $600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $1 billion through April 2015.
916365_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	Stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2011 is set forth in the table below:
916365_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	(b) On April 28, 2011, the Board authorized a $600 million increase to its existing share repurchase program.
916365_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC.
916365_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Any additional share repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_12_ITEM5_P7_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	During 2011, the Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
916365_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	During 2010, the Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
916365_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay this quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company and other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	On February 8, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_12_ITEM5_P11_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 13, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 27, 2012.

916365_12_ITEM5_P13_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Common Stock from December 30, 2006 to December 31, 2011 (the Company's fiscal year-end) with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_12_ITEM5_P13_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 30, 2006 in our Common Stock and in each of the foregoing indices.
916365_12_ITEM5_P14_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
916365_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Tractor Supply Company.
916365_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_12_ITEM6_P0_S2	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_12_ITEM6_P0_S3	Fiscal year 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years below consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	The following table provides summary historical financial information for the periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	(a) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) Same-store sales increases (decreases) are calculated on an annual basis, including relocations in 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and excluding relocations in 2007, using all stores open at least one year.
916365_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	(c) Average sales per store is calculated based on total sales divided by the weighted average number of stores open in the year.
916365_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	(d) Long-term debt includes borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement and amounts outstanding under its capital lease obligations, excluding the current portion.
916365_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores, inclusive of recently identified small market locations.
916365_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2011 was once again a year of strong performance for our Company.
916365_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We achieved double-digit increases in both sales and earnings on top of last year s record results.
916365_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In fiscal 2011, our net revenues increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion compared to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010, and we increased our fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share to $3.01 versus $2.25 in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	We also ended the year with $199 million in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly $211 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.3%.
916365_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012, a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0%.
916365_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010, a square footage increase of approximately 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong private label offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth.
916365_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures, limited maintenance capital, and low occupancy and operating costs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2011 was approximately $1.2 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $82,000 for pre-opening costs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years.
916365_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements (to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems), and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $166.2 million and $96.5 million, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $160 million to $170 million as we continue to invest in new store growth, existing stores, distribution center capacity and information technology.
916365_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings.
916365_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing, improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers.
916365_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $590,000 in fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes.
916365_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $860,000 in fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.
916365_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	During interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility.
916365_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 31, 2011, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.1 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.
916365_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state.
916365_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our sales tax audit assessment methodology remained materially consistent in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $720,000 in fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 31, 2011 would have affected net income by approximately $460,000 in fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2011 and 2010 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 contained 52 weeks.
916365_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.
916365_12_ITEM7_P70_S6	Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast.
916365_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories.
916365_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points.
916365_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Store growth was approximately 8.4%, a net increase of 84 stores since December 25, 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Non-comp sales (defined as stores opened less than one year) for fiscal 2011 were $237.5 million, a 6.4% increase over total fiscal 2010 net sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	In fiscal 2011, we opened 85 new stores (compared to 74 new stores in fiscal 2010), relocated three stores (compared to no relocations in fiscal 2010) and closed one store (compared to three closed stores in fiscal 2010).
916365_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010:
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, private branding and price optimization.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	We expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	Additionally, we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases.
916365_12_ITEM7_P75_S6	However, we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management.
916365_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system.
916365_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company s new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	During 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.
916365_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	In 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	Same-store sales for fiscal 2010 were $3.43 billion, a 7.0% increase over fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	This compares to a 1.1% same-store sales decrease in the prior year.
916365_12_ITEM7_P81_S3	The same-store transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store average ticket decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P81_S4	The same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	New store growth was approximately 7.6% or 71 net stores opened since December 26, 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Non-comp sales for fiscal 2009 were $230.7 million, a 7.7% increase over total fiscal 2008 net sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two relocations in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2009).
916365_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010 and 2009:
916365_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	The direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing.
916365_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense.
916365_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Total SG A expenses increased 10.2% to $937.4 million from $850.3 million in fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales growth and increased incentive compensation.
916365_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009.
916365_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $38.2 million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program.
916365_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends.
916365_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $629.6 million, a $12.5 million increase from December 25, 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	In comparison to prior year-end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in cash.
916365_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation.
916365_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	Average inventory per store increased to $723,000 for fiscal 2011 compared to $709,000 for fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures, principally due to the construction of a new distribution center.
916365_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Through October 23, 2011 we were party to a Senior Credit Facility (the Credit Agreement ), which provided for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively) with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).
916365_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February 2012.
916365_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	On October 24, 2011, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement.
916365_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sublimits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).
916365_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility.
916365_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	There were $15.0 million and $27.4 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.30% at December 31, 2011) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio (0.50% at December 31, 2011).
916365_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 31, 2011).
916365_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).
916365_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_12_ITEM7_P97_S4	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.
916365_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and payment of common stock dividends.
916365_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity.
916365_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets.
916365_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center.
916365_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments.
916365_12_ITEM7_P100_S4	The increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors.
916365_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory, net of accounts payable, and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets.
916365_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances.
916365_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account.
916365_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable.
916365_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	The increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	The decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors.
916365_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Investing activities used $171.3 million, $112.1 million and $73.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.
916365_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions):
916365_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	The above table reflects 85 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2011, compared to 74 new stores during fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	We also purchased 12 of our existing lease stores during fiscal 2011 compared to four existing stores in fiscal 2010.
916365_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	The increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers.
916365_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets.
916365_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $160 million and $170 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	We plan to open approximately five to 10 more stores in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P106_S3	While we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal 2012, we estimate to spend approximately $30 million on our distribution center network, principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements.
916365_12_ITEM7_P106_S4	Additionally, we plan to invest approximately $30 million in information technology upgrades, including point-of-sale system enhancements, continued roll-out of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers, an upgrade of our e-commerce site, and store and store support center hardware refreshes.
916365_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Financing activities used $163.2 million, $26.0 million, and $5.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation.
916365_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	On April 28, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a $600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $1 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015.
916365_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.
916365_12_ITEM7_P108_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	We repurchased approximately 3.1 million, 0.8 million and 0.4 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $180.0 million, $38.2 million and $15.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $562.9 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.07 per share to $0.12 per share.
916365_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	We paid dividends totaling $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years.
916365_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
916365_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	(1) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	(2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2012, as well as the purchase of a previously leased store.
916365_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	At December 31, 2011, there were $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $20.9 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash.
916365_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	The letter of credit outside the Senior Credit Facility will automatically increase by $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to $21.9 million.
916365_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	The balances for these arrangements are discussed above.
916365_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.
916365_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
916365_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount ( qualitative assessment ).
916365_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test.
916365_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank s base rate (3.25% at both December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010) or LIBOR (0.30% and 0.26% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% at December 31, 2011 and 0.35% to 0.90% at December 25, 2010) based on our leverage ratio (0.50% and 0.40% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively).
916365_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% at December 31, 2011 and 0.06% to 0.18% at December 25, 2010) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at December 31, 2011 and 0.08% December 25, 2010).
916365_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales.
916365_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation.
916365_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_12_ITEM7_P124_S3	Due to the competitive environment, such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
916365_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria .
916365_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
916365_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tractor Supply Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Tractor Supply Company (the Company , we , us and/or our ) is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.
916365_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	We are focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	At December 31, 2011, we operated a total of 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks.
916365_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks.
916365_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.
916365_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_12_ITEM8_P23_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	During interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ significantly from the previously estimated amounts.
916365_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	At December 31, 2011, we had recorded net insurance reserves of $31.2 million compared to $29.0 million at December 25, 2010.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_12_ITEM8_P28_S5	While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, will not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state.
916365_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_12_ITEM8_P29_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_12_ITEM8_P30_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	In fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.5 million and $1.1 million related to the write-off of certain capitalized software development costs.
916365_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	These assets were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	During fiscal year 2009 impairment charges of $0.8 million were recorded representing the amount required to write-down the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements to the assets estimated fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	If we receive payment before completion of our customer obligations (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.
916365_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	At December 31, 2011 we had a liability of $3.7 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.0 million at December 25, 2010.
916365_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	We recognize revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognize income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift card and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	We recognized breakage income of $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers, from our distribution centers to our retail stores, and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and direct mail, as well as limited television, radio and other promotions.
916365_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $56.0 million, $48.6 million and $45.7 million, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	Distribution center costs for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $76.8 million, $64.4 million and $59.0 million, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and distribution centers, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Preopening costs were approximately $7.3 million, $7.1 million and $7.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan, covering certain members of management and non-employee directors.
916365_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards.
916365_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options.
916365_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	We adjust this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.
916365_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company s comprehensive income is equal to net income in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.
916365_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit card transactions settle within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
916365_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup ( Citigroup ), consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they settle within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
916365_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company s restricted cash consisted of a $21.9 million time deposit held as collateral for a letter of credit for certain insurance policies through April 1, 2012.
916365_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	At December 25, 2010, the Company s short-term held-to-maturity investments consisted of a $15.9 million one-year U.S. Treasury note held as collateral for a letter of credit.
916365_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	The note matured on May 11, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	We had no short-term investments at December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010.
916365_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The short-term investment note is classified as Level 1 as these types of investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
916365_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	This investment is stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
916365_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	We entered into an agreement with various governmental entities in the state of Kentucky to implement a tax abatement plan related to a new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County).
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	The tax abatement plan provides for abatement of real property taxes for up to thirty years with the exception of taxes levied by the Simpson County Board of Education.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	Under the plan, legal title to our real property was transferred to the City of Franklin, Kentucky ( Franklin ) effective December 2011, and Franklin issued bonds with a principal amount of $51.8 million.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	The bonds were issued to the Company, so no cash was exchanged.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S4	Franklin then leased the real property back to the Company.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S5	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S6	At any time, we have the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S7	Due to the form of the transaction, we have not recorded the bond or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_12_ITEM8_P76_S8	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	Computer software consists primarily of third-party software purchased for internal use.
916365_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_12_ITEM8_P78_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.
916365_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.
916365_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_12_ITEM8_P81_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_12_ITEM8_P81_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations.
916365_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.
916365_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under-performing.
916365_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	We record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.
916365_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_12_ITEM8_P88_S2	Related reimbursements are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.
916365_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
916365_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all stock options and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_12_ITEM8_P89_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the grant date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company's share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2011.
916365_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	Share-based compensation expense including changes in expense for modifications of awards was $15.0 million, $11.8 million and $12.1 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	Under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and other employees.
916365_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	Under the terms of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 6,200,000 shares are available for grant as stock options or other awards.
916365_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	At December 31, 2011, we had 4,587,083 shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	We have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_12_ITEM8_P96_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	We use actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to calculate expected price volatility because we believe that this is the best indicator of future volatility.
916365_12_ITEM8_P97_S2	We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_12_ITEM8_P97_S3	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested.
916365_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	We issue new shares for options when exercised.
916365_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows:
916365_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total difference between our closing stock price at each year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at each year-end.
916365_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options is $10.1 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.3 years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	There were no material modifications to options in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
916365_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	Other information relative to option activity during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	We issue shares for restricted stock unit awards once vesting occurs and related restrictions lapse.
916365_12_ITEM8_P107_S1	The units vest over a one to three-year term; some plan participants have elected to defer receipt of shares of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock units, and as a result, shares are not issued until a later date.
916365_12_ITEM8_P107_S2	The status of restricted stock units is presented below:
916365_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	Other information relative to restricted unit activity during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements that we pay on behalf of our employees.
916365_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	We issued 68,007 90,203, and 10,896 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.
916365_12_ITEM8_P109_S3	The 2011 and 2010 amounts are net of 20,383 and 28,981 shares, withheld to satisfy $1.1 million and $0.8 million of employees tax obligations, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	There were no material modifications to restricted stock units in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
916365_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units is $3.8 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.5 years.
916365_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	The ESPP provides our employees the opportunity to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common stock at a 15% discount.
916365_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, we issued 53,333, 74,788 and 101,470 shares of common stock during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation expense calculations, was approximately $642,000, $439,000 and $449,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	At December 31, 2011, there were 6,246,519 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.
916365_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	Through October 23, 2011 we were party to a Senior Credit Facility (the Credit Agreement ), which provided for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively) with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).
916365_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February 2012.
916365_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	On October 24, 2011, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement.
916365_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sublimits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).
916365_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility.
916365_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	There were $15.0 million and $27.4 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P116_S2	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (0.30% at December 31, 2011) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio (0.50% at December 31, 2011).
916365_12_ITEM8_P116_S3	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 31, 2011).
916365_12_ITEM8_P116_S4	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).
916365_12_ITEM8_P117_S2	The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_12_ITEM8_P117_S3	The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_12_ITEM8_P117_S4	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	We lease the majority of our office space and retail store locations, certain distribution centers, transportation equipment and other equipment under various noncancellable operating leases.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	The leases have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2029 for both capital leases and operating leases.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S3	Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the year.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S4	The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.
916365_12_ITEM8_P118_S5	Generally, most of the leases also require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
916365_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	Total rent expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $186.8 million, $173.4 million and $162.2 million, respectively.
916365_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	Total contingent rent expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was insignificant.
916365_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more consist of the following (in thousands):
916365_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	Assets under capital leases were as follows (in thousands):
916365_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of common stock and preferred stock.

916365_12_ITEM8_P145_S2	If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test.
916365_12_ITEM8_P145_S3	The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.

916365_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act.
916365_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

916365_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
916365_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Wright, Chief Executive Officer, and Anthony F. Crudele, Chief Financial Officer, of the Company, certify, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. section 1350), that to the best of our knowledge:
916365_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
916365_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Feed Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of farm and ranch products.
916365_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	At December 29, 2012 , we operated 1,176 retail farm and ranch stores in 45 states.
916365_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 19,000 square feet of inside selling space along with additional outside selling space.
916365_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	We use a standard 15,500 square foot design for most new built-to-suit locations.
916365_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	In some smaller markets we use a 12,500 square foot format with slightly less inventory and lower occupancy costs than our prototype but with a similar product assortment.
916365_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:
916365_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Market Niche We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.
916365_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Customer Service We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members.
916365_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.
916365_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
916365_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	As such, we provide our store team members with training, product knowledge and decision-making authority to enable them to meet our customers needs.
916365_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our training programs include (i) a management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations, (ii) regular training on customer service and selling skills, (iii) product knowledge and in-store training programs produced in conjunction with key vendors, (iv) frequent management skills training classes, (v) semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations, and (vi) ongoing product information updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center.
916365_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	We hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.
916365_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.
916365_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.
916365_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Based on the third party provider s data, we consider our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.
916365_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	We critically evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S4	Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S5	These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S6	Our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience.
916365_13_ITEM1_P7_S7	To further enhance the shopping experience, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.
916365_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Merchandising We offer a differentiated assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the Out Here lifestyle.
916365_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our broad product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in our various geographic markets, as well as the physical store size.
916365_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 16,000 to 19,500 products per store.
916365_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 :
916365_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our buying team constantly reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs.
916365_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, edible (C.U.E.) products.
916365_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Examples of C.U.E product categories include, but are not limited to livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products such as pest control and twine.
916365_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	We purchase our products from a core group of approximately 800 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	Approximately 300 vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.
916365_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our buying team focuses on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews, assortment planning and testing of new products and programs.
916365_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions.
916365_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
916365_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Intellectual Property Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP ( TSCT ), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) for the service marks TSC , Tractor Supply Co. , TSC Tractor Supply Co. and the trapezium design for retail store services.
916365_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business.
916365_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.
916365_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.
916365_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provides value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.
916365_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our exclusive brands represented approximately 25% , 23% and 21% of our total sales in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The exclusive brands identified above have been registered with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.
916365_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.
916365_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, copyrights and patents, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Distribution We currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2012 our stores received approximately 70% of our merchandise through this network while approximately 30% of our merchandise is shipped direct to the store from our vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance sales and improve our inventory turnover rate.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our seven distribution centers, located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of 3.8 million square feet.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	In 2012 , we started construction on a new distribution center, a 686,000 square foot facility in Macon, Georgia, which will replace our 521,000 square foot leased distribution center in Braselton, Georgia and become operational in mid-to-late 2013.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	We continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers, and currently three of our seven facilities utilize a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation.
916365_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	We will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented across the entire distribution network over the next few years.
916365_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	We select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores.
916365_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.
916365_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Marketing We utilize an "everyday value price" strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
916365_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.
916365_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	To generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings.
916365_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.
916365_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.
916365_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Multi-Channel We engage our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website ( tractorsupply.com ), email and direct mail.
916365_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.
916365_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Additionally, in 2013 we will be upgrading our e-commerce website which will include the integration of order management, drop shipment and fulfillment.
916365_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Management and Team Members As of December 29, 2012 , we employed approximately 9,400 full-time and 7,900 part-time team members.
916365_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our store operations are organized into eight regions.
916365_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Each region is led by a regional manager, and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.
916365_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) retirement savings plan solely through a cash match).
916365_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high-potential team members for continued progress.
916365_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average length of service of approximately six years.
916365_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Continuous Improvement We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ), which is our catalyst to drive continuous improvement throughout our organization.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Utilizing TVS, we improve processes by identifying and accepting the need for change of current practices to reduce costs, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (comprised of team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.
916365_13_ITEM1_P32_S5	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
916365_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies.
916365_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our key management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a warehouse management system, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	We plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the continued roll-out of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers and an enhanced e-commerce platform, as well as store and support center hardware refreshes) in 2013.
916365_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	We will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support store and distribution center expansion.
916365_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	These efforts are directed toward constantly improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.
916365_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.5% .
916365_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	We plan to open 100 to 105 new stores in 2013 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8% .
916365_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	We opened 93 new stores in 2012 and 85 new stores in 2011 , selling square footage increases of approximately 8.1% and 7.8% , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	We operated 1,176 retail farm and ranch stores in 45 states as of December 29, 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 900 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	We lease approximately 93% of our store sites and own the remaining 7% of store sites.
916365_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	See further discussion of competition in 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	We are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner.
916365_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection and delivery of product knowledge to our customers.

916365_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our code of ethics, which applies to all of our team members, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, along with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of our Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, is posted on our website.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A prolonged or further weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as continued lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other competitors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us, could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We experience fluctuations in our same-store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been opened for at least twelve months.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Various factors affect same-store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	These factors may cause our same-store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Past same-store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our same-store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Capital requirements for growth may not be available.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our access to funds under our Senior Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $250 million , is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and, therefore, affect our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, other specialty retailers, independently owned farm and ranch stores, regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Weather conditions directly affect the demand for seasonal products in particular, especially during the winter heating season.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In past years, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in winter months, and extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the impact of weather conditions through geographic dispersion of our stores and taking advantage of our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather is likely to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	There is no assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers needs or expectations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Additionally, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, increased enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We receive certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, our online operations at TractorSupply.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	While we maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For example, unexpected delivery delays or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program through April 2015, we may discontinue this program at any time.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts' or investors' expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S5	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 29, 2012 , we operated 1,176 stores in 45 states.
916365_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We lease approximately 93% of our stores, two of our seven distribution centers and our management headquarters.
916365_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to our operations.
916365_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Following is a count of our store locations by state:
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines that were noncompliant, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Company notified these vendors of the EPA's position and has worked with these vendors to provide additional information to the DOJ and EPA regarding the alleged violations.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S4	As a result of this process, the Company believes it has provided evidence that many of the products identified by the DOJ and EPA in early 2011 were, in fact, in compliance with the Clean Air Act and that most of the remaining issues relate to products purchased from one vendor.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S5	The vendor of these products and the Company are engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ and EPA that would call for the payment of a civil penalty by and certain injunctive relief against the Company.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S6	In addition, the EPA in May 2012 provided the Company with a summary of preliminary findings based on inspections of certain products sold by the Company.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S7	In the fourth quarter of 2012, the EPA informed the Company of its position that many of the issues identified in its preliminary findings constitute violations of the Clean Air Act.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S8	The Company is working with the vendors of these products to provide additional information to EPA.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S9	The Company intends to seek reimbursement from its vendors for any penalties paid as part of a settlement of these matters.
916365_13_ITEM3_P0_S10	The Company does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	We do not believe it is reasonably possible that a loss in excess of the amount accrued will be incurred.
916365_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	We expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of January 31, 2013, the approximate number of record holders of our common stock was 549 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 64,000.
916365_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $1 billion, through April 2015.
916365_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	Share repurchase activity during fiscal 2012 is set forth in the table below:
916365_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC.
916365_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	Any additional share repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	During 2012 and 2011 , the Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
916365_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, and other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	On February 6, 2013 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_13_ITEM5_P9_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2013 .
916365_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_13_ITEM5_P11_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Common Stock from December 29, 2007 to December 29, 2012 (the Company's fiscal year-end) with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_13_ITEM5_P11_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 29, 2007 in our Common Stock and in each of the foregoing indices.
916365_13_ITEM5_P12_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
916365_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	(c) Same-store metrics are calculated on an annual basis, including relocations, using all stores open at least one year.
916365_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.
916365_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	(d) Assumes average inventory cost, excluding inventory in-transit.
916365_13_ITEM6_P4_S2	(e) Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company's capital lease obligations, excluding the current portion.
916365_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 29, 2012 (our fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010).
916365_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Fiscal year 2011 contains 53 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal years 2012 and 2010 which contain 52 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this report.
916365_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	As of December 29, 2012, we operated 1,176 retail stores in 45 states under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Feed Farm Supply.
916365_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	We also operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 764 stores at the end of 2007 to 1,176 stores at the end of fiscal 2012, and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.5% .
916365_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 900 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We opened 93 new stores in 2012 and 85 new stores in 2011 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.1% and 7.8% , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	During 2012, we opened our first stores in Colorado, and in 2013, we expect to continue our expansion into new markets, including Arizona.
916365_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2012, delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.80 versus $3.01 in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	As stated in the prior year, we estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2011 represented a benefit of approximately $0.09 per diluted share.
916365_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales increased to $4.66 billion in 2012, or 10.2% over the prior-year's 53-week period (11.6% adjusted for the extra sales week in fiscal 2011 as part of the Company's 53-week calendar).
916365_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Same-store sales increased 5.3%, driven primarily by continued strong results in key consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.
916365_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	As a percent of sales, gross margin improved to 33.6% from 33.2% in the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our gross margin rate continues to benefit from key margin-driving initiatives, including strategic sourcing, inventory and markdown management and price optimization.
916365_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We ended the year with $147 million in cash and restricted cash, after returning nearly $323 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes.
916365_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.9 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ("vendor support") and volume-based rebate funds ("volume rebates").
916365_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are "evergreen", reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility.
916365_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 29, 2012, net income would have been affected by approximately $0.8 million.
916365_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 29, 2012, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.6 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.
916365_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	While we believe we appropriately enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state.
916365_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.6 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve at December 29, 2012 would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2012 and 2011 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	(a) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	(b) Due to the 53-week fiscal 2011, each quarter of fiscal 2012 started one week later than the same quarter of fiscal 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The chart below presents same-store sales for 2011 as originally reported and as adjusted to represent the same 13-week period as the 2012 fiscal quarters.
916365_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The adjusted 13-week periods ended on April 2, 2011, July 2, 2011, October 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	The fiscal year ended December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks; the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks; and the fiscal year ended December 25, 2010 contained 52 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net sales increased 10.2% to $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012 from $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Fiscal 2012 included one less sales week compared to fiscal 2011 as a part of the Company's 53-week calendar in the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2011, our fiscal 2012 net sales increase was 11.6%.
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Same-store sales for fiscal 2012 were $4.39 billion , a 5.3% increase over fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	This compares to a 8.2% same-store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S5	The same-store transaction count increased 3.0% , while same-store average ticket increased 2.0% for fiscal 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S6	The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.
916365_13_ITEM7_P80_S7	We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories.
916365_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	In addition to same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 , sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $276.2 million in fiscal 2012 , which represented 6.5 percentage points of the 10.2% increase over fiscal 2011 net sales.
916365_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2012 and 2011 :
916365_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012 and 2011 :
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Gross margin increased 11.3% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.41 billion in 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 40 basis points to 33.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	These changes reflect improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and price optimization.
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	Transportation costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel costs, coupled with the continued mix shift to more freight-intensive C.U.E. products.
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S5	We expect transportation costs to continue to rise as a result of higher planned import volume as a percent of total purchases, as well as increased costs related to the continued mix shift to more freight-intensive C.U.E. products.
916365_13_ITEM7_P84_S6	However, we expect that we will be able to mitigate these factors through effective sourcing of product and retail price management.
916365_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 70 basis points to 24.2% in fiscal 2012 from 24.9% in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	This improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued strong same-store sales, expense control related to store operating costs and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2012 increased 7.1% to $1.13 billion from $1.05 billion in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth as well as operating costs relating to our new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center, which became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by the favorable impact of one less week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 , as part of the Company's 53-week calendar in the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our effective tax rate increased to 36.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The change in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the benefit provided by certain federal tax credits during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2012 increased 24.1% to $276.5 million , or $3.80 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $222.7 million , or $3.01 per diluted share, in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	During fiscal 2012 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of the Company's common stock at a total cost of $271.8 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.
916365_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	In fiscal 2011 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares at a total cost of $180.0 million .
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S4	The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S5	The same-store sales increase was driven by strong results in C.U.E. products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.
916365_13_ITEM7_P89_S6	Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast.
916365_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories.
916365_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points.
916365_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition to same-store sales growth in fiscal 2011, sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $237.5 million in fiscal 2011, which represented 6.4 percentage points of the 16.3% increase over fiscal 2010 net sales.
916365_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2011 and 2010 :
916365_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010:
916365_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	Direct product margin increased as we continued to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and price optimization.
916365_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	This change was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs.
916365_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system.
916365_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company s new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010.
916365_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.
916365_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	In fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million.
916365_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends.
916365_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facility, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	At December 29, 2012 , we had working capital of $569.5 million , which decreased $60.1 million from December 31, 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	This change was attributable to the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Working capital at December 29, 2012 was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash, inventory, accounts payable and income taxes payable.
916365_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to share repurchases and capital expenditures, offset in part by increased earnings.
916365_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	In fiscal 2012 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $271.8 million compared to approximately 3.1 million shares at a cost of $180.0 million in fiscal 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Capital expenditures of $152.9 million in fiscal 2012 reflect funding to support new store growth, distribution center capacity, technology upgrades to enhance our customer experience in our retail stores and on-line, as well as the purchase of an undeveloped parcel of land in Brentwood, Tennessee for our new store support center.
916365_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	We aggressively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth.
916365_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	Average inventory per store increased 0.6% compared to the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The increase in inventory levels on a per-store basis is primarily due to inflation.
916365_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth and the related higher inventory requirements, offset in part by the timing of vendor payments compared to the prior year.
916365_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sub-limits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swing-line loans, respectively).
916365_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016 , with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	At December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	There were $51.4 million and $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at December 29, 2012 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.21% at December 29, 2012 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio ( 0.50% at December 29, 2012 ).
916365_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, ( 0.10% at December 29, 2012 ).
916365_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	The leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.
916365_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and payment of common stock dividends.
916365_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity.
916365_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The $124.2 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 was primarily due to stronger earnings, working capital management and the timing of tax payments as shown below (in millions):
916365_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	The change in deferred income taxes is due primarily to temporary differences related to tax law changes regarding depreciation.
916365_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Inventory, net of accounts payable, increased at a lesser rate compared to prior year, as we achieved a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory primarily due to timing of payments.
916365_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	Income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets.
916365_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center.
916365_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments.
916365_13_ITEM7_P117_S3	The increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors.
916365_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Investing activities used cash of $139.1 million , $171.3 million and $112.1 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.
916365_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	In fiscal 2012 , the $152.9 million of capital expenditures was partially offset by a $13.5 million decrease in restricted cash.
916365_13_ITEM7_P118_S3	Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network and store support center expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions):
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	The above table reflects 93 new stores and one relocation during fiscal 2012 , compared to 85 new stores and three relocations during fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	We also purchased five of our existing leased stores during fiscal 2012 compared to 12 existing leased stores in fiscal 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	The capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 for distribution center capacity and improvements primarily reflect the construction of our new distribution center in Macon, Georgia, which we expect to be operational in late 2013.
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S3	The increase in expenditures for information technology in fiscal 2012 is related to point-of-sale system and e-commerce site upgrades, as well as store and store support center hardware refreshes.
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S4	The increase in corporate and other primarily reflects the purchase of an undeveloped parcel of land in Brentwood, Tennessee for our future store support center.
916365_13_ITEM7_P119_S5	The spending in fiscal 2011 for distribution center capacity is primarily due to the construction of our distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers.
916365_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $240 million and $250 million in fiscal 2013 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	We estimate that we will spend approximately $40 to $45 million in fiscal 2013 on our distribution center network, principally to relocate our southeast distribution center to Macon, Georgia, as well as continued improvements in existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems.
916365_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	We plan to spend approximately $45 to $50 million in fiscal 2013 to develop and construct our new store support center, which we expect to be completed by late 2014.
916365_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	We also plan to invest in information technology upgrades, including an upgrade of our e-commerce site, which will include the integration of order management, drop shipment, fulfillment and call center activities.
916365_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Financing activities used cash of $277.5 million, $163.2 million , and $26.0 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2012 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on options exercised.
916365_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $1.0 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015 .
916365_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_13_ITEM7_P125_S3	Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.
916365_13_ITEM7_P125_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	We repurchased approximately 3.1 million , 3.1 million and 0.8 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $271.8 million , $180.0 million and $38.2 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	As of December 29, 2012 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $291.2 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.20 per share.
916365_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	We paid dividends totaling $51.3 million , $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years.
916365_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2012 (in thousands):
916365_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	(a) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	(b) Relates to the obligation to purchase a previously leased store.
916365_13_ITEM7_P130_S2	(c) Reflects $3.1 million for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2013, $24.4 million for construction of our distribution center in Macon, Georgia, and $1.1 million for development of our new store support center.
916365_13_ITEM7_P130_S3	In addition, in January 2013 we signed a contract related to the construction of our new store support center in the amount of $59.0 million.
916365_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	At December 29, 2012 , there were $51.4 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $7.3 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash.
916365_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_13_ITEM7_P132_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.
916365_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.
916365_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
916365_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 31, 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P134_S4	There are no items of other comprehensive income for the periods presented; thus, there was no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S1	The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount ( qualitative assessment ).
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S2	If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test.
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S3	The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S4	The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 31, 2012.
916365_13_ITEM7_P135_S5	There was no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
916365_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ) or LIBOR ( 0.21% and 0.30% at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% ) based on our leverage ratio ( 0.50% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ).
916365_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% ) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line ( 0.10% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ).
916365_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	In past years, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts have also affected our sales and results of operations.
916365_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the impact of extreme weather conditions through geographic dispersion of our stores and taking advantage of our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation.
916365_13_ITEM7_P137_S3	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
916365_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 29, 2012 , the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company's consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
916365_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_13_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 , based on the COSO criteria .
916365_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2012 , and our report dated February 20, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
916365_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2012 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tractor Supply Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2013 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

916365_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Tractor Supply Company (the Company , we , us and/or our ) is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.
916365_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	We are focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	At December 29, 2012 , we operated a total of 1,176 retail farm and ranch stores in 45 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	The fiscal years ended December 29, 2012 and December 25, 2010 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Vendor Funding We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ("vendor support") and volume-based rebate funds ("volume rebates").
916365_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are "evergreen", reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Therefore, we estimate potential obligations based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	At December 29, 2012 , we had recorded net insurance reserves of $37.4 million compared to $31.2 million at December 31, 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_13_ITEM8_P34_S5	While we believe we appropriately enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, will not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state.
916365_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	In fiscal 2011 and 2010 , the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.5 million and $1.1 million , respectively, related to the write-off of certain assets, which were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.
916365_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	If we receive payment before completion of our customer obligations (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.
916365_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	At December 29, 2012 , we had a liability of $3.0 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	We recognize revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognize income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift card and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	We recognized breakage income of $1.2 million , $1.5 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers, from our distribution centers to our retail stores, and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio and other promotions.
916365_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were approximately $62.6 million , $56.0 million and $48.6 million , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.9 million and $0.3 million at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Distribution center costs for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were approximately $90.2 million , $76.8 million and $64.4 million , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores and distribution centers, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $7.1 million , $7.3 million and $7.1 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan, covering certain members of management and non-employee directors.
916365_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards.
916365_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	We rely on a blended volatility approach, weighting historical volatility trends and implied volatility, to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options.
916365_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	We adjust this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.
916365_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company s comprehensive income is equal to net income in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup ( Citigroup ), consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	At December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , the Company s restricted cash consisted of $8.4 million and $21.9 million , respectively, in time deposits held as collateral for a letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility for certain insurance policies.
916365_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_13_ITEM8_P76_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.
916365_13_ITEM8_P77_S2	We had no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	During 2011 and 2012, we entered into agreements with various governmental entities in the states of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee to implement tax abatement plans related to our distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County), our distribution center currently under construction in Macon, Georgia (Bibb County) and our new store support center currently under construction in Brentwood, Tennessee (Williamson County).
916365_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to our real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P83_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 29, 2012:
916365_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, we have not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	Computer software consists primarily of third-party software purchased for internal use.
916365_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_13_ITEM8_P86_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under the new authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
916365_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed.
916365_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_13_ITEM8_P89_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations.
916365_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under-performing.
916365_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	We record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.
916365_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.
916365_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ).
916365_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all stock options and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_13_ITEM8_P97_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the grant date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company's share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2012 .
916365_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	Share-based compensation expense including changes in expense for modifications of awards was $17.6 million , $15.0 million and $11.8 million for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
916365_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and other employees.
916365_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	Under the terms of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 6,200,000 shares are available for grant as stock options or other awards.
916365_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	At December 29, 2012 , we had 4,003,636 shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	We have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	of options granted during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	Prior to 2012, we used actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to determine volatility.
916365_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	Beginning in 2012, we use a blended volatility approach, weighting (i) actual historical changes in the market value of the stock at 75% and (ii) average implied volatility using tradable option data at 25% .
916365_13_ITEM8_P107_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, we use daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	To derive implied volatility, we rely on publicly traded options, with maturities of six months or greater.
916365_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	We believe this blended calculation of historical and expected price volatility provides the most relevant indicator of future volatility.
916365_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested.
916365_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_13_ITEM8_P112_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

916365_13_ITEM8_P160_S2	If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test.
916365_13_ITEM8_P160_S3	The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.

916365_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
916365_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Feed Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of farm and ranch products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	At December 28, 2013 , we operated 1,276 retail farm and ranch stores in 48 states.
916365_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 19,000 square feet of inside selling space along with additional outside selling space.
916365_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	We use a standard 15,500 square foot design for most new built-to-suit locations.
916365_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	In some smaller markets we use a 12,500 square foot format with slightly less inventory and lower occupancy costs than our prototype but with a similar product assortment.
916365_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	We believe our sales and earnings growth are the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:
916365_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Market Niche We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch and rural customers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Customers Our customers are home, land, pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living.
916365_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.

916365_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.
916365_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	Additionally, we maintain a customer solutions center located in Brentwood, Tennessee that can be reached via phone or email that supports our online and in-store customers and our store team members.
916365_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
916365_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.
916365_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.
916365_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Based on the third party provider s data, we consider our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.
916365_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	We critically evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.
916365_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Store Personnel and Training We seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.
916365_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.

916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.
916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.
916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.
916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.
916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S6	Our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience.
916365_14_ITEM1_P9_S7	Also, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.

916365_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2013 .

916365_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.
916365_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 :
916365_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our buying team constantly reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, edible (C.U.E.) products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Examples of C.U.E product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products, such as pest control and twine.
916365_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We purchase our products from a group of approximately 800 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2013 .
916365_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	Approximately 300 core vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2013 .
916365_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our buying team focuses on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs.
916365_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions, and a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning.
916365_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to improve our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
916365_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Intellectual Property Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP ( TSCT ), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) for various service marks including TSC , Tractor Supply Co. , TSC Tractor Supply Co. and the trapezium design for retail store services.
916365_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business.
916365_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.
916365_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.
916365_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.
916365_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our exclusive brands represented approximately 31% , 25% and 23% of our total sales in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	The exclusive brands identified above have been registered with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.
916365_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, copyrights and patents, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Distribution We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2013 our stores received approximately 71% of merchandise through this network while approximately 29% of merchandise was shipped directly to the stores from our vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance sales and improve our inventory turnover rate.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our seven distribution centers, located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of 3.9 million square feet.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	In 2013 , we completed construction on a new distribution center, a 684,000 square foot facility in Macon, Georgia, which includes an import center.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	It replaced our 521,000 square foot leased distribution center in Braselton, Georgia and became operational in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S5	We continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers, and currently four of our seven facilities utilize a new warehouse management system that provides for better movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation.
916365_14_ITEM1_P23_S6	We will continue to refine this new system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations.
916365_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores.
916365_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.
916365_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Marketing We utilize an "everyday value price" philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
916365_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.
916365_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings.
916365_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.
916365_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.
916365_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Multi-Channel We communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website ( TractorSupply.com ), email and direct mail.
916365_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.
916365_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Additionally, in 2013, we upgraded our e-commerce website to include the integration of order management, added extensive products offerings for vendor direct to customer drop shipments and transitioned to in-house warehouse fulfillment for products that we stock.
916365_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Management and Team Members As of December 28, 2013 , we employed approximately 10,200 full-time and 9,000 part-time team members.
916365_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our store operations are organized into eight regions.
916365_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Each region is led by a vice president of operations, and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.
916365_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) retirement savings plan solely through a cash match of 100% of the employee s elective contributions up to 3% of eligible compensation plus 50% of the employee s elective contributions from 3% to 6% of eligible compensation).
916365_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high-potential team members for continued progress.
916365_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our current team of district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years.
916365_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Continuous Improvement We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ), which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Utilizing TVS, we improve processes by identifying and accepting the need for change of current practices to reduce costs, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S4	Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.
916365_14_ITEM1_P34_S5	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
916365_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies.
916365_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	system, a warehouse management system, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	We plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the continued roll-out of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers, significant feature enhancements to our e-commerce platform, an enhanced demand planning system and store and support center hardware refreshes) in 2014 .
916365_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	We will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support store and distribution center expansion.
916365_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	These efforts are directed toward improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.
916365_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via e-commerce and internet-supported sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.4% .
916365_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	We plan to open 102 to 106 new stores in 2014 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8% .
916365_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	We opened 102 new stores in 2013 and 93 new stores in 2012 , selling square footage increases of approximately 8.3% and 7.9% , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	We operated 1,276 retail farm and ranch stores in 48 states as of December 28, 2013 .
916365_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	Approximately 56% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 44% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	We lease approximately 93% of our store sites and own the remaining 7% of store sites.
916365_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	See further discussion of competition in 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	In past years, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in winter months, and extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively.
916365_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our strategy is to remain flexible and react to extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions.
916365_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	We are committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner.
916365_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	This commitment impacts all areas of our business, including investments in store construction and maintenance, energy usage, supply chain, product selection, responsible packaging, recycling, and delivery of product knowledge to our customers.
916365_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 1, 2014 .

916365_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other competitors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us, could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Capital requirements for growth may not be available.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our access to funds under our Senior Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $250 million with an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments), is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, other specialty retailers, internet retailers, independently owned farm and ranch stores, regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In past years, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in winter months, and extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have affected our sales and results of operations both positively and negatively.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our strategy is to remain flexible and to react to extreme weather conditions by adjusting our merchandise assortments and redirecting inventories to stores affected by the weather conditions.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends, consumer preferences and expectations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are be subject to personal injury, workers' compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers' compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of adoption of new, changes in, or increased enforcement of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We receive certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, our online operations at TractorSupply.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	While we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As customer-facing technologies systems become an increasingly important part of our multi-channel sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program through April 2015, we may discontinue this program at any time.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts' or investors' expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company's stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	That multiple is in part dependent on investors' perception of the Company's future earnings growth prospects.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If investor perceptions of the Company's earnings growth prospects change, the Company's earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S5	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our success depends on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.
916365_14_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.
916365_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 28, 2013 , the Company operated 1,276 stores in 48 states.
916365_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company leases approximately 93% of its stores, one of its seven distribution centers and three store support center locations in Brentwood, Tennessee.
916365_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to Company operations.
916365_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Following is a count of store locations by state:
916365_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	Following is a list of distribution center locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines that were noncompliant, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Company notified these vendors of the EPA's position and has worked with these vendors to provide additional information to the DOJ and EPA regarding the alleged violations.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	As a result of this process, the Company believes it has provided evidence that many of the products identified by the DOJ and EPA in early 2011 were, in fact, in compliance with the Clean Air Act and that most of the remaining issues relate to products purchased from one vendor.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S5	The vendor of these products and the Company are engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ and EPA that would call for the payment of a civil penalty by and certain injunctive relief against the Company.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S6	The Company does not expect the resolution of this matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_14_ITEM3_P0_S7	The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that a loss in excess of the amount accrued will be incurred.
916365_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company is also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company believes that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	Accordingly, the Company currently expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	On August 28, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
916365_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	On September 26, 2013, stockholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2013, received one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.
916365_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	All share and per-share information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split.
916365_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of January 31, 2014, the approximate number of record holders of our common stock was 800 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 82,000.
916365_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	During 2013 and 2012 , the Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:
916365_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	(a) All dividend amounts except the October 30, 2013 dividend amount have been split adjusted.
916365_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, and other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	On February 5, 2014 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 11, 2014 , to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 24, 2014 .
916365_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $1 billion, through April 2015.
916365_14_ITEM5_P8_S1	Additionally, the Company withholds shares from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees' minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_14_ITEM5_P8_S2	Stock purchase activity during fiscal 2013 is set forth in the table below:
916365_14_ITEM5_P9_S0	(a) The number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share shown in the table above have been adjusted to reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split that was effective September 26, 2013.
916365_14_ITEM5_P9_S1	(b) The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include 76,246 shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_14_ITEM5_P9_S2	(c) The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include 2,697 shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_14_ITEM5_P10_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.
916365_14_ITEM5_P11_S0	The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_14_ITEM5_P12_S0	Any additional stock repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_14_ITEM5_P12_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_14_ITEM5_P13_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_14_ITEM5_P14_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Common Stock from December 27, 2008 to December 28, 2013 (the Company's fiscal year-end) with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_14_ITEM5_P14_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 27, 2008 in our Common Stock and in each of the foregoing indices and in each case assumes reinvestment of dividends.
916365_14_ITEM5_P15_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
916365_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_14_ITEM6_P3_S2	(c) Adjusted to reflect two-for-one stock split that was effective September 26, 2013.
916365_14_ITEM6_P3_S3	(d) Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis, including relocations, using all stores open at least one year.
916365_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.

916365_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	(f) Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company's capital lease obligations, excluding the current portion.
916365_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 28, 2013 (our fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 ).
916365_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2013 and 2012 contained 52 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal year 2011 which contained 53 weeks.
916365_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this report.

916365_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via e-commerce and internet-supported sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 855 stores at the end of 2008 to 1,276 stores at the end of fiscal 2013 , and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.4% .
916365_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	On August 28, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
916365_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	On September 26, 2013, stockholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2013, received one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.
916365_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	All share and per-share information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split.
916365_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	The total number of authorized common shares and the par value of each share was not changed by the split.
916365_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	We opened 102 new stores in 2013 and 93 new stores in 2012 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.3% and 7.9% , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	During 2013 , we opened stores in 34 states, including our first stores in Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming, and in 2014 we expect to continue our expansion into these new markets.
916365_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013 , delivering diluted earnings per share growth of 22.1%, $2.32 versus $1.90 in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales increased 10.7% to $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013 from $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in fiscal 2013 versus a 5.3% increase in fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	in fiscal 2012, and gross margin increased 40 basis points to 34.0% of sales in fiscal 2013 from 33.6% of sales in fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Operating profit increased 60 basis points to 10.0% of sales in fiscal 2013 from 9.4% of sales in fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	In fiscal 2013, diluted earnings per share grew 22.1%, to $2.32 compared to $1.90 in fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We ended the year with approximately $143 million in cash, after returning nearly $198 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 28, 2013, would have affected net income by approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes.
916365_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 28, 2013, would have affected net income by approximately $1.0 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ("vendor support") and volume-based rebate funds ("volume rebates").
916365_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are "evergreen", reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility.
916365_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 28, 2013, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 28, 2013, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.9 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 28, 2013, would have affected net income by approximately $2.6 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	While we believe we appropriately enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state.
916365_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 28, 2013, would have affected net income by approximately $0.6 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve at December 28, 2013 would have affected net income by approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2013.
916365_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2013 and 2012 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	(a) Due to the nature of interim net income per share calculations, the sum of quarterly net income per share amounts may not equal the reported net income per share for the year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	All net income per share amounts except the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 have been split adjusted.
916365_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	The fiscal years ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks.
916365_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others (like the Company) exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net sales increased 10.7% to $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013 from $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 were $4.89 billion , a 4.8% increase over fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	This compares to a 5.3% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 4.7% , while comparable store average ticket remained flat for fiscal 2013 , principally as a result of big ticket sales being less of the sales mix.
916365_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in net sales of stores open at least one year and exclude certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key consumable, usable, edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	This was a result of continued investment in C.U.E. inventory, expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings.
916365_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	Winter seasonal merchandise, predominantly heating and insulated outerwear, also performed well during the first part of the year and the end of the year due to the colder than average weather.
916365_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	We also estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 70 basis points due to inflation, principally in pet food and livestock feed.
916365_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2013 , sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $281.2 million in fiscal 2013 , which represented 6.0 percentage points of the 10.7% increase over fiscal 2012 net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $276.2 million in fiscal 2012 , which represented 6.5 percentage points of the 10.2% increase over fiscal 2011 net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2013 and 2012 :
916365_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013 and 2012 :
916365_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Gross profit increased 12.0% to $1.75 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 40 basis points to 34.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	This improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin.
916365_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of continued progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 20 basis points to 24.0% in fiscal 2013 from 24.2% in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued solid comparable store sales growth, expense control related to store operating costs and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense, partially offset by costs related to the new and expanded Southeast distribution center and relocation of our corporate data center.
916365_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 9.7% to $1.24 billion from $1.13 billion in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth as well as operating costs relating to our new and expanded Southeast distribution center and corporate data center.
916365_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.2% for fiscal 2013 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	The reduction in the tax rate resulted primarily from the favorable impact of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2013 increased 18.7% to $328.2 million , or $2.32 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $276.5 million , or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of the Company's common stock at a total cost of $129.4 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.
916365_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	In fiscal 2012 , we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares at a total cost of $271.8 million .
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Net sales increased 10.2% to $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012 from $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Fiscal 2012 included one less sales week compared to fiscal 2011 as a part of the Company's 53-week calendar in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2011, our fiscal 2012 net sales increase was 11.6%.
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 were $4.39 billion, a 5.3% increase over fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	This compares to an 8.2% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P91_S5	The comparable store transaction count increased 3.0%, while comparable store average ticket increased 2.0% for fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in C.U.E. products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.
916365_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	We estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories.
916365_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2012, sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $276.2 million in fiscal 2012, which represented 6.5 percentage points of the 10.2% increase over fiscal 2011 net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $237.5 million in fiscal 2011, which represented 6.4 percentage points of the 16.3% increase over fiscal 2010 net sales.
916365_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2012 and 2011 :
916365_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012 and 2011 :
916365_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Gross profit increased 11.3% to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.41 billion in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 40 basis points to 33.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	These changes reflect improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs.
916365_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Direct product margin increased as we continued to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and price optimization.
916365_14_ITEM7_P96_S4	Transportation costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel costs, coupled with the continued mix shift to more freight-intensive C.U.E. products.
916365_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 70 basis points to 24.2% in fiscal 2012 from 24.9% in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	This improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued strong comparable store sales, expense control related to store operating costs and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2012 increased 7.1% to $1.13 billion from $1.05 billion in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth as well as operating costs relating to our Franklin, Kentucky distribution center, which became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by the favorable impact of one less week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, as part of the Company's 53-week calendar in the prior year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our effective tax rate increased to 36.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	The change in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the benefit provided by certain federal tax credits during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2012 increased 24.1% to $276.5 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $222.7 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2011.
916365_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	During fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of the Company's common stock at a total cost of $271.8 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.
916365_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	In fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares at a total cost of $180.0 million.
916365_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, share repurchases and cash dividends.
916365_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facility, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	At December 28, 2013 , the Company had working capital of $677.1 million , which increased $107.6 million from December 29, 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	In comparison to December 29, 2012, working capital as of December 28, 2013 was impacted most significantly by changes in our inventory and income taxes payable.
916365_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth.
916365_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	Average inventory per store decreased 0.5% compared to the prior year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	The timing of receipt of seasonal goods was much earlier in the fourth quarter in the current year and imports made up a larger percentage of fourth quarter receipts, requiring payment on trade credit prior to year end.
916365_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	These factors drove the decline in accounts payable.
916365_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Income taxes payable decreased due to timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with a sub-limit of $20 million for swing-line loans).
916365_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Senior Credit Facility has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).
916365_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016 , with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	At December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	There were $38.2 million and $51.4 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at December 28, 2013 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.16% at December 28, 2013 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum ( 0.50% at December 28, 2013 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum ( 0.10% at December 28, 2013 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	The leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_14_ITEM7_P110_S3	The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_14_ITEM7_P110_S4	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2013 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.
916365_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.
916365_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Operating activities provided net cash of $333.7 million , $378.3 million and $254.1 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	The $44.6 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	The $44.6 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 primarily relates to increased inventory levels, a reduction in accounts payable and timing of estimated tax payments, partially offset by an increase in net earnings.
916365_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	Inventory increased in proportion to store growth as expected, but the accounts payable balance declined year over year.
916365_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	The timing of receipt of seasonal goods was much earlier in the fourth quarter in the current year and imports made up a larger percentage of fourth quarter receipts, requiring payment on trade credit prior to year end.
916365_14_ITEM7_P113_S3	These factors drove the decline in accounts payable.
916365_14_ITEM7_P113_S4	Income taxes payable declined due to the timing of estimated tax payments resulting from changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	The $124.2 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	The change in deferred income taxes is due primarily to temporary differences related to tax law changes regarding depreciation.
916365_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Inventory, net of accounts payable, increased at a lesser rate compared to prior year, as we achieved a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory primarily due to timing of payments.
916365_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Investing activities used cash of $209.3 million , $139.1 million and $171.3 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	The increase in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures slightly offset by a reduction in restricted cash.
916365_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	The decrease in restricted cash during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 related to less cash required as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in millions):
916365_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	The above table reflects 102 new stores and three relocations during fiscal 2013 , compared to 93 new stores and one relocation during fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	We purchased three of our existing leased stores during fiscal 2013 compared to five existing leased stores in fiscal 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	The capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 for distribution center capacity and improvements relate primarily to the construction of our new Macon, Georgia distribution center, which is the relocation of our former Southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia.
916365_14_ITEM7_P118_S3	The increase in corporate and other primarily reflects the construction of our new store support center in Brentwood, Tennessee.
916365_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $240 million and $250 million in fiscal 2014 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	We plan to invest in our distribution center network in fiscal 2014 , principally for development of a new Southwest distribution center and the ongoing rollout of a new warehouse management system in our distribution centers.
916365_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	We plan to finish construction of our new store support center, which we expect to be completed by end of third quarter 2014 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	We also plan to invest in information technology upgrades at our stores and store support center which will include additional multi-channel capabilities, improved inventory allocation and price optimization and continued improvements in data security.
916365_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	Financing activities used cash of $120.3 million, $277.5 million, and $163.2 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on options exercised.
916365_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	The reduction in net cash used in financing activities is largely due to $142.4 million less in common stock repurchases in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
916365_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Our Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $1 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015 .
916365_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_14_ITEM7_P124_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_14_ITEM7_P124_S3	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_14_ITEM7_P124_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	We repurchased approximately 2.3 million , 6.1 million and 6.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $129.4 million , $271.8 million and $180.0 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	As of December 28, 2013 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $161.8 million , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.13 per share and, in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.10 per share.
916365_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	We paid dividends totaling $68.5 million , $51.3 million and $30.9 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, new store support center and distribution center capacity, through the end of fiscal 2014.
916365_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 28, 2013 (in thousands):
916365_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	(a) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	(b) Reflects $6.0 million for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2014, and $22.0 million for the construction of our new store support center.
916365_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	At December 28, 2013 , there were $38.2 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and an $18.3 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	Effective April 1, 2013, the outstanding letter of credit at the financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility increased from $8.4 million to $18.3 million, and the restriction on $8.4 million in restricted cash lapsed.
916365_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.
916365_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at both December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 ) or LIBOR ( 0.16% and 0.21% at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 , respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum ( 0.50% at both December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We are also required to pay quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum ( 0.10% at both December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992 framework).
916365_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 28, 2013 , the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company's consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_14_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_14_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

916365_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 28, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

916365_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Tractor Supply Company (the Company ) is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.
916365_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_14_ITEM8_P22_S3	At December 28, 2013 , the Company operated a total of 1,276 retail farm and ranch stores in 48 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company's fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	The fiscal years ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks.
916365_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The presentation of non-cash accruals for construction in progress on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was changed to conform to the presentation used in the current period.
916365_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	On August 28, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two -for-one split of its outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
916365_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	On September 26, 2013, stockholders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2013, received one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.
916365_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	All share and per-share information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split.
916365_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	The total number of authorized common shares and the par value of each share was not changed by the split.
916365_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on the Company's aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Shrinkage The Company performs physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and the Company has established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Vendor Funding The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ("vendor support") and volume-based rebate funds ("volume rebates").
916365_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are "evergreen", reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Certain of the Company's agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on the Company's current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ from previously estimated amounts.
916365_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Freight The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.
916365_14_ITEM8_P36_S5	At December 28, 2013 , the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of $41.3 million compared to $37.4 million at December 29, 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of the Company's sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company's compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S3	The business activities of the Company's customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company's sales tax compliance.
916365_14_ITEM8_P37_S5	While the Company believes it appropriately enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that upon final completion of such audits, the Company will not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.
916365_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.
916365_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Tax Contingencies The Company's income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company's tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company's various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S4	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S5	The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_14_ITEM8_P46_S6	If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2013 and 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	In fiscal 2011 , the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.5 million related to the write-off of certain assets which were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.
916365_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company's special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.
916365_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	At December 28, 2013 , the Company had a liability of $3.1 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.0 million at December 29, 2012 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company recognized breakage income of $1.6 million , $1.2 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution centers, from distribution centers to retail stores, and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio and other promotions.
916365_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were approximately $65.6 million , $62.6 million and $56.0 million , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.9 million at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Costs incurred at the Company's distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	Distribution center costs for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were approximately $111.3 million , $90.2 million and $76.8 million , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $7.8 million , $7.1 million and $7.3 million in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
916365_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	In addition, the Company offers an employee stock purchase plan to most employees that work at least 20 hours per week.
916365_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company's stock option awards.
916365_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company relies on a blended volatility approach, weighting historical volatility trends and implied volatility, to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_14_ITEM8_P62_S3	The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company's historical experience for similar options.
916365_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	The fair value of the Company's restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company's common stock the day preceding the grant date.
916365_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.
916365_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Dilutive shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company s comprehensive income is equal to net income in fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Sales generated through the Company's private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup ( Citigroup ), consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.

916365_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.

916365_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_14_ITEM8_P86_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_14_ITEM8_P86_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 28, 2013 :
916365_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.

916365_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.
916365_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_14_ITEM8_P94_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_14_ITEM8_P94_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to the Company's operations.
916365_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.
916365_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.

916365_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company's normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.
916365_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.

916365_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company's share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2013 .

916365_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM8_P108_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	Prior to 2012, the Company used actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to determine volatility.
916365_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	Beginning in 2012, the Company uses a blended volatility approach, weighting (i) actual historical changes in the market value of the stock at 75% and (ii) average implied volatility using tradable option data at 25% .
916365_14_ITEM8_P110_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	To derive implied volatility, the Company relies on publicly traded options, with maturities of six months or greater.
916365_14_ITEM8_P111_S1	The Company believes this blended calculation of historical and expected price volatility provides the most relevant indicator of future volatility.
916365_14_ITEM8_P111_S2	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_14_ITEM8_P113_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_14_ITEM8_P113_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested.
916365_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_14_ITEM8_P114_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.

916365_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.
916365_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.
916365_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.
916365_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our exclusive brands represented approximately 31% of our total sales in fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 25% of our total sales in fiscal 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	The exclusive brands identified above have been registered with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.
916365_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.
916365_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.
916365_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Distribution We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2014 our stores received approximately 70% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors.
916365_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate.
916365_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our seven distribution centers, located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of 4.2 million square feet.
916365_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	In late 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for a second facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, with a capacity of 309,000 square feet.
916365_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	This additional space will support the future growth of stores in the northeast.
916365_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, with a capacity of approximately 650,000 square feet.
916365_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	This facility will support our western store expansion and is expected to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2015.
916365_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	We continue to improve the technology in our distribution centers, and currently four of our seven facilities utilize a warehouse management system that provides for improved movement of inventory through increased use of conveyors and automation.
916365_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	We will continue to refine this system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations.
916365_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We select the locations of our distribution centers in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution centers to our stores.
916365_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.
916365_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Marketing We utilize an everyday value price philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
916365_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and internet offerings.
916365_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons.
916365_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.
916365_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Omni-Channel We communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website ( TractorSupply.com ), email and direct mail.
916365_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.
916365_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	We maintain a fulfillment center within our Franklin, Kentucky distribution center to support our e-commerce activities.
916365_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Additionally in 2014, we continued to invest in our omni-channel platform and expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options, product information and site research.
916365_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	We also introduced an optimized mobile and tablet experience, improved the site response time and added additional product offerings for vendor direct to customer drop shipments.
916365_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	HomeTown Pet We opened two HomeTown Pet stores in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	HomeTown Pet is a new pet supply store that provides high-quality products, knowledge and service to pet owners.
916365_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	The stores offer products for a wide variety of pets and animals, including cats, dogs, poultry, birds and horses as well as grooming and mobile vet services.
916365_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	We are a test-and-learn company, and we believe these stores will help us gain better insight into the pet and animal supply category and provide valuable information that can help us better understand the unique needs of our pet customers.
916365_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Management and Team Members As of December 27, 2014 , we employed approximately 11,000 full-time and 10,100 part-time team members.
916365_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our store operations are organized into seven regions.
916365_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Each region is led by a vice president of operations, and the region is further organized into districts, each of which is led by a district manager.
916365_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have two internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition to bonus incentive programs, we also provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan.
916365_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility.
916365_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years.
916365_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Continuous Improvement We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ), which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Through TVS, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S4	Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.
916365_15_ITEM1_P36_S5	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
916365_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support on-line operations.
916365_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our key management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a warehouse management system, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	We plan to continue to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements.
916365_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	We continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store, distribution center and omni-channel expansion.
916365_15_ITEM1_P38_S4	These efforts are directed toward improving business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.
916365_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday value price philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via e-commerce and internet-supported sales by improving our website product content and enhancing the online experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.2% .
916365_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	We plan to open 110 to 115 new stores in 2015 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8% .
916365_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	We opened 107 new stores in 2014 and 102 new stores in 2013 , which represents selling square footage increases of approximately 8.3% during both fiscal 2014 and 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	At December 27, 2014 , we operated 1,382 retail stores in 49 states.
916365_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 700 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	Approximately 56% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 44% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	We lease approximately 93% of our stores and own the remaining 7% .
916365_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	See further discussion of competition in 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.
916365_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S5	These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, high efficiency lighting and heating/air conditioning systems in our stores, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution centers and the Store Support Center.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S6	In 2014, our new Store Support Center was awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification for its environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation.
916365_15_ITEM1_P47_S7	We also installed solar arrays at the new Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee and our store in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

916365_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us, could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Capital required for growth may not be available.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The construction or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, the remodeling and renovation of existing stores and investments in information technology, require significant amounts of capital.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the past, our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our access to funds under our Senior Credit Facility, which provides for borrowings of up to $400 million , is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, tight lending practices may make it challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet or exceed our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, other specialty retailers, internet retailers, independently owned farm and ranch stores, regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	internationally, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers or landlords indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We receive certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, our online operations at TractorSupply.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	While we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omni-channel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Omni-channel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution centers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $2 billion through December 2017, we may discontinue this program at any time.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	That multiple is in part dependent on investors perception of the Company s future earnings growth prospects.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If investor perceptions of the Company s earnings growth prospects change, the Company s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) as well as state and local taxing authorities.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.
916365_15_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.
916365_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 27, 2014 , the Company operated 1,382 stores in 49 states.
916365_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company leases approximately 93% of its stores, two distribution sites and its Merchandising Innovation Center (planogram) located in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to Company operations.
916365_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Following is a count of store locations by state:
916365_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	(a) Includes the Company s two HomeTown Pet stores.
916365_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	Following is a list of distribution center locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:
916365_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	(a) The leased facility in Hagerstown is treated as an extension of the existing owned Hagerstown location and is not considered a separate distribution center.
916365_15_ITEM2_P5_S0	In addition, our eighth distribution center is under construction in Casa Grande, Arizona.
916365_15_ITEM2_P5_S1	This owned facility will be approximately 650,000 square feet, and it is expected to be fully operational by the fourth quarter of 2015.
916365_15_ITEM2_P6_S0	The Company s Store Support Center occupies approximately 260,000 square feet of owned building space in Brentwood, Tennessee, and the Company s Merchandising Innovation Center occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of leased building space in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines that were noncompliant, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Company notified these vendors of the EPA s position and worked with these vendors to provide additional information to the DOJ and EPA regarding the alleged violations.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S4	As a result of this process, the Company believes it has provided evidence that many of the products identified by the DOJ and EPA in early 2011 were, in fact, in compliance with the Clean Air Act and that most of the remaining issues relate to products purchased from one vendor.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S5	The vendor of these products and the Company are engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ and EPA that would call for the payment of a civil penalty by, and certain injunctive relief against, the Company.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S6	The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_15_ITEM3_P0_S7	The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that a loss in excess of the amount accrued will be incurred.
916365_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company is also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company believes that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	Accordingly, the Company currently expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

916365_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
916365_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 27, 2014 , we operated 1,382 retail stores in 49 states under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del s Feed Farm Supply and HomeTown Pet.
916365_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	We also operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.
916365_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday value price philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via e-commerce and internet-supported sales by improving our website product content and enhancing the online experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 930 stores at the end of 2009 to 1,382 stores at the end of fiscal 2014 , and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.2% .
916365_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 700 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We opened 107 new stores in 2014 and 102 new stores in 2013 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.3% in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	During 2014 , we opened stores in 31 states, including our first store in Utah, and in 2015 we expect to continue our expansion into the western states.
916365_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales increased 10.6% to $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014 from $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Comparable store sales increased 3.8% in fiscal 2014 versus a 4.8% increase in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Gross profit increased 11.2% to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014 from $1.75 billion in fiscal 2013 , and gross margin increased 10 basis points to 34.1% of sales in fiscal 2014 from 34.0% of sales in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Operating profit increased 30 basis points to 10.3% of sales in fiscal 2014 from 10.0% of sales in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	In fiscal 2014 , diluted earnings per share grew 14.7% , to $2.66 compared to $2.32 in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We ended the year with $51.1 million in cash, after returning $382.6 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 27, 2014, would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 27, 2014, would have affected net income by approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility.
916365_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 27, 2014, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 27, 2014, net income would have been affected by approximately $5.7 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Provisions for losses related to our self-insured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 27, 2014, would have affected net income by approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	When establishing our sales tax audit reserve, we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk as well as our historical experience with each respective state.
916365_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 27, 2014, would have affected net income by approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve at December 27, 2014 would have affected net income by approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2014 and 2013 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	(a) Due to the nature of interim net income per share calculations, the sum of quarterly net income per share amounts may not equal the reported net income per share for the year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others (like our Company) exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net sales increased 10.6% to $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014 from $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 were $5.37 billion , a 3.8% increase over fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	This compares to a 4.8% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 3.2% , while comparable store average ticket increased 0.6% for fiscal 2014 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Comparable store sales are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Stores closed or relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store sales metrics calculations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	If the effect of closed and/or relocated stores on our comparable store sales metrics calculations becomes material, we would remove closed and/or relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key consumable, usable, edible ( C.U.E. ) products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise, and an increase in traffic counts.
916365_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	This was a result of continued investment in C.U.E. inventory, expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings.
916365_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Seasonal merchandise, predominantly heating and outdoor power equipment, performed well during the year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	We also estimate that comparable store sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 85 basis points due to deflation, principally in livestock feed and bird feeding products.
916365_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2014 , sales from stores opened less than one year were $353.4 million in fiscal 2014 , which represented 6.8 percentage points of the 10.6% increase over fiscal 2013 net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $281.2 million in fiscal 2013 , which represented 6.0 percentage points of the 10.7% increase over fiscal 2012 net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2014 and 2013 :
916365_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	(a) Includes the Company s two HomeTown Pet stores.
916365_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2014 and 2013 :
916365_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Gross profit increased 11.2% to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $1.75 billion in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 34.1% for fiscal 2014 compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	This improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by higher transportation costs, primarily due to our continued western store expansion.
916365_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of continued focus on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 20 basis points to 23.8% in fiscal 2014 from 24.0% in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of comparable store sales growth and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2014 increased 9.8% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth.
916365_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our effective tax rate increased to 36.9% for fiscal 2014 compared to 36.2% in fiscal 2013 as the prior year was favorably impacted by the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2014 increased 13.0% to $370.9 million , or $2.66 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $328.2 million , or $2.32 per diluted share, in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	During fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $298.5 million as part of our previously announced $2 billion share repurchase program.
916365_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	In fiscal 2013 , we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $129.4 million .
916365_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Net sales increased 10.7% to $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013 from $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 were $4.89 billion, a 4.8% increase over fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	This compares to a 5.3% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 4.7%, while comparable store average ticket remained flat for fiscal 2013, principally as a result of big ticket sales being less of the sales mix.
916365_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key C.U.E. products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	This was a result of continued investment in C.U.E inventory, expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings.
916365_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Winter seasonal merchandise, predominantly heating and insulated outerwear, also performed well during the first part of fiscal 2013 and the end of fiscal 2013 due to the colder than average weather.
916365_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	We also estimate that comparable store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 70 basis points due to inflation, principally in pet food and livestock feed.
916365_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2013, sales from stores opened less than one year were $281.2 million in fiscal 2013, which represented 6.0 percentage points of the 10.7% increase over fiscal 2012 net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $276.2 million in fiscal 2012, which represented 6.5 percentage points of the 10.2% increase over fiscal 2011 net sales.
916365_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2013 and 2012 :
916365_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2013 and 2012 :
916365_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Gross profit increased 12.0% to $1.75 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 40 basis points to 34.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	This improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin.
916365_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of continued progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 20 basis points to 24.0% in fiscal 2013 from 24.2% in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued solid comparable store sales growth, expense control related to store operating costs and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense, partially offset by costs related to the new and expanded Southeast distribution center and relocation of our corporate data center.
916365_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Total SG A expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 9.7% to $1.24 billion from $1.13 billion in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth as well as operating costs relating to our new and expanded Southeast distribution center and corporate data center.
916365_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.2% for fiscal 2013 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The reduction in the tax rate resulted primarily from the favorable impact of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2013 increased 18.7% to $328.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $276.5 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2012.
916365_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $129.4 million as part of our previously announced $2 billion share repurchase program.
916365_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	In fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares at a total cost of $271.8 million.
916365_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution center and Store Support Center capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, share repurchases and cash dividends.
916365_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facility, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	At December 27, 2014 , the Company had working capital of $670.9 million , which decreased $6.2 million from December 28, 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	In comparison to December 28, 2013 , working capital as of December 27, 2014 was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash, inventory and accounts payable.
916365_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to incremental common stock repurchases offset in part by earnings from operations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	Common stock repurchases increased $169.1 million from $129.4 million in fiscal 2013 to $298.5 million in fiscal 2014.
916365_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth.
916365_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	Average inventory per store increased 4.0% compared to the prior year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	The increase in average inventory per store is principally related to a better in-stock position on key winter goods compared to prior year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth and higher average inventory per store along with timing of payments to vendors.
916365_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	On May 16, 2014, the Company exercised the option to increase the availability under the Senior Credit Facility by $150 million, which increased the aggregate principle amount available thereunder from $250 million to $400 million .
916365_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	The sublimit for swingline loans was also increased from $20 million to $30 million .
916365_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016 , with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.
916365_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	At December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	There were $40.7 million and $38.2 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at December 27, 2014 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.17% at December 27, 2014 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum ( 0.50% at December 27, 2014 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum ( 0.10% at December 27, 2014 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	The leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_15_ITEM7_P107_S3	The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_15_ITEM7_P107_S4	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 27, 2014 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.
916365_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Operating activities provided net cash of $409.2 million , $333.7 million and $378.3 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	The $75.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	The $75.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflects earnings growth, the favorable impacts related to the timing of tax benefits and income tax payments, and increased depreciation and amortization expense due to capital expenditures for store growth, distribution center capacity and corporate infrastructure.
916365_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	The $44.6 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	The $44.6 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 primarily related to increased inventory levels, a reduction in accounts payable and timing of estimated tax payments, partially offset by an increase in net earnings.
916365_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	Inventory increased in proportion to store growth as expected, but the accounts payable balance declined year over year.
916365_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	The timing of receipt of seasonal goods was much earlier in the fourth quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 and imports made up a larger percentage of fourth quarter receipts, requiring payment on trade credit prior to year end.
916365_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	These factors drove the decline in accounts payable.
916365_15_ITEM7_P112_S4	Income taxes payable declined due to the timing of estimated tax payments resulting from changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense.
916365_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Investing activities used cash of $160.3 million , $209.3 million and $139.1 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	The changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects changes in capital expenditures.
916365_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in millions):
916365_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	The above table reflects 107 new stores and two relocations during fiscal 2014 , 102 new stores and three relocations during fiscal 2013 and 93 new stores and one relocation during fiscal 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	The majority of the corporate and other category for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 relates to construction of our new Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee with the greatest portion of the spend in fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P114_S2	The higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 for distribution center capacity and improvements was primarily due to construction of our Macon, Georgia distribution center, which was the relocation of our former leased Southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia.
916365_15_ITEM7_P114_S3	We did not purchase any leased stores during fiscal 2014 compared to having purchased three leased stores in fiscal 2013 and five leased stores in fiscal 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $240 million and $250 million in fiscal 2015 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	We plan to open between 110 to 115 stores in fiscal 2015 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Additionally, we plan to relocate five stores as well as increase our investment in existing store renovations.
916365_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	We plan to invest in our distribution center network in fiscal 2015 , principally for development of a new Southwest distribution center, expansion of our existing Northeast distribution center, and development of two smaller cross-dock facilities ( mixing centers ) in our Texas region to handle certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	We estimate that our capital expenditures relating to the distribution network will range between $75 million and $85 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	We also plan to invest in information technology upgrades at our stores and Store Support Center, which will include additional omni-channel capabilities, improved inventory allocation system, continued improvements in data security and enhanced customer relationship management.
916365_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Financing activities used cash of $340.5 million , $120.3 million, and $277.5 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2014 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised.
916365_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	The increase in net cash used in financing activities is largely due to an increase of $169.1 million in common stock repurchases made in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	On February 24, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $2 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2017 .
916365_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_15_ITEM7_P120_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_15_ITEM7_P120_S3	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_15_ITEM7_P120_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	We repurchased approximately 4.7 million , 2.3 million and 6.1 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $298.5 million , $129.4 million and $271.8 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	As of December 27, 2014 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $863.3 million , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2014 , we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.16 per share and, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 , we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.13 per share.
916365_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	We paid dividends totaling $84.1 million , $68.5 million and $51.3 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations and distribution center capacity, through the end of fiscal 2015.
916365_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 27, 2014 (in thousands):
916365_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	(a) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	(b) Reflects $17.8 million for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened and $41.0 million for the construction of our new distribution center located in Casa Grande, Arizona.
916365_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	At December 27, 2014 , there were $40.7 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and an $18.3 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases.
916365_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
916365_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.
916365_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.
916365_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.
916365_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances.
916365_15_ITEM7_P130_S3	The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited.
916365_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
916365_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, including which transition method it will adopt.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We may be exposed to changes in interest rates over the near term primarily from the Senior Credit Facility.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.25% at both December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 ) or LIBOR ( 0.17% and 0.16% at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum ( 0.50% at both December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We are also required to pay quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum ( 0.10% at both December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 27, 2014 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_15_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_15_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_15_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria .
916365_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 27, 2014 , and our report dated February 18, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 27, 2014 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
916365_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 27, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

916365_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
916365_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	At December 27, 2014 , the Company operated a total of 1,382 retail stores in 49 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	The fiscal years ended December 27, 2014 , December 28, 2013 , and December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company has established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on the Company s aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shrinkage The Company performs physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and the Company has established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Vendor Funding The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Certain of the Company s agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on the Company s current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Freight The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.
916365_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	For self-insured employee medical claims, we have a stop loss limit of $300,000 per person per year.
916365_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	Our deductible or self-insured retention, as applicable, for each claim involving workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance is limited to $500,000 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	Further, we maintained a commercially reasonable umbrella/excess policy that covers liabilities in excess of the primary insurance policy limits.
916365_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
916365_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant change in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the Company s financial results.
916365_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	At December 27, 2014 , the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of $48.3 million compared to $41.3 million at December 28, 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of the Company s sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company s compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	The business activities of the Company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_15_ITEM8_P32_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company s sales tax compliance.
916365_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.
916365_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_15_ITEM8_P33_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Tax Contingencies The Company s income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company s various tax filing positions, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_15_ITEM8_P34_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S4	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S5	The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_15_ITEM8_P40_S6	If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company s special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.
916365_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	At December 27, 2014 , the Company had a liability of $3.2 million reserved for sales returns compared to $3.1 million at December 28, 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company recognized breakage income of $0.9 million , $1.6 million and $1.2 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution centers, from distribution centers to retail stores, and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio and other promotions.
916365_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were approximately $70.4 million , $65.6 million and $62.6 million , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.5 million and $0.3 million at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Costs incurred at the Company s distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Distribution center costs including depreciation for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were approximately $121.1 million , $111.3 million and $90.2 million , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $8.9 million , $7.8 million and $7.1 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) to most employees that work at least 20 hours per week.
916365_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company s stock option awards.
916365_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Company relies on a blended volatility approach, weighting historical volatility trends and implied volatility, to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company s historical experience for similar options.
916365_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The fair value of the Company s restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company s common stock the day preceding the grant date.
916365_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.
916365_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	Dilutive shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company s comprehensive income is equal to net income in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Sales generated through the Company s private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.
916365_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	The Company had no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.
916365_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_15_ITEM8_P76_S2	Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_15_ITEM8_P76_S3	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company entered into agreements with various governmental entities in the states of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee to implement tax abatement plans related to its distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County), its distribution center in Macon, Georgia (Bibb County) and its new Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee (Williamson County).
916365_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_15_ITEM8_P77_S2	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 27, 2014 :
916365_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Computer software consists primarily of third-party software purchased for internal use.
916365_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	All goodwill is associated with the Company as a whole.
916365_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.
916365_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to the Company s operations.
916365_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.
916365_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the lease term.
916365_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the applicable lease term.
916365_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under the Company s ESPP.
916365_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company s share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2014 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	At December 27, 2014 , the Company had approximately 5.3 million shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Share-based compensation expense including changes in expense for modifications of awards was $16.2 million , $13.9 million and $17.6 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to current or prospective officers or employees, non-employee directors and consultants.
916365_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company uses a blended volatility approach, weighting (i) actual historical changes in the market value of the stock at 75% and (ii) average implied volatility using tradable option data at 25% .
916365_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	To derive implied volatility, the Company relies on publicly traded options, with maturities of six months or greater.
916365_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	The Company believes this blended calculation of historical and expected price volatility provides the most relevant indicator of future volatility.
916365_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested.
916365_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.
916365_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company issues shares for options when exercised.
916365_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows:
916365_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total difference between the Company s closing stock price at each year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at each year-end.
916365_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	As of December 27, 2014 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $17.2 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.3 years.
916365_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	There were no material modifications to options in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	Other information relative to option activity during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company issues shares for restricted stock unit awards once vesting occurs and related restrictions lapse.
916365_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The units vest over a one to four-year term; some plan participants have elected to defer receipt of shares of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock units, and as a result, shares are not issued until a later date.
916365_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	The status of restricted stock units is presented below:
916365_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Other information relative to restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld by the Company for the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, which the Company pays on behalf of its employees.
916365_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company issued 134,964 , 165,519 , and 359,924 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.
916365_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	The amounts are net of 77,192 , 78,943 , and 167,260 shares withheld to satisfy $4.8 million , $4.1 million , and $6.8 million of employees tax obligations during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	There were no material modifications to restricted stock units in fiscal 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
916365_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	As of December 27, 2014 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was approximately $6.0 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 2.8 years.
916365_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The ESPP provides Company employees the opportunity to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common stock at a 15% discount.
916365_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, the Company issued 78,670 , 86,555 and 95,836 shares of common stock during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P116_S2	The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation expense calculations, was approximately $1.0 million , $0.9 million and $0.8 million in fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
916365_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	There are a maximum of 16.0 million shares of common stock that are reserved under the ESPP.
916365_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	At December 27, 2014 , there were approximately 12.2 million remaining shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.
916365_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	Note 3 - Senior Credit Facility:
916365_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	On May 16, 2014, the Company exercised the option to increase the availability under the Senior Credit Facility by $150 million , which increased the aggregate principal amount available thereunder from $250 million to $400 million .
916365_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	The sublimit for swingline loans was also increased from $20 million to $30 million .

916365_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del s Feed Farm Supply and HomeTown Pet and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of products that support the rural lifestyle.
916365_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	At December 26, 2015 , we operated 1,488 retail stores in 49 states.

916365_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We believe our sales and earnings growth are the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:
916365_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Market Niche We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch and rural customers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Customers Our target customers are home, land, pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living.
916365_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	This customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Customer Service We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members.
916365_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs in addition to the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.
916365_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also engage with our customers through an e-commerce website ( TractorSupply.com ), which provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	Additionally, we maintain a customer solutions center at our Store Support Center located in Brentwood, Tennessee to support our in-store and online customers as well as our store team members.
916365_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
916365_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.
916365_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.
916365_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	Based on the third party provider s data, we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.
916365_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	We carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.
916365_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Store Personnel and Training We seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.

916365_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display.
916365_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.
916365_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.
916365_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.
916365_16_ITEM1_P9_S5	These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing, useful information regarding product benefits, and suggestions for appropriate accessories.

916365_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, edible ( C.U.E. ) products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	Examples of C.U.E product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products, such as heating, pest control and twine.
916365_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	We purchase our products from a group of approximately 800 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2015 .
916365_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Approximately 300 core vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2015 .
916365_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our product vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs.
916365_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions, and a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning.
916365_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
916365_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Intellectual Property Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP ( TSCT ), owns registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) for various service marks including TSC , Tractor Supply Co. , TSC Tractor Supply Co. and the trapezium design for retail store services.
916365_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business.
916365_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.
916365_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.
916365_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.
916365_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our exclusive brands represented approximately 31% of our total sales in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
916365_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	The exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.
916365_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.
916365_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Distribution We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2015 our stores received approximately 70% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate.
916365_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas, and Washington represent total distribution capacity of 5.0 million square feet.
916365_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	In 2015, we completed construction of a new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, with a capacity of approximately 650,000 square feet.
916365_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	This facility, which began shipping merchandise to stores in December 2015, will support our western store expansion.
916365_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	Also in 2015, we completed construction of two smaller cross-dock facilities ( mixing centers ) in Texas to handle certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We continue to improve the technology in our distribution facilities, and currently eight of our ten facilities utilize a warehouse management system that provides for improved movement of inventory.
916365_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	We will continue to refine this system and expect that it will be implemented in additional locations.
916365_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores.
916365_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.
916365_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries and manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
916365_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Marketing We utilize an everyday value price philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.
916365_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and email and digital offerings.
916365_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons.
916365_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.
916365_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Omni-Channel We communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website ( TractorSupply.com ), email and direct mail.
916365_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our goal is to be available when and how our customers choose to engage with our brand.
916365_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.
916365_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.
916365_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.
916365_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	We maintain a fulfillment center within our Franklin, Kentucky distribution center to support our e-commerce activities.
916365_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	Additionally in 2015, we continued to invest in our omni-channel platform and expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options, product information and site research.
916365_16_ITEM1_P30_S4	We also introduced responsive web design that provided an enhanced mobile and tablet experience, improved the site response time and added additional product offerings for vendor direct to customer shipments.
916365_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	HomeTown Pet We opened two HomeTown Pet stores in fiscal 2014.
916365_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	HomeTown Pet is a new pet supply store that provides high-quality products, knowledge and service to pet owners.
916365_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	The stores offer products for a wide variety of pets and animals, including cats, dogs, birds, reptiles and fish, as well as grooming and vet services.
916365_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	We are a test-and-learn company, and we believe these stores will help us gain better insight into the pet and animal supply category and provide valuable information that can help us better understand the unique needs of our pet customers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Management and Team Members As of December 26, 2015 , we employed approximately 12,000 full-time and 11,000 part-time team members.
916365_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.
916365_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
916365_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	At the end of fiscal 2015, our store operations were organized into nine regions.
916365_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Each region is led by a regional director or vice president, and the region is further organized into districts, each of which is led by a district manager.
916365_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have two internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
916365_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	All of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.
916365_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition to bonus incentive programs, we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan.
916365_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.
916365_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.
916365_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility.
916365_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years.
916365_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Continuous Improvement We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System ( TVS ), which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Through TVS, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.
916365_16_ITEM1_P36_S5	Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
916365_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations.
916365_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our key management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a warehouse management system, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system.
916365_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system.
916365_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
916365_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.
916365_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
916365_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements.
916365_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	We continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store, distribution facility and omni-channel expansion.
916365_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	These efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.
916365_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday value price philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via omni-channel enhancements, tying together our website product content, social media and online shopping experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.3% .
916365_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	We plan to open approximately 115 to 120 new stores in 2016 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0% .
916365_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	We opened 114 new stores in 2015 and 107 new stores in 2014 , which represents selling square footage increases of approximately 8.0% during fiscal 2015 and 8.3% during fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	At December 26, 2015 , we operated 1,488 retail stores in 49 states.
916365_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	Approximately 58% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 42% are located in strip shopping centers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	We lease approximately 93% of our stores and own the remaining 7% .
916365_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.
916365_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	See further discussion of competition in 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.
916365_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S5	These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, high efficiency lighting and heating/air conditioning systems in our stores, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution facilities and the Store Support Center.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S6	Our Store Support Center, opened in 2014, and our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, opened in 2015, were each awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification for environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation.
916365_16_ITEM1_P47_S7	We also installed solar arrays at the Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee and our store in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

916365_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.
916365_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
916365_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We make available free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	us, could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Past comparable store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse influence on our profitability.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Capital required for growth may not be available.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The construction or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In the past, our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	(as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, other specialty retailers, internet retailers, independently owned farm and ranch stores, regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers or landlords indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We receive certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	While we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omni-channel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Omni-channel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand our management information systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Delays in opening distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $2 billion through December 2017, we may discontinue this program at any time.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	That multiple is in part dependent on investors perception of the Company s future earnings growth prospects.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If investor perceptions of the Company s earnings growth prospects change, the Company s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributors, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) as well as state and local taxing authorities.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_16_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 26, 2015 , the Company operated 1,488 stores in 49 states.
916365_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company leases approximately 93% of its stores, two distribution sites and its Merchandising Innovation Center (planogram) located in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to Company operations.
916365_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following is a count of store locations by state:
916365_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	(a) Includes the Company s two HomeTown Pet stores.
916365_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following is a list of distribution locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:
916365_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	(a) The leased facility in Hagerstown is treated as an extension of the existing owned Hagerstown location and is not considered a separate distribution center.
916365_16_ITEM2_P4_S1	(b) This is a mixing center designed to process certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company s Store Support Center occupies approximately 260,000 square feet of owned building space in Brentwood, Tennessee, and the Company s Merchandising Innovation Center occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of leased building space in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.
916365_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines that were noncompliant.
916365_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	The products at issue were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all the applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.
916365_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company notified these vendors of the EPA s position and worked with these vendors to provide additional information to the DOJ and EPA regarding the alleged violations.
916365_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	As a result of this process, the Company and its vendors provided evidence that many of the products identified by the DOJ and EPA in early 2011 were, in fact, in compliance with the Clean Air Act and that most of the remaining issues related to products purchased from one vendor.
916365_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	The vendor of these products and the Company engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ and EPA that resulted in the settlement of the matter.
916365_16_ITEM3_P1_S4	A consent decree reflecting the terms of the settlement was filed with the United States District Court in Washington, D.C. on September 30, 2015.
916365_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	Under the settlement, the Company agreed to implement a formal compliance program for the small-engine products purchased by the Company for resale to its customers.
916365_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company also agreed to pay a civil penalty, most of which was reimbursed by the vendor who sold the small-engine products at issue to the Company.
916365_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	In addition, the Company agreed to sponsor an emissions offset program that will result in the replacement of 22 older wood-burning stoves with EPA-certified wood-burning stoves.
916365_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	The settlement was approved by the court on January 19, 2016.
916365_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	The civil penalty did not differ materially from the amount accrued.
916365_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The cost of the settlement and the compliance and emission offset program will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	The Company is also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
916365_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Company believes that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.
916365_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	Accordingly, the Company currently expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
916365_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of January 29, 2016, the number of record holders of our common stock was 700 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 100,000.
916365_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	During 2015 and 2014 , the Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:
916365_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, as well as other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	On February 3, 2016 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2016 , to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2016 .
916365_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2017 .
916365_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	Additionally, the Company withholds shares from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_16_ITEM5_P6_S2	Stock purchase activity during fiscal 2015 is set forth in the table below:
916365_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements of 12,940 during the first quarter, 206 during the second quarter, and 22,196 during the third quarter.
916365_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.
916365_16_ITEM5_P9_S0	The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	Any additional stock repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_16_ITEM5_P10_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_16_ITEM5_P11_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_16_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock from December 25, 2010 to December 26, 2015 (the Company s fiscal year-end) with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_16_ITEM5_P12_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 25, 2010 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and in each case assumes reinvestment of dividends.
916365_16_ITEM5_P13_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
916365_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	(c) Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S3	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S4	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S5	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S6	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S7	(d) New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S8	(e) Assumes average inventory cost, excluding inventory in-transit.
916365_16_ITEM6_P3_S9	(f) Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company s 2011 Senior Credit Facility and capital lease obligations, excluding the current portions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 26, 2015 (our fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
916365_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 26, 2015 , we operated 1,488 retail stores in 49 states under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del s Feed Farm Supply and HomeTown Pet.
916365_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	We also operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com .
916365_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.
916365_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday value price philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via omni-channel enhancements, tying together our website product content, social media and online shopping experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth.
916365_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 1,001 stores at the end of 2010 to 1,488 stores at the end of fiscal 2015 , and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.3% .
916365_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 1,000 additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We opened 114 new stores in 2015 and 107 new stores in 2014 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0% in fiscal 2015 and approximately 8.3% in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	During 2015 , we opened stores in 33 states and completed construction of a new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona to support our continued expansion into the western states.
916365_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Also in 2015, we completed construction of two smaller cross-dock facilities ( mixing centers ) in Texas to improve distribution of certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales increased 9.0% to $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015 from $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Comparable store sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2015 versus a 3.8% increase in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Gross profit increased 9.9% to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014 , and gross margin increased 30 basis points to 34.4% of sales in fiscal 2015 from 34.1% of sales in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Operating income increased 10 basis points to 10.4% of net sales in fiscal 2015 from 10.3% of net sales in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	In fiscal 2015 , diluted earnings per share grew 12.8% , to $3.00 compared to $2.66 in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We ended the year with $63.8 million in cash and outstanding debt of $ 150.0 million, after returning $395.8 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	We have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve as of December 26, 2015, would have affected net income by approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve as of December 26, 2015, would have affected net income by approximately $1.2 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectability.
916365_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support.
916365_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectability risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 26, 2015, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 26, 2015, net income would have been affected by approximately $6.6 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Provisions for losses related to our self-insured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves as of December 26, 2015, would have affected net income by approximately $3.2 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	When establishing our sales tax audit reserve, we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk as well as our historical experience with each respective state.
916365_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve as of December 26, 2015, would have affected net income by approximately $0.8 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve as of December 26, 2015 would have affected net income by approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2015.
916365_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2015 and 2014 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	(a) Comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	Stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others (like our Company) exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net sales increased 9.0% to $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015 from $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 were $5.89 billion , a 3.1% increase over fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	This compares to a 3.8% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 3.3% , while comparable store average ticket decreased (0.2)% for fiscal 2015 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_16_ITEM7_P77_S4	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of consumable, usable, edible ("C.U.E.") products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	Hardline products such as fencing, trailers and towing also performed well throughout the year.
916365_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	The full year sales performance was negatively impacted by fourth quarter weakness in the key cold weather seasonal categories of heating (stoves and fuel) and insulated outerwear along with softness in seasonal big ticket items such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators.
916365_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2015 , sales from stores opened less than one year were $351.0 million in fiscal 2015 , which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 9.0% increase over fiscal 2014 net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $353.4 million in fiscal 2014 , which represented 6.8 percentage points of the 10.6% increase over fiscal 2013 net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2015 and 2014 :
916365_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2015 and 2014 :
916365_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Gross profit increased 9.9% to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 30 basis points to 34.4% for fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	This increase in gross margin principally reflects improved direct product margin.
916365_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of strong execution on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 20 basis points to 24.0% in fiscal 2015 from 23.8% in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	costs at the stores and incremental costs associated with our two new mixing centers and our new distribution facility in Casa Grande, Arizona.
916365_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2015 increased 9.7% to $1.49 billion from $1.36 billion in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	The increase in SG A expenses primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth.
916365_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2015 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2014 predominantly as a result of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2015 increased 10.7% to $410.4 million , or $3.00 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $370.9 million , or $2.66 per diluted share, in fiscal 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	During fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $292.7 million as part of our $2 billion share repurchase program.
916365_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	In fiscal 2014 , we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares at a total cost of $298.5 million .
916365_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Net sales increased 10.6% to $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014 from $5.16 billion in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2014 were $5.37 billion, a 3.8% increase over fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	This compares to a 4.8% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 3.2%, while comparable store average ticket increased 0.6% for fiscal 2014.
916365_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in key C.U.E. products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise, and an increase in traffic counts.
916365_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	This was a result of continued investment in C.U.E. inventory, expanded product assortments and improved localized product offerings.
916365_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Seasonal merchandise, predominantly heating and outdoor power equipment, performed well during the year.
916365_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	We also estimate that comparable store sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 85 basis points due to deflation, principally in livestock feed and bird feeding products.
916365_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2014, sales from stores opened less than one year were $353.4 million in fiscal 2014, which represented 6.8 percentage points of the 10.6% increase over fiscal 2013 net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $281.2 million in fiscal 2013, which represented 6.0 percentage points of the 10.7% increase over fiscal 2012 net sales.
916365_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2014 and 2013 :
916365_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	(a) Includes the Company s two HomeTown Pet stores opened in fiscal 2014.
916365_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2014 and 2013 :
916365_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gross profit increased 11.2% to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $1.75 billion in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 34.1% for fiscal 2014 compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	This improvement in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by higher transportation costs, primarily due to our continued western store expansion.
916365_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of continued focus on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	As a percent of sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 20 basis points to 23.8% in fiscal 2014 from 24.0% in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of comparable store sales growth and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2014 increased 9.8% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	The increase in SG A primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth.
916365_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our effective tax rate increased to 36.9% for fiscal 2014 compared to 36.2% in fiscal 2013 as the prior year was favorably impacted by the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2014 increased 13.0% to $370.9 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $328.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $298.5 million as part of our previously announced $2 billion share repurchase program.
916365_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	In fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $129.4 million.
916365_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution facilities capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, share repurchases and cash dividends.
916365_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, funds available under our credit facility (as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	At December 26, 2015 , the Company had working capital of $814.1 million , which increased $143.2 million from December 27, 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	In comparison to December 27, 2014 , working capital as of December 26, 2015 was impacted most significantly by changes in our inventory and accounts payable.
916365_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	The increase in inventory was due to new store growth and an increase in average inventory per store of 9.0% compared to the prior year.
916365_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	The increase in average inventory per store is principally related to a carry-over of cold-weather merchandise, additional investment in C.U.E. products and early receipt of certain spring seasonal items.
916365_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth and higher average inventory per store along with timing of payments to vendors.
916365_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	During the period of October 24, 2011 through February 19, 2016, the Company was party to a senior credit facility (the 2011 Senior Credit Facility ), which provided for borrowings up to $400 million (with a sublimit of $30 million for swingline loans) as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
916365_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	The 2011 Senior Credit Facility was unsecured and would have matured on October 24, 2016.
916365_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	On February 19, 2016, the Company replaced the 2011 Senior Credit Facility by entering into a new senior credit facility (the 2016 Senior Credit Facility ) consisting of a $200 million term loan and a $500 million revolving credit facility (with a sublimit of $50 million for swingline loans).
916365_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	This agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2021, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and other matters.
916365_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	As a result of the maturity date in the new agreement, the Company has presented any outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility as of December 26, 2015 as a non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.
916365_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	At December 26, 2015 there were $150.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility and no outstanding borrowings at December 27, 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	There were $48.7 million and $40.7 million outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	Borrowings bore interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.50% at December 26, 2015 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.42% at December 26, 2015 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum ( 0.50% at December 26, 2015 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P106_S3	The Company was also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum ( 0.10% at December 26, 2015 ), adjusted quarterly based on the Company s leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P106_S4	There were no compensating balance requirements associated with the 2011 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	The 2011 Senior Credit Facility required quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio compared earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	The leverage ratio compared total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	The 2011 Senior Credit Facility also contained certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_16_ITEM7_P107_S4	The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 26, 2015 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility contains a $200 million term loan which requires quarterly payments totaling $10 million a year in years one and two and $20 million a year in years three through five, with the remaining balance due in full on the maturity date of February 19, 2021.
916365_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also contains a $500 million revolving credit facility (with a sublimit of $50 million for swingline loans).
916365_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Borrowings for both the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the bank s base rate or LIBOR plus an additional amount ranging from 0.500% to 1.125% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.075% to 0.200% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on the Company s leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Credit Facility are available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and other matters.
916365_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares consolidated EBITDAR to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	The leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our credit facility (as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
916365_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.
916365_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	The following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Operating activities provided net cash of $429.2 million , $409.2 million and $333.7 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	The $20.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	The $20.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflects earnings growth and a favorable impact from the timing of deferred taxes partially offset by a net increase in inventories and accounts payable.
916365_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	Inventory increased due to store growth, the carry-over of cold-weather merchandise, additional investment in C.U.E. products and the timing of spring seasonal receipts while accounts payable grew at a lower rate due mainly to the timing of payments.
916365_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	The $75.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):
916365_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	The $75.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflects earnings growth, the favorable impacts related to the timing of tax benefits and income tax payments, and increased depreciation and amortization expense due to capital expenditures for store growth, distribution facility capacity and corporate infrastructure.
916365_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	Investing activities used cash of $235.9 million , $160.3 million and $209.3 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	The changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects changes in capital expenditures.
916365_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in millions):
916365_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	The above table reflects 114 new stores and six relocations during fiscal 2015 , 107 new stores and two relocations during fiscal 2014 and 102 new stores and three relocations during fiscal 2013 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	The increase in spending on distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2015 is primarily due to the construction of two mixing centers in Texas which opened during the third quarter and our new southwest distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona which began shipping merchandise to stores in the fourth quarter.
916365_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	The increase in spending on information technology in fiscal 2015 represents continued improvements in data security and enhanced customer relationship management.
916365_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	The majority of the corporate and other category for fiscal 2014 and 2013 relates to construction of our Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee with the greatest portion of the spend in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The higher capital expenditures for distribution facility capacity and improvements in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to construction of our Macon, Georgia distribution center, which was the relocation of our former leased Southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia.
916365_16_ITEM7_P119_S2	We did not purchase any leased stores during fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 compared to having purchased three leased stores in fiscal 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $230 million and $250 million in fiscal 2016 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	We plan to open approximately 115 to 120 stores in fiscal 2016 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Additionally, we plan to relocate five stores as well as increase our investment in existing store renovations.
916365_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	We plan to invest in our ongoing sustainability efforts by beginning to retrofit our stores with LED lighting in fiscal 2016 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	We also plan to invest in information technology for improvements in security and compliance and continued support of our growth strategy and other strategic investments.
916365_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Financing activities used cash of $180.6 million , $340.5 million, and $120.3 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility, net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation, and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised.
916365_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is largely due to $150 million of net borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $2 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2017 .
916365_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_16_ITEM7_P125_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	We repurchased approximately 3.4 million , 4.7 million and 2.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $292.7 million , $298.5 million and $129.4 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	As of December 26, 2015 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $570.7 million , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2015 , we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.20 per share and, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 , we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.16 per share.
916365_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	We paid dividends totaling $103.1 million , $84.1 million and $68.5 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our credit facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity, through the end of fiscal 2016.
916365_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 26, 2015 (in thousands):
916365_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	(a) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	At December 26, 2015 , there were $48.7 million outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases.
916365_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.
916365_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.
916365_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.
916365_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances.
916365_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date which implemented a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09.
916365_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	As a result of the deferral, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
916365_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
916365_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, including which transition method it will adopt.
916365_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
916365_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	ASU 2015-03 requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
916365_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
916365_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" ( ASU 2015-11 ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	This update requires an entity that determines the cost of inventory by methods other than last-in, first-out and the retail inventory method to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
916365_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	ASU 2015-11 requires prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
916365_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S2	ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S3	The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S4	Upon adoption, the updated guidance will affect the presentation of the deferred tax liabilities and assets within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the updated guidance will not affect the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and assets.
916365_16_ITEM7_P142_S5	Other than the change in presentation, the Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of our credit facility (as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which bears interest based on variable rates.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	A 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have affected interest expense by approximately $1.1 million, $0.7 million, and $0.3 million in the fiscal years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on debt existing as of December 26, 2015, would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately $1.5 million per year.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 26, 2015 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_16_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_16_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria .
916365_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 26, 2015 , and our report dated February 22, 2016 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

916365_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
916365_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 26, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

916365_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
916365_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	At December 26, 2015 , the Company operated a total of 1,488 retail stores in 49 states and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	The fiscal years ended December 26, 2015 , December 27, 2014 , and December 28, 2013 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company has established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on the Company s aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shrinkage The Company performs physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and the Company has established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Vendor Funding The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	Certain of the Company s agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_16_ITEM8_P27_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on the Company s current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Freight The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.
916365_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	For self-insured employee medical claims, we have a stop loss limit of $300,000 per person per year.
916365_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	Our deductible or self-insured retention, as applicable, for each claim involving workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance is limited to $500,000 and our Texas Work Injury Policy is limited to $750,000 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P30_S4	Further, we maintain a commercially reasonable umbrella/excess policy that covers liabilities in excess of the primary insurance policy limits.
916365_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
916365_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant change in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the Company s financial results.
916365_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	At December 26, 2015 , the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of $51.2 million compared to $48.3 million at December 27, 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of the Company s sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company s compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	The business activities of the Company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex tax compliance environment.
916365_16_ITEM8_P32_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company s sales tax compliance.
916365_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.
916365_16_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_16_ITEM8_P33_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Tax Contingencies The Company s income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company s various tax filing positions, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_16_ITEM8_P34_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S4	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S5	The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_16_ITEM8_P40_S6	If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company s special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.
916365_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	At December 26, 2015 , the Company had a liability of $3.3 million reserved for sales returns compared to $3.2 million at December 27, 2014 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company recognized breakage income of $1.6 million , $0.9 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution facilities, from distribution facilities to retail stores, and from one distribution facility to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or net realizable value, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution facility and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio and other promotions.
916365_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were approximately $73.9 million , $70.4 million and $65.6 million , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P49_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $1.6 million and $0.5 million at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Costs incurred at the Company s distribution facilities for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	Distribution facility costs including depreciation for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were approximately $145.4 million , $121.1 million and $111.3 million , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $9.6 million , $8.9 million and $7.8 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) to most employees that work at least 20 hours per week.
916365_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company s stock option awards.
916365_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company relies on a blended volatility approach, weighting historical volatility trends and implied volatility, to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_16_ITEM8_P55_S3	The expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company s historical experience for similar options.
916365_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The fair value of the Company s restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company s common stock the day preceding the grant date.
916365_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution facility and corporate assets.
916365_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.

916365_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.
916365_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.
916365_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	The Company had $150.0 million in borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility (as defined in Note 3) at December 26, 2015 and no borrowings as of December 27, 2014 .

916365_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 26, 2015 :
916365_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.

916365_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_16_ITEM8_P80_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	All goodwill is associated with the Company as a whole.
916365_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.
916365_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to the Company s operations.
916365_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.
916365_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.
916365_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the lease term.
916365_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the applicable lease term.
916365_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under the Company s ESPP.
916365_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company s share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2015 .

916365_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company uses a blended volatility approach, weighting (i) actual historical changes in the market value of the stock at 75% and (ii) average implied volatility using tradable option data at 25% .
916365_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	To derive implied volatility, the Company relies on publicly traded options, with maturities of six months or greater.
916365_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company believes this blended calculation of historical and expected price volatility provides the most relevant indicator of future volatility.
916365_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested.
916365_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

916365_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Other information relative to restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld by the Company for the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, which the Company pays on behalf of its employees.
916365_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Company issued 72,206 , 134,964 , and 165,519 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
916365_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.
916365_16_ITEM8_P112_S3	The amounts are net of 35,342 , 77,192 , and 78,943 shares withheld to satisfy $3.0 million , $4.8 million , and $4.1 million of employees tax obligations during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

916365_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.

916365_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
916365_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
916365_16_ITEM8_P167_S1	This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.
916365_16_ITEM8_P167_S2	ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
916365_16_ITEM8_P167_S3	The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
916365_16_ITEM8_P167_S4	Upon adoption, the updated guidance will affect the presentation of the deferred tax liabilities and assets within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the updated guidance will not affect the accounting for deferred tax liabilities and assets.

916365_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports as required.

916365_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
916365_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	We are an electronic filer and the SEC maintains an Internet site at sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically.
916365_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We make available, free of charge through our Internet website, TractorSupply.com , our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
916365_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, data privacy, and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers, increased presence of online retailers, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	While extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects, they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Capital required for growth may not be available The construction or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In the past, our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our access to funds under our senior credit facility (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the target business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The results of the November 2016 elections in the United States have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We source a significant portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia and Central America.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers compensation, product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers or landlords indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We receive certain personal and other confidential information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, our online operations at TractorSupply.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	While we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain and misuse the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	It is possible that such a compromise could go undetected by us.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omni-channel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Omni-channel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand our management information systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Delays in opening distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion through December 2020, we may discontinue this program at any time.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Company s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	That multiple is in part dependent on investors perception of the Company s future earnings growth prospects.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If investor perceptions of the Company s earnings growth prospects change, the Company s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributors, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health, including, for example, regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail sector s compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform, changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), as well as state and local taxing authorities.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the Company operated 1,738 stores in 49 states.
916365_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company leases approximately 94% of its stores, two distribution sites, its Merchandising Innovation Center (planogram) located in Nashville, Tennessee, as well as the Petsense corporate headquarters located in Scottsdale, Arizona.
916365_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to Company operations.
916365_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following is a count of store locations by state:
916365_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	The following is a list of distribution locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:
916365_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	(a) The leased facility in Hagerstown is treated as an extension of the existing owned Hagerstown location and is not considered a separate distribution center.
916365_17_ITEM2_P3_S1	(b) This is a mixing center designed to process certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Company s Store Support Center occupies approximately 260,000 square feet of owned building space in Brentwood, Tennessee, and the Company s Merchandising Innovation Center occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of leased building space in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	In fiscal 2017, we plan to begin construction on a new northeast distribution center, as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed.
916365_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Tractor Supply Company s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TSCO .
916365_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 3, 2017, the number of record holders of our common stock was 607 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was 115,000.
916365_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	During 2016 and 2015 , the Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:
916365_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition and capital needs of the Company, as well as other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	On February 8, 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 14, 2017 , to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 27, 2017 .
916365_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program.
916365_17_ITEM5_P6_S1	On October 31, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to $3 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases and extended the program through December 31, 2020 .
916365_17_ITEM5_P6_S2	Additionally, the Company withholds shares from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_17_ITEM5_P6_S3	Stock purchase activity during fiscal 2016 is set forth in the table below:
916365_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements of 10,236 during the first quarter.
916365_17_ITEM5_P7_S1	(b) The Board authorized a $1 billion increase to its existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to $3 billion.
916365_17_ITEM5_P7_S2	The program, established in February 2007, has been extended through December 31, 2020.
916365_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.
916365_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_17_ITEM5_P10_S0	Any additional stock repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_17_ITEM5_P10_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time, without prior notice.
916365_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_17_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2016 (the Company s fiscal year-end), with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_17_ITEM5_P12_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2011 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and in each case assumes reinvestment of dividends.
916365_17_ITEM5_P13_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not indicative of future performance.
916365_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2016 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S2	(b) Beginning in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of Petsense, unless otherwise noted.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S3	(c) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S4	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S5	(d) Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S6	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S7	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S8	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S9	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_17_ITEM6_P2_S10	Petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition.
916365_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	(e) New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.
916365_17_ITEM6_P3_S1	(f) Assumes average inventory cost, excluding inventory in-transit.
916365_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	(g) Working capital for 2016 and 2015 reflects deferred tax assets as non-current as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17 (which is discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
916365_17_ITEM6_P3_S3	Years prior to 2015 have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this guidance.
916365_17_ITEM6_P4_S0	(h) Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company s senior credit facility and capital lease obligations, excluding the current portions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 (our fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ).
916365_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
916365_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we operated 1,738 retail stores in 49 states under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del s Feed Farm Supply and Petsense.
916365_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	We also operate websites under the names TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com .
916365_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.
916365_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday value price philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via omni-channel enhancements, tying together our website product content, social media, digital and online shopping experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.
916365_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 1,085 stores at the end of 2011 to 1,738 stores ( 1,595 Tractor Supply and Del s retail stores and 143 Petsense retail stores) at the end of fiscal 2016 , and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.9% .
916365_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 900 additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores.
916365_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	In 2016 , we opened 113 new Tractor Supply stores in 37 states and began operating 143 Petsense stores in 26 states, as compared to 114 new Tractor Supply stores in 2015 , resulting in a selling square footage increase of approximately 10.8% in fiscal 2016 and approximately 8.0% in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales increased 8.9% to $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Comparable store sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2016 versus a 3.1% increase in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Gross profit increased 8.5% to $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 from $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015 , and gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 34.3% of net sales in fiscal 2016 from 34.4% of net sales in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Operating income decreased 20 basis points to 10.2% of net sales in fiscal 2016 from 10.4% of net sales in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	In fiscal 2016 , diluted earnings per share grew 9.0% to $3.27 compared to $3.00 in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We ended the year with $53.9 million in cash and outstanding debt of $275.0 million , after returning $454.0 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
916365_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	We have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve as of December 31, 2016, would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We perform physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months, and we have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve as of December 31, 2016, would have affected net income by approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	During interim periods, the amount of volume rebates is estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectability.
916365_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor funding reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor funding.
916365_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectability risk related to vendor funding amounts due to us at the end of fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor funding due as of December 31, 2016, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.3 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor funding, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 31, 2016, net income would have been affected by approximately $6.9 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans.
916365_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Provisions for losses related to our self-insured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2016, would have affected net income by approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	When establishing our sales tax audit reserve, we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk as well as our historical experience with each respective state.
916365_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve as of December 31, 2016, would have affected net income by approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by United States federal and state tax authorities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve as of December 31, 2016 would have affected net income by approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:
916365_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
916365_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
916365_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.
916365_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process.
916365_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both.
916365_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
916365_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
916365_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	If the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting prospective financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate indefinite-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2016 and 2015 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	(a) Beginning in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of Petsense, unless otherwise noted.
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	(b) Comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	Closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	Stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	Petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition.
916365_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others (like our Company) exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Net sales increased 8.9% to $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The fourth quarter included an extra sales week as a part of the Company s 53-week calendar in 2016, which represented 1.6% of the overall 8.9% sales increase over prior year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2016 were $6.41 billion , a 1.6% increase over fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	This compares to a 3.1% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P85_S4	The comparable store transaction count increased 2.6% , while comparable store average ticket decreased 0.9% for fiscal 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	Petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition.
916365_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of consumable, usable, and edible ("C.U.E.") products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Livestock equipment and hardline products such as fencing and trailers also performed well throughout the year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	The full year sales performance was negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns during the spring selling season and unseasonably warm weather in the key cold months of the year which drove softness in cold weather seasonal categories and big ticket items such as log splitters and stoves.
916365_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	Additionally, the Company believes that economic conditions in the energy producing markets negatively impacted consumer spending primarily in the Midwest and South Central regions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2016 , sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were $378.9 million in fiscal 2016 , which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 8.9% increase over fiscal 2015 net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $351.0 million in fiscal 2015 , which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 9.0% increase over fiscal 2014 net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2016 and 2015 :
916365_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016 and 2015 :
916365_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Gross profit increased 8.5% to $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	As a percent of net sales, gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 34.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 34.4% for fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	This decrease in gross margin percentage principally reflects a higher mix of C.U.E. products, which generally carry below chain average gross margin, partially offset by benefits from our key margin driving initiatives.
916365_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Freight expense as a percent of net sales experienced a marginal increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year due principally to an increase in inbound miles and domestic transportation costs, partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and import container costs.
916365_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 24.1% in fiscal 2016 from 24.0% in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	SG A expenses as a percent of net sales increased due to incremental costs associated with our new distribution facilities that began operations in late fiscal 2015, as well as acquisition and operating expenses associated with the Petsense purchase.
916365_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	These increases were partially offset by leverage of occupancy costs, as well as lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2016 increased 9.3% to $1.63 billion from $1.49 billion in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P93_S4	The increase in SG A expenses primarily reflects new store growth, incremental costs from operating the new distribution facilities, variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth and the extra sales week during the year and incremental expenses associated with the Petsense acquisition and its operations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due principally to the availability of federal and state tax incentives.
916365_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2016 increased 6.5% to $437.1 million , or $3.27 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $410.4 million , or $3.00 per diluted share, in fiscal 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	During fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $331.7 million as part of our $3 billion share repurchase program.
916365_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	In fiscal 2015 , we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at a total cost of $292.7 million .
916365_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Net sales increased 9.0% to $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015 from $5.71 billion in fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 were $5.89 billion, a 3.1% increase over fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	This compares to a 3.8% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P97_S3	The comparable store transaction count increased 3.3%, while comparable store average ticket decreased 0.2% for fiscal 2015.
916365_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_17_ITEM7_P98_S4	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of C.U.E. products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Hardline products such as fencing, trailers and towing also performed well throughout the year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	The full year sales performance was negatively impacted by fourth quarter weakness in the key cold weather seasonal categories of heating (stoves and fuel) and insulated outerwear along with softness in seasonal big ticket items such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators.
916365_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2015, sales from stores opened less than one year were $351.0 million in fiscal 2015, which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 9.0% increase over fiscal 2014 net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $353.4 million in fiscal 2014, which represented 6.8 percentage points of the 10.6% increase over fiscal 2013 net sales.
916365_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2015 and 2014 :
916365_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	The following chart indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2015 and 2014 :
916365_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Gross profit increased 9.9% to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	As a percent of net sales, gross margin increased 30 basis points to 34.4% for fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	This increase in gross margin principally reflects improved direct product margin.
916365_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	Direct product margin increased as a result of strong execution on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and retail price management.
916365_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	As a percent of net sales, SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 20 basis points to 24.0% in fiscal 2015 from 23.8% in fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	This increase in SG A expense as a percent of net sales was mainly related to deleverage in rent and other occupancy costs at the stores and incremental costs associated with our two new mixing centers and our new distribution facility in Casa Grande, Arizona.
916365_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2015 increased 9.7% to $1.49 billion from $1.36 billion in fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth and variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth.
916365_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2015 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2014 predominantly as a result of the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2015 increased 10.7% to $410.4 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $370.9 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, in fiscal 2014.
916365_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $292.7 million as part of our share repurchase program.
916365_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	In fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares at a total cost of $298.5 million.
916365_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution facilities capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, share repurchases, cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.
916365_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	cash balances, cash provided from operations, funds available under our senior credit facility (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had working capital of $740.6 million , which decreased $27.6 million from December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	(a) Working capital for 2016 and 2015 reflects deferred tax assets as non-current as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17 in 2016 (which is discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
916365_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	In comparison to December 26, 2015 , working capital as of December 31, 2016 was impacted most significantly by changes in our inventory and accounts payable.
916365_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	The increase in inventory resulted from the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth as well as the acquisition of Petsense.
916365_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	Average inventory per store decreased year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
916365_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth along with timing of payments to vendors.
916365_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	The decrease in accrued employee compensation is due to lower year-over-year incentive compensation and the timing of payroll accruals.
916365_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	The increase in other accrued expenses is a result of Company growth and the timing of payments.
916365_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	The current portion of long-term debt relates to the term loan which was entered into in fiscal 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into a senior credit facility (the 2016 Senior Credit Facility ) consisting of a $200 million term loan and a $500 million revolving credit facility (with a sublimit of $50 million for swingline loans).
916365_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	This agreement is unsecured and matures on February 19, 2021 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	During the period of October 24, 2011 through February 19, 2016, the Company was party to a senior credit facility (the 2011 Senior Credit Facility ), which provided for borrowings up to $400 million (with a sublimit of $30 million for swingline loans) as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	date of February 19, 2021 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also contains a $500 million revolving credit facility (with a sublimit of $50 million for swingline loans).
916365_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had outstanding total borrowings of $275.0 million under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility consisting of $190.0 million in borrowings under the term loan and $85.0 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
916365_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	Unamortized debt issuance costs recorded as an offset to the outstanding borrowings were approximately $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	Additionally, there were $44.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Borrowings under both the term loan and the revolver bear interest at either the bank s base rate ( 3.750% at December 31, 2016 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.772% at December 31, 2016 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.500% to 1.125% per annum ( 0.625% at December 31, 2016 ), adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio.
916365_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	The Company is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.075% to 0.200% per annum ( 0.100% at December 31, 2016 ), adjusted quarterly based on the Company s leverage ratio.
916365_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Credit Facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and other matters.
916365_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.
916365_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	Both ratios are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio shall be greater than or equal to 2.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	The leverage ratio compares rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six plus total debt to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	The leverage ratio shall be less than or equal to 4.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_17_ITEM7_P127_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
916365_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $150.0 million as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	In addition, there were $48.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	On March 28, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which became effective on March 31, 2016 with a maturity date of February 19, 2021 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	The interest rate swap was executed for risk management and is not held for trading purposes.
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S2	The objective of the interest rate swap is to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates.
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S3	To accomplish this objective, the interest rate swap is intended to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the variable rate term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S4	The notional amount of the interest rate swap began at $197.5 million (the principal amount of the term loan borrowings as of March 31, 2016) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the term loan borrowings as described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_17_ITEM7_P129_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , the notional amount of the interest rate swap was $190.0 million .
916365_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	The interest rate swap entitles the Company to receive, at specified intervals, a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR in exchange for the payment of a fixed rate of interest throughout the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
916365_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our senior credit facility (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
916365_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock, cash dividends paid to stockholders and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.
916365_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	The following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):
916365_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Operating activities provided net cash of $639.0 million , $429.2 million and $409.2 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	The $209.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in the following (in millions):
916365_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	The $209.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflects incremental profitability and the impact of effective management of inventory and accounts payable levels.
916365_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	Average inventory per store decreased year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
916365_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	Additionally, the timing of payments to vendors more closely aligned with receipt of inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 in comparison with the end of fiscal 2015, resulting in an improvement in cash flow year-over-year.
916365_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	The $20.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 was primarily due to changes in the following (in millions):
916365_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	The $20.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflects earnings growth, the favorable impact from the timing of deferred taxes partially offset by a net increase in inventories and accounts payable.
916365_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	Inventory increased due to store growth, the carry-over of cold-weather merchandise, additional investment in C.U.E.
916365_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	products and the timing of spring seasonal receipts while accounts payable grew at a lower rate due mainly to the timing of payments.
916365_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	Investing activities used cash of $369.3 million , $235.9 million and $160.3 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	The changes in cash used for investing activities primarily reflects the acquisition of Petsense and changes in capital expenditures.
916365_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):
916365_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	The above table reflects 113 new Tractor Supply stores and three relocations, as well as eight new Petsense stores during fiscal 2016 , 114 new stores and six relocations during fiscal 2015 and 107 new stores and two relocations during fiscal 2014 .
916365_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	The increase in spending on existing stores in fiscal 2016 primarily reflects an investment in the chain-wide LED lighting retrofit, which will be completed in fiscal 2017.
916365_17_ITEM7_P140_S2	The sustained increase in spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omni-channel platform as well as improvements in security and compliance, enhancements to our customer relationship management and other strategic initiatives.
916365_17_ITEM7_P140_S3	Spending for distribution center capacity and improvements increased substantially in fiscal 2015 as a result of the construction of two mixing centers in Texas and the southwest distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, all of which began operations in fiscal 2015.
916365_17_ITEM7_P140_S4	Lastly, the construction of our Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, resulted in higher costs in fiscal 2014 for corporate and other spending.
916365_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	We currently estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 will range between $270 million and $290 million.
916365_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	We will to continue to invest in our ongoing sustainability efforts to retrofit our stores with LED lighting, a chain-wide initiative which began in fiscal 2016 and will be completed in fiscal 2017.
916365_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	We also plan to invest in the initial development of a new northeast distribution center, expansion of our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, and an investment to improve our warehouse management system.
916365_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Additionally, we will continue to enhance our digital and omni-channel capabilities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	Financing activities used cash of $279.7 million , $180.6 million , and $340.5 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net borrowings under the senior credit facility, net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on stock options exercised.
916365_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is largely due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, as well as a year-over-year decrease in net borrowings under the senior credit facility and a reduced excess tax benefit recognized on stock options exercised.
916365_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is largely due to $150 million of net borrowings under the senior credit facility.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	On October 31, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to $3 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases and extended the program through December 31, 2020.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S2	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S3	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S4	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_17_ITEM7_P147_S5	The program may be limited or terminated at any time, without prior notice.
916365_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	We repurchased approximately 4.4 million , 3.4 million and 4.7 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $331.7 million , $292.7 million and $298.5 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $1.2 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.

916365_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	We paid dividends totaling $122.3 million , $103.1 million and $84.1 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our senior credit facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity through the end of fiscal 2017.
916365_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

916365_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	At December 31, 2016 , there were $44.3 million outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases.
916365_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
916365_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.
916365_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.
916365_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.
916365_17_ITEM7_P157_S2	Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances.
916365_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which implemented a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09.
916365_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	As a result of the deferral, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
916365_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
916365_17_ITEM7_P158_S3	In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which further clarifies the aspects of (a) identifying performance obligations and (b) the licensing implementation guidance.

916365_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	This update requires an entity that determines the cost of inventory by methods other than last-in, first-out and the retail inventory method to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
916365_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	ASU 2015-11 requires prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.

916365_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	This update simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments.
916365_17_ITEM7_P165_S2	The amendments in ASU 2016-15 require an entity to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
916365_17_ITEM7_P165_S3	The entity must also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
916365_17_ITEM7_P165_S4	The entity must present, separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.

916365_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
916365_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	This update requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.
916365_17_ITEM7_P168_S2	Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition.
916365_17_ITEM7_P168_S3	This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.

916365_17_ITEM7_P171_S1	The update addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation transactions including: (a) income tax consequences when awards vest or are settled, (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, (c) a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis and (d) classification of excess tax impacts on the statement of cash flows.

916365_17_ITEM7_P171_S5	The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards are exercised or settled.
916365_17_ITEM7_P171_S6	The Company does not expect the impact to be material to the consolidated results of operations taken as a whole; however, such determination is subject to change based on facts and circumstances at the time when awards vest or settle.
916365_17_ITEM7_P171_S7	The Company will elect to continue estimating forfeitures of share-based awards.
916365_17_ITEM7_P171_S8	The Company will elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using a retrospective transition method, and as a result, excess tax benefits related to share-based awards which are currently classified as cash flows from financing activities will be reclassified as cash flows from operating activities.
916365_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
916365_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	This update clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by U.S. GAAP and thereby reduces the current and potential future diversity in practice.
916365_17_ITEM7_P172_S2	This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
916365_17_ITEM7_P172_S3	The guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
916365_17_ITEM7_P172_S4	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
916365_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
916365_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	This update simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires the comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM7_P173_S2	Instead, under the amendments in this guidance, an entity shall perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount and an impairment charge is to be recorded for the amount, if any, in which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
916365_17_ITEM7_P173_S3	This guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for public business entities that are United States Securities and Exchange Commission filers for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of borrowings under our senior credit facilities (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which bear interest based on variable rates.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective March 31, 2016, which is intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As a result of this interest rate swap, our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2016.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The interest rate swap agreement has been executed for risk management purposes and is not held for trading purposes.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swap would have affected interest expense by approximately $1.5 million, $1.1 million, and $0.7 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014, respectively.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	On a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt, in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swap, existing as of December 31, 2016, would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately $0.9 million per year.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility, principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2016 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Tractor Supply Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria .

916365_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
916365_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
916365_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
916365_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
916365_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
916365_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

916365_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States.
916365_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	At December 31, 2016 , the Company operated a total of 1,738 retail stores in 49 states ( 1,595 Tractor Supply and Del s retail stores and 143 Petsense retail stores) and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com .
916365_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company adopted accounting guidance which affected the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets as discussed in Note 15.
916365_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	This guidance was applied retrospectively for all periods presented and therefore, the presentation of previously reported deferred tax assets has been changed to conform to the presentation used in the current period.
916365_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of deferred tax assets of $ 46.0 million from current assets to noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	The fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company has established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e. - an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on the Company s aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Shrinkage The Company performs physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months, and the Company has established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Vendor Funding The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen, reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Certain of the Company s agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory, and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on the Company s current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Freight The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.
916365_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	For self-insured employee medical claims, we have a stop loss limit of $300,000 per person per year.
916365_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	Our deductible or self-insured retention, as applicable, for each claim involving workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance is limited to $500,000 and our Texas Work Injury Policy is limited to $750,000 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P32_S4	Further, we maintain a commercially reasonable umbrella/excess policy that covers liabilities in excess of the primary insurance policy limits.
916365_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
916365_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant change in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the Company s financial results.
916365_17_ITEM8_P33_S3	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of $54.3 million compared to $51.2 million at December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of the Company s sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company s compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	The business activities of the Company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex tax compliance environment.
916365_17_ITEM8_P34_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company s sales tax compliance.
916365_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.
916365_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Tax Contingencies The Company s income tax returns are periodically audited by United States federal and state tax authorities.
916365_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S4	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S5	The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P43_S6	If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
916365_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
916365_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process.
916365_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both.
916365_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
916365_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
916365_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	If the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Impairment charges are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company s special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.
916365_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
916365_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	These taxes and fees are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had a liability of $4.2 million reserved for sales returns compared to $3.3 million at December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company recognized breakage income of $1.9 million , $1.6 million and $0.9 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution facilities, from distribution facilities to retail stores, and from one distribution facility to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or net realizable value, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution facility and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio, digital and social media offerings and other promotions.
916365_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were approximately $84.2 million , $73.9 million and $70.4 million , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $2.1 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Costs incurred at the Company s distribution facilities for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	Distribution facility costs including depreciation for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were approximately $166.8 million , $145.4 million and $121.1 million , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Pre-opening Costs Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $9.9 million , $9.6 million and $8.9 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) to most employees that work at least 20 hours per week.
916365_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company s stock option awards.
916365_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company relies on a blended volatility approach, weighting historical volatility trends and implied volatility, to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	The expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company s historical experience for similar options.
916365_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The fair value of the Company s restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company s common stock the day preceding the grant date, discounted for the expected dividend yield over the term of the award.
916365_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution facility and corporate assets.
916365_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	Dilutive shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Sales generated through the Company s private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables, trade payables, debt instruments and an interest rate swap.
916365_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.
916365_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company had $275.0 million in borrowings under the senior credit facility (as discussed in Note 5) at December 31, 2016 , and $150.0 million in borrowings as of December 26, 2015 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	Based on current market interest rates (Level 2 inputs), the carrying value of our borrowings under the senior credit facility approximates fair value for each period reported.
916365_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using forward rate curves (a Level 2 input).
916365_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	As described in further detail in Note 6, the fair value of the interest rate swap, excluding accrued interest, is a $2.8 million asset at December 31, 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	The interest rate swap did not have a fair value at December 26, 2015 , as it was not in place at that date as described in Note 6.
916365_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards for such instruments and hedging activities, which require that all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
916365_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges.
916365_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
916365_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
916365_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge a certain portion of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply the hedge accounting standards.
916365_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company entered into agreements with various governmental entities in the states of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee to implement tax abatement plans related to its distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County), its distribution center in Macon, Georgia (Bibb County) and its Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee (Williamson County).
916365_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P92_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 31, 2016 :
916365_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Computer software consists primarily of third-party software purchased for internal use.
916365_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_17_ITEM8_P95_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.
916365_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to the results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the lease term.
916365_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs, including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the applicable lease term.
916365_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under the Company s ESPP.
916365_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company s share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately 3.8 million shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Share-based compensation expense, including changes in expense for modifications of awards, was $23.6 million , $19.4 million and $16.2 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	Under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to current or prospective officers or employees, non-employee directors and consultants.
916365_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Company uses a blended volatility approach, weighting (i) actual historical changes in the market value of the stock at 75% and (ii) average implied volatility using tradable option data at 25% .
916365_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	To derive implied volatility, the Company relies on publicly traded options, with maturities of six months or greater.
916365_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	The Company believes this blended calculation of historical and expected price volatility provides the most relevant indicator of future volatility.
916365_17_ITEM8_P109_S2	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	This is the United States Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested.
916365_17_ITEM8_P112_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_17_ITEM8_P112_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.
916365_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Company issues shares for options when exercised.
916365_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	A summary of stock option activity is as follows:
916365_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total difference between the Company s closing stock price at each year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at each year-end.
916365_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $21.3 million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.7 years.
916365_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	There were no material modifications to options in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .

916365_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company issues shares for restricted stock unit awards once vesting occurs and related restrictions lapse.
916365_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	The units vest over a one to four year term; some plan participants have elected to defer receipt of shares of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock units, and as a result, shares are not issued until a later date.
916365_17_ITEM8_P119_S2	The status of restricted stock units is presented below:
916365_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	Other information relative to restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands):
916365_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld by the Company for the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, which the Company pays on behalf of its employees.
916365_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	The Company issued 48,267 , 72,206 , and 134,964 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P121_S2	Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.
916365_17_ITEM8_P121_S3	The amounts are net of 10,236 , 35,342 , and 77,192 shares withheld to satisfy $0.8 million , $3.0 million , and $4.8 million of employees tax obligations during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	There were no material modifications to restricted stock units in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .

916365_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Note 3 - Acquisition of Petsense:
916365_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	On September 29, 2016 , the Company completed the acquisition of Petsense.
916365_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Petsense is a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-size communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services.
916365_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	Pursuant to the agreement governing the transaction, the Company acquired all the outstanding equity interests in Petsense for an all-cash purchase price of $145.7 million .
916365_17_ITEM8_P127_S3	The acquisition was financed with cash-on-hand and revolver borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5).
916365_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	The total consideration transferred in connection with the Petsense acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.
916365_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is estimated based on one or a combination of income, cost or market approaches as determined based on the nature of the asset or liability and the level of inputs available.
916365_17_ITEM8_P128_S2	With respect to assets and liabilities, the determination of fair value requires management to make subjective judgments as to projections of future operating performance, the appropriate discount rate to apply, long-term growth rates, etc. (i.e. - unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy) which affect the amounts recorded in the purchase price allocation.
916365_17_ITEM8_P128_S3	The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, net of liabilities, is recorded as goodwill, which is indicative of the expected continued growth and development of the pet specialty retail business acquired.
916365_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The table below summarizes the consideration transferred and provisional allocation of the purchase price for the Petsense acquisition (in thousands):
916365_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	The fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the table above are subject to adjustments during the measurement period.
916365_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	The preliminary values of the consideration transferred, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the related tax effects, are subject to receipt of a final working capital settlement, pursuant to the agreement governing the transaction.
916365_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	The resulting goodwill of $ 84.2 million and tradename of $ 31.3 million are deductible for income tax purposes.
916365_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Approximately $ 2.8 million of transaction costs related to the Petsense acquisition were expensed during the year ended December 31, 2016 , and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The results of operations of Petsense have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.
916365_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
916365_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company had approximately $ 94.4 million and $10.3 million of goodwill at December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 , respectively.
916365_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
916365_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	Goodwill is allocated to each identified reporting unit, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.
916365_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process.
916365_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
916365_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.
916365_17_ITEM8_P139_S3	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	The Company determined that the fair value of each reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the respective reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.
916365_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of each reporting unit was determined based on either a market or an income approach.
916365_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.
916365_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	Approximately $ 31.3 million of intangible assets other than goodwill were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
916365_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	The acquired intangible asset represents the estimated fair value of the Petsense tradename, which is not subject to amortization as it has an indefinite useful life on the basis that it is expected to contribute cash flows beyond the foreseeable horizon.
916365_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	With respect to intangible assets, we evaluate for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_17_ITEM8_P143_S1	We recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its discounted cash flows and measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value.
916365_17_ITEM8_P143_S2	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of intangible assets and no impairment was identified.
916365_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	Note 5 - Senior Credit Facility:

916365_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	Both ratios are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).
916365_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	The fixed charge coverage ratio shall be greater than or equal to 2.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	The leverage ratio compares rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six plus total debt to consolidated EBITDAR.
916365_17_ITEM8_P153_S1	The leverage ratio shall be less than or equal to 4.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
916365_17_ITEM8_P153_S2	The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.
916365_17_ITEM8_P153_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

916365_17_ITEM8_P156_S1	The interest rate swap was executed for risk management and is not held for trading purposes.
916365_17_ITEM8_P156_S2	The objective of the interest rate swap is to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates.
916365_17_ITEM8_P156_S3	To accomplish this objective, the interest rate swap is intended to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the variable rate term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_17_ITEM8_P156_S4	The notional amount of the interest rate swap began at $197.5 million (the principal amount of the term loan borrowings as of March 31, 2016) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the term loan borrowings as described in Note 5.
916365_17_ITEM8_P156_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , the notional amount of the interest rate swap was $190.0 million .
916365_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	The interest rate swap entitles the Company to receive, at specified intervals, a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR in exchange for the payment of a fixed rate of interest throughout the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
916365_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and will account for the underlying activity in accordance with hedge accounting.

916365_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	In accordance with the underlying interest rate swap agreement, the Company could be declared in default on its interest rate swap obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness (i.e. - the Company s term loan) is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on such indebtedness.
916365_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	If the Company had breached any of the provisions in the underlying agreement at December 31, 2016 , it could have been required to post full collateral or settle its obligations under the interest rate swap agreement.
916365_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	However, as of December 31, 2016 , the Company had not breached any of these provisions or posted any collateral related to the underlying interest rate swap agreement.

916365_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) organizing, optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills, talent and leadership across the organization, and (2) implementing operational efficiency initiatives to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.
916365_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.2% .
916365_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	We plan to open approximately 80 new Tractor Supply and 20 new Petsense stores in fiscal 2018 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 5.0% .
916365_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	In fiscal 2016, we opened 113 new Tractor Supply stores and began operating 143 Petsense stores.
916365_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	This represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 6.3% during fiscal 2017 and 10.8% during fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	At December 30, 2017 , we operated 1,853 retail stores in 49 states ( 1,685 Tractor Supply and Del s retail stores and 168 Petsense retail stores).
916365_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets.
916365_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 800 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores.
916365_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	Approximately 40% of our Tractor Supply stores are in freestanding buildings and 60% are located in strip shopping centers.

916365_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	We operate in a competitive retail industry.
916365_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The principal competitive factors include location of stores, fulfillment options, price, quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, product knowledge and customer service.
916365_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.
916365_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	See further discussion of competition in 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.
916365_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.
916365_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
916365_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.
916365_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, enacted or adopted, regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S5	These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, LED lighting, high efficiency heating/air conditioning systems in our stores, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution facilities and the Store Support Center.
916365_18_ITEM1_P48_S6	Our Store Support Center, opened in 2014, and our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, opened in 2015, were each awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification for environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation.

916365_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, data privacy, and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers, increased presence of online retailers, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as diesel fuel and transportation services.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	While extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects, they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Capital required for growth may not be available.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The construction or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In the past, our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our access to funds under our debt facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members, increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety and immigration, among others.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multi-state employer.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the target business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While the Company selects these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	U.S. quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The current political landscape in the U.S. has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and Central America.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, or products at a desired price, resulting in lower sales and profitability.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities and expand existing facilities to support our growth objectives.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to personal injury, workers compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We maintain general liability and workers compensation insurance with a self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers or landlords indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Compliance with these laws, including the remediation of any alleged violation, may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We receive certain personal and other confidential information about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, our online operations at TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While we maintain substantial security measures to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cybersecurity attacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain and misuse the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	It is possible that such a compromise could go undetected by us.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including, but not limited to, human error, cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, fire, flood, power outages, telecommunication failures, facility or equipment damage, natural disasters, terrorism, and war.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Additionally, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omni-channel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Omni-channel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand our management information systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion through December 2020, we may discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce repurchases under the program.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts or investors expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	That multiple is in part dependent on investors perception of the Company s future earnings growth prospects.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If investor perceptions of the Company s earnings growth prospects change, the Company s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributors, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health, including, for example, regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail sector s compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform, changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), as well as state and local taxing authorities.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.
916365_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.
916365_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 30, 2017 , the Company operated 1,853 stores in 49 states.
916365_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company leases approximately 93% of its stores.
916365_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Store leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 15 years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at our option.
916365_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	No single lease is material to Company operations.
916365_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following is a count of store locations by state:
916365_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	The following is a list of distribution locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:
916365_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	(a) The leased facility in Hagerstown is treated as an extension of the existing owned Hagerstown location and is not considered a separate distribution center.
916365_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	(b) This is a mixing center designed to process certain high-volume bulk products.
916365_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Company s Store Support Center occupies approximately 260,000 square feet of owned building space in Brentwood, Tennessee, and the Company s Merchandising Innovation Center occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of leased building space in Nashville, Tennessee.
916365_18_ITEM2_P4_S1	The Company also leases approximately 8,000 square feet of building space for the Petsense corporate headquarters located in Scottsdale, Arizona.
916365_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	In fiscal 2017, we began construction on a new northeast distribution center in Frankfort, New York, as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed.
916365_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol, TSCO.
916365_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market for each fiscal quarter of the periods indicated:
916365_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 2, 2018, the number of record holders of our common stock was 585 (excluding individual participants in nominee security position listings), and the estimated number of beneficial holders of our common stock was approximately 200,000.
916365_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	During 2017 and 2016 , the Company s Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:
916365_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition and capital needs of the Company, as well as other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	On February 7, 2018 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share of the Company s common stock.
916365_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 13, 2018 , to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2018 .
916365_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through December 31, 2020 .
916365_18_ITEM5_P6_S1	Additionally, the Company withholds shares from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
916365_18_ITEM5_P6_S2	Stock purchase activity during fiscal 2017 is set forth in the table below:
916365_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	The total number of shares purchased and average price paid per share include shares withheld from vested restricted stock units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements of 8,998 during the first quarter, 2,199 during the third quarter and 558 during the fourth quarter.
916365_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.
916365_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions.
916365_18_ITEM5_P10_S0	Any additional stock repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
916365_18_ITEM5_P10_S1	The program may be limited or terminated at any time, without prior notice.
916365_18_ITEM5_P11_S0	This performance graph shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Tractor Supply Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
916365_18_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock from December 29, 2012 to December 30, 2017 (the Company s fiscal year-end), with the cumulative total returns of the S P 500 Index and the S P Retail Index over the same period.
916365_18_ITEM5_P12_S1	The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 29, 2012 , in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and in each case assumes reinvestment of dividends.
916365_18_ITEM5_P13_S0	The historical stock price performance shown on this graph is not indicative of future performance.
916365_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods ended and as of the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):
916365_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fiscal year 2016 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years presented consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S2	(b) Beginning in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of Petsense, unless otherwise noted.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S3	(c) Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S4	Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S5	(d) Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S6	Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S7	This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S8	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S9	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_18_ITEM6_P2_S10	Acquired Petsense stores are considered comparable stores beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	(e) New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.
916365_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	(f) Assumes average inventory cost, excluding inventory in-transit.
916365_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	(g) Working capital for 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflects deferred tax assets as non-current as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17 (which is discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
916365_18_ITEM6_P3_S3	Years prior to 2015 have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this guidance.
916365_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	(h) Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company s debt facilities and capital lease obligations, excluding the current portions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 30, 2017 (our fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ).
916365_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
916365_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
916365_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Tractor Supply reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
916365_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Tractor Supply also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results.
916365_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP.
916365_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Therefore, Tractor Supply s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
916365_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
916365_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States ( U.S. ).
916365_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	As of December 30, 2017 , we operated 1,853 retail stores in 49 states under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del s Feed Farm Supply and Petsense.
916365_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	We also operate websites under the names TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com .
916365_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:
916365_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.
916365_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Tractor Supply believes we can grow our business by being the most dependable supplier of relevant products and services for the Out Here lifestyle, creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences and providing convenience that our customers expect at anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose.
916365_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our long-term growth strategy is to: (1) drive profitable growth through new store openings and by expanding omni-channel capabilities, thus tying together our website product content, social media, digital and online shopping experience, attracting new customers and driving loyalty, (2) build customer-centric engagement by leveraging analytics to deliver legendary customer service, seasoned advice and personalized experiences, (3) offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to introduce new products through our test and learn strategy, (4) enhance our core and foundational capabilities by investing in infrastructure and process improvements which will support growth, scale and agility while improving the customer experience, and (5) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.
916365_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) organizing, optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills, talent and leadership across the organization, and (2) implementing operational efficiency initiatives to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 1,176 stores at the end of 2012 to 1,853 stores ( 1,685 Tractor Supply and Del s retail stores and 168 Petsense retail stores) at the end of fiscal 2017 , and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.2% .
916365_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.
916365_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 800 additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores.
916365_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores.
916365_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	In 2017 , we opened 101 new Tractor Supply stores in 39 states and 25 new Petsense stores in 11 states.
916365_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	In 2016, we opened 113 new Tractor Supply stores and began operating 143 Petsense stores.
916365_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	This resulted in a selling square footage increase of approximately 6.3% in fiscal 2017 and approximately 10.8% in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales increased 7.0% to $7.26 billion in fiscal 2017 (52 weeks) from $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 (53 weeks).
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Comparable store sales increased 2.7% in fiscal 2017 versus a 1.6% increase in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Gross profit increased 7.2% to $2.49 billion in fiscal 2017 from $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 , and gross margin remained flat to prior year at 34.3% as a percentage of net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	Operating income decreased 80 basis points to 9.4% of net sales in fiscal 2017 from 10.2% of net sales in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	For fiscal 2017, net income was $422.6 million, or $3.30 per diluted share, compared to $437.1 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016.
916365_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company s net deferred tax asset resulting in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $4.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was $427.5 million, or $3.33 per diluted share.
916365_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We ended the year with $109.1 million in cash and outstanding debt of $426.1 million, after returning $503.2 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.
916365_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
916365_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
916365_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.
916365_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
916365_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
916365_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.
916365_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	We have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment.
916365_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.
916365_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	A 10% change in our impairment reserve as of December 30, 2017, would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We perform physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months, and we have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies.
916365_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.
916365_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve as of December 30, 2017, would have affected net income by approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen , reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory, and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support and volume rebates is estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectability.
916365_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor funding reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.
916365_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor funding.
916365_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We do not believe there is a significant collectability risk related to vendor funding amounts due to us at the end of fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor funding due as of December 30, 2017, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor funding, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.
916365_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 30, 2017, net income would have been affected by approximately $7.8 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves:
916365_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.
916365_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Provisions for losses related to our self-insured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors.
916365_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.
916365_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves as of December 30, 2017, would have affected net income by approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based.
916365_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex tax compliance environment.
916365_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance.
916365_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	When establishing our sales tax audit reserve, we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk as well as our historical experience with each respective state.
916365_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.
916365_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve as of December 30, 2017, would have affected net income by approximately $0.9 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Tax Contingencies:
916365_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized.
916365_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
916365_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
916365_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve as of December 30, 2017, would have affected net income by approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
916365_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
916365_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss.
916365_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values.
916365_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses.
916365_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.
916365_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:
916365_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
916365_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
916365_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.
916365_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	The quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations, for the amount, if any, in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
916365_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both.
916365_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
916365_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
916365_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	If the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting prospective financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
916365_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty.
916365_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to non-cash impairment losses that could be material.
916365_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2017 and 2016 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	(a) Comparable store metrics are calculated using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	Closed stores are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Stores relocated during the periods being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S4	Acquired Petsense stores are considered comparable stores beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P84_S5	(b) Beginning in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of Petsense, unless otherwise noted.
916365_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	(a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others (like our Company) exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
916365_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Net sales increased 7.0% to $7.26 billion in fiscal 2017 from $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The prior year included an extra sales week as a part of the Company s 53-week calendar in 2016, which negatively impacted the overall sales increase by approximately 1.6 percentage points.
916365_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2017 were $6.85 billion , a 2.7% increase over fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	This compares to a 1.6% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The comparable store transaction count increased 2.2% and comparable store average ticket increased 0.5% for fiscal 2017 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	Stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	Acquired Petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of consumable, usable and edible ("C.U.E.") products, primarily animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	Warmer than normal weather patterns early in the first quarter negatively impacted the sales of winter seasonal items and winter storms in March had an unfavorable impact on the start to the spring selling season.
916365_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Beginning in the second quarter, we experienced broad-based improvement through the remainder of the year in all geographic regions and major product categories driven by strength in sales of everyday basic items in C.U.E. and year-round products.
916365_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	The third quarter experienced an additional benefit from an extended spring and summer selling season and strong sales of emergency response products related to hurricanes during the quarter while the fourth quarter experienced an additional benefit from solid sales in cold weather and other seasonal products.
916365_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017 , sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were $405.0 million in fiscal 2017 , which represented 6.0 percentage points of the 7.0% increase over fiscal 2016 net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were $378.9 million in fiscal 2016 , which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 8.9% increase over fiscal 2015 net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2017 and 2016 :
916365_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2017 and 2016 :
916365_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gross profit increased 7.2% to $2.49 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a percent of net sales, gross margin remained flat to prior year at 34.3% .
916365_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	Gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by higher markdowns on cold weather merchandise and targeted promotional activity in the first quarter, as well as a higher freight expense throughout the year due to higher carrier costs, increased average fuel costs and a shift in product mix towards more freight intensive products.
916365_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	These declines in gross margin were offset by strong sell-through rates and solid price and inventory management, particularly in the back half of the year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Total selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2017 increased 10.7% to $1.81 billion from $1.63 billion in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	SG A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 80 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2017 from 24.1% in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	The increase in SG A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to higher store payroll from wage inflation and our continued effort to enhance customer service, increased incentive compensation at the store level from the strong year-over-year growth in comparable store sales, the deleverage of occupancy and other fixed costs resulting from the integration of Petsense expenses and the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017, and investments in infrastructure and technology to support our strategic long-term growth initiatives.
916365_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our effective tax rate increased to 37.2% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Act ).
916365_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	We have made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Act on our existing deferred tax balances as of December 30, 2017, and recognized a provisional amount of $4.9 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P97_S3	However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances in future periods.
916365_18_ITEM7_P97_S4	Excluding the impacts of the Act, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 36.4%.
916365_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	For fiscal 2017 , net income was $422.6 million , or $3.30 per diluted share, compared to $437.1 million , or $3.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company s net deferred tax asset resulting in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $4.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was $427.5 million, or $3.33 per diluted share.
916365_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented.
916365_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	During fiscal 2017 , we repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $369.4 million as part of our $3 billion share repurchase program.
916365_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	In fiscal 2016 , we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares at a total cost of $331.7 million .
916365_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Net sales increased 8.9% to $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The fourth quarter included an extra sales week as a part of the Company s 53-week calendar in 2016, which represented 1.6 percentage points of the overall 8.9% sales increase over prior year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	Comparable store sales for fiscal 2016 were $6.41 billion, a 1.6% increase over fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	This compares to a 3.1% comparable store sales increase in the prior year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P100_S4	The comparable store transaction count increased 2.6%, while comparable store average ticket decreased 0.9% for fiscal 2016.
916365_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.
916365_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	Petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition.
916365_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of C.U.E. products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise.
916365_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Livestock equipment and hardline products such as fencing and trailers also performed well throughout the year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	The full year sales performance was negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns during the spring selling season and unseasonably warm weather in the key cold months of the year which drove softness in cold weather seasonal categories and big ticket items such as log splitters and stoves.
916365_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	Additionally, the Company believes that economic conditions in the energy producing markets negatively impacted consumer spending primarily in the Midwest and South Central regions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2016, sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were $378.9 million in fiscal 2016, which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 8.9% increase over fiscal 2015 net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	Sales from stores opened less than one year were $351.0 million in fiscal 2015, which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 9.0% increase over fiscal 2014 net sales.
916365_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	The following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2016 and 2015:
916365_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016 and 2015:
916365_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Gross profit increased 8.5% to $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	As a percent of net sales, gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 34.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 34.4% for fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	This decrease in gross margin percentage principally reflects a higher mix of C.U.E. products, which generally carry below chain average gross margin, partially offset by benefits from our key margin driving initiatives.
916365_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Freight expense as a percent of net sales experienced a marginal increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year due principally to an increase in inbound miles and domestic transportation costs, partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and import container costs.
916365_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 24.1% in fiscal 2016 from 24.0% in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	new distribution facilities that began operations in late fiscal 2015, as well as acquisition and operating expenses associated with the Petsense purchase.
916365_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	These increases were partially offset by leverage of occupancy costs from the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal 2016, as well as lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	Total SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2016 increased 9.3% to $1.63 billion from $1.49 billion in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The increase in SG A expenses primarily reflects new store growth, incremental costs from operating the new distribution facilities, variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth and the extra sales week during the year and incremental expenses associated with the Petsense acquisition and its operations.
916365_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due principally to the availability of federal and state tax incentives.
916365_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2016 increased 6.5% to $437.1 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $410.4 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, in fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of $331.7 million as part of our $3 billion share repurchase program.
916365_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	In fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at a total cost of $292.7 million.
916365_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our guidance for fiscal 2018 anticipates net sales of $7.69 billion to $7.77 billion, reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 2.0% to 3.0% as well as the opening of approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores and 20 Petsense stores.
916365_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	At the mid-point of our guidance range, we anticipate that operating profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease from 9.4% in fiscal 2017 to 8.8% in fiscal 2018.
916365_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	Included in this estimate are anticipated cost pressures associated with rising diesel fuel prices and transportation costs, wage investments for our team members in our stores and distribution centers, investments to support our growth strategy, and incremental pre-opening and other operating expenses from our new distribution center which is currently under construction in Frankfort, New York.
916365_18_ITEM7_P114_S3	Lastly, as a result of the Act reducing the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is expected to range from 23.0% to 23.5%.
916365_18_ITEM7_P114_S4	As a result of the foregoing factors, we estimate net income for fiscal 2018 of $490 million to $515 million, or $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share.
916365_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution facility capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities, share repurchases, cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.
916365_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, remaining funds available under our debt facilities, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.
916365_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our debt facilities, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity, through the end of fiscal 2018.
916365_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	At December 30, 2017 , the Company had working capital of $806.2 million , which increased $65.6 million from December 31, 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):
916365_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	In comparison to December 31, 2016 , working capital as of December 30, 2017 was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash, inventory and accounts payable.
916365_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	The cash balance increased primarily due to strong inventory turns at the end of fiscal 2017 stemming from the sale of cold weather seasonal merchandise.
916365_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	The increase in inventory resulted from the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth.
916365_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.
916365_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	Average inventory per store decreased slightly year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
916365_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth along with timing of payments to vendors.

916365_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	The presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.
916365_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	The $19.2 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily reflects the timing of receipts and payments in relation to inventory and accounts payable partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to new store growth and investments in information technology and infrastructure.
916365_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	The $194.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015 was due to changes in the following (in millions):

916365_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	The $194.5 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflects incremental profitability and the impact of effective management of inventory and accounts payable levels.
916365_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	Average inventory per store decreased year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
916365_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	Additionally, the timing of payments to vendors more closely aligned with receipt of inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 in comparison with the end of fiscal 2015, resulting in an improvement in cash flow year-over-year.
916365_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	Investing activities used cash of $238.0 million , $369.3 million and $235.9 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

916365_18_ITEM7_P153_S2	Existing store expenditures were higher in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to the investment in the chain-wide LED lighting retrofit initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2017.
916365_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	The sustained increase in spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omni-channel platform, as well as improvements in security and compliance, enhancements to our customer relationship management database and other strategic initiatives.
916365_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Spending for distribution center capacity and improvements increased in fiscal 2017 as we began construction of a new northeast distribution center in Frankfort, New York, and expansion of our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska.

916365_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	Financing activities used cash of $338.3 million , $291.3 million and $207.6 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	The $47.0 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to changes in the following (in millions):
916365_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	(a) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows.
916365_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	The presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.
916365_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is largely due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, under our debt facilities.
916365_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The $83.7 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to changes in the following (in millions):
916365_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	(a) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows.
916365_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	The presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.
916365_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 is due to incremental share repurchases of common stock, fewer borrowings, net of repayments, under our debt facilities, and an increase in quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders.
916365_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through December 31, 2020 .
916365_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions.
916365_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.
916365_18_ITEM7_P165_S4	The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
916365_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	We repurchased approximately 5.9 million , 4.4 million and 3.4 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $369.4 million , $331.7 million and $292.7 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	As of December 30, 2017 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $0.9 billion , exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.
916365_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	We paid cash dividends totaling $133.8 million , $122.3 million and $103.1 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	In fiscal 2017 , we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of $1.05 per common share outstanding as compared to $0.92 and $0.76 per common share outstanding in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	These payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to $0.27 per share from $0.24 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to $0.24 per share from $0.20 per share.
916365_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition and capital needs of the Company, as well as other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.
916365_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2017 (in thousands):
916365_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	(a) Capital lease obligations include related interest.
916365_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	(b) Long-term debt obligations include an estimate of related interest after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements.
916365_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	See Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our interest rates.
916365_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	(c) Represents contractual commitments related to the ongoing construction of a new distribution center in Frankfort, New York, and the expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska.
916365_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	At December 30, 2017 , there were $39.6 million outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
916365_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed.
916365_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	We typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases.
916365_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs.
916365_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 30, 2017 .
916365_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2016 Senior Credit Facility (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which bear interest based on variable rates.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As a result of the interest rate swaps, our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately $2.1 million, $1.5 million, and $1.1 million in the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 26, 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 30, 2017, we have no outstanding variable rate debt other than the borrowings which are covered by interest rate swaps; therefore, on a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt, in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps, would result in no additional interest expense.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.
916365_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility, principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.
916365_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
916365_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
916365_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 30, 2017 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
916365_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, has issued a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
916365_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Tractor Supply Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
916365_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company s (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
916365_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 30, 2017, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
916365_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
916365_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with the respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
916365_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
916365_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
916365_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
916365_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
916365_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company (the Company) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 30, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
916365_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
916365_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
916365_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
916365_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
916365_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P14_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
916365_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2001.
916365_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements .
916365_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
916365_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company (the Company or we ) is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States ( U.S. ).
916365_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the Out Here lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
916365_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
916365_18_ITEM8_P21_S3	At December 30, 2017 , the Company operated a total of 1,853 retail stores in 49 states ( 1,685 Tractor Supply and Del s retail stores and 168 Petsense retail stores) and also offered a number of products online at TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com .
916365_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted accounting guidance which affected the presentation in the statement of cash flows of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options as discussed in Note 15.
916365_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company has elected to apply the amendments using a retrospective transition method for all periods presented and therefore the presentation of previously reported excess tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows has been changed to conform to the presentation used in the current period.
916365_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	As a result, $11.7 million and $27.0 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based awards which were previously classified as cash flows from financing activities have been reclassified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 , and December 26, 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Statement of Stockholders Equity is no longer impacted by the excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options.
916365_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.
916365_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	The fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 consisted of 52 weeks, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 consisted of 52 weeks.
916365_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
916365_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
916365_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.
916365_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
916365_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:
916365_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventory Impairment Risk The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.
916365_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company has established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on the Company s aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.
916365_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.
916365_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.
916365_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Shrinkage The Company performs physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months, and the Company has established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.
916365_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.
916365_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.
916365_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.
916365_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.
916365_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Vendor Funding The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ( vendor support ) and volume-based rebate funds ( volume rebates ).
916365_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are evergreen, reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.
916365_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Certain of the Company s agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product.
916365_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory, and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.
916365_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	During interim periods, the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.
916365_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on the Company s current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
916365_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.
916365_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Freight The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.
916365_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.
916365_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.
916365_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.
916365_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	For self-insured employee medical claims, we have a stop loss limit of $300,000 per person per year.
916365_18_ITEM8_P33_S3	Our deductible or self-insured retention, as applicable, for each claim involving workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance is limited to $500,000 and our Texas Work Injury Policy is limited to $750,000 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P33_S4	Further, we maintain a commercially reasonable umbrella/excess policy that covers liabilities in excess of the primary insurance policy limits.
916365_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.
916365_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
916365_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant change in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the Company s financial results.
916365_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	At December 30, 2017 , the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of $57.9 million compared to $54.3 million at December 31, 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of the Company s sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based .
916365_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.
916365_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company s compliance with applicable sales tax laws.
916365_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	The business activities of the Company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex tax compliance environment.
916365_18_ITEM8_P35_S4	These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company s sales tax compliance.
916365_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.
916365_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.
916365_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
916365_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.
916365_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Tax Contingencies The Company s income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
916365_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
916365_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.
916365_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company s various tax filing positions, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
916365_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.
916365_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
916365_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
916365_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
916365_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
916365_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.
916365_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
916365_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S5	The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P44_S6	If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis.
916365_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.
916365_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
916365_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
916365_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action.
916365_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.
916365_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations, for the amount, if any, in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both.
916365_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
916365_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
916365_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	If the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations.
916365_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Impairment charges are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.
916365_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company s special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.
916365_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental agency on a periodic basis.
916365_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	These taxes and fees are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.
916365_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.
916365_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.
916365_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.
916365_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	At December 30, 2017 , the Company had a liability of $3.8 million reserved for sales returns compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ).
916365_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.
916365_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company recognized breakage income of $2.4 million , $1.9 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution facilities, from distribution facilities to retail stores, from one distribution facility to another, and directly to our customers; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or net realizable value, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.
916365_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	SG A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution facility and corporate employees; share-based compensation expenses; occupancy costs of retail, distribution and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.
916365_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio, digital and social media offerings and other promotions.
916365_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.
916365_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	Advertising expenses for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were approximately $81.3 million , $84.2 million and $73.9 million , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $1.1 million and $2.1 million at December 30, 2017 , and December 31, 2016 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Costs incurred at the Company s distribution facilities for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.
916365_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	Distribution facility costs including depreciation for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were approximately $182.1 million , $166.8 million and $145.4 million , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.
916365_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	Pre-opening costs were approximately $10.8 million , $9.9 million and $9.6 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) to most employees that work at least 20 hours per week.
916365_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
916365_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
916365_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company s stock option awards.
916365_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.
916365_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company relies on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.
916365_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
916365_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	The expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company s historical experience for similar options.
916365_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.
916365_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The fair value of the Company s restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company s common stock the day preceding the grant date, discounted for the expected dividend yield over the term of the award.
916365_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.
916365_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.
916365_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution facility and corporate assets.
916365_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.
916365_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
916365_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.
916365_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.
916365_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
916365_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
916365_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
916365_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	Dilutive shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.
916365_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.
916365_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Sales generated through the Company s private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
916365_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.
916365_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
916365_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they generally settle within 24 - 48 hours.
916365_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
916365_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
916365_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables, trade payables, debt instruments and interest rate swaps.
916365_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.
916365_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	The Company had $427.5 million in borrowings under our debt facilities (as discussed in Note 5) at December 30, 2017 , and $275.0 million in borrowings as of December 31, 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	Based on current market interest rates (Level 2 inputs), the carrying value of our borrowings under our debt facilities approximates fair value for each period reported.
916365_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using forward rate curves (a Level 2 input).
916365_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	As described in further detail in Note 6, the fair value of the interest rate swaps, excluding accrued interest, was a $5.2 million asset at December 30, 2017 , and was a $2.8 million asset at December 31, 2016 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards for such instruments and hedging activities, which require that all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
916365_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges.
916365_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
916365_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
916365_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge a certain portion of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply the hedge accounting standards.
916365_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.
916365_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.
916365_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	Property and equipment are carried at cost.
916365_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
916365_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.
916365_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:
916365_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company entered into agreements with various governmental entities in the states of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee to implement tax abatement plans related to its distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County), its distribution center in Macon, Georgia (Bibb County), and its Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee (Williamson County).
916365_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.
916365_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	This property was then leased back to the Company.
916365_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.
916365_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.
916365_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus $1 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of December 30, 2017 :
916365_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction.
916365_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	The original cost of the Company s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.
916365_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.
916365_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Computer software consists of software developed for internal use and third-party software purchased for internal use.
916365_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software s functionality or extends its useful life.
916365_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
916365_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
916365_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.
916365_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.
916365_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	Store closing costs were not significant to the results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.
916365_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
916365_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	Certain operating leases include rent increases during the lease term.
916365_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.
916365_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.
916365_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs, including items reimbursed by landlords.
916365_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the applicable lease term.
916365_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under the Company s ESPP.
916365_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.
916365_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee s purchase price.
916365_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	There were no significant modifications to the Company s share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2017 .
916365_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	At December 30, 2017 , the Company had approximately 2.3 million shares available for future equity awards under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
916365_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Share-based compensation expense, including changes in expense for modifications of awards, was $29.2 million , $23.6 million and $19.4 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
916365_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Under the Company s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to current or prospective officers or employees, non-employee directors and consultants.
916365_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
916365_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.
916365_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.
916365_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
916365_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.
916365_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:
916365_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.
916365_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	The Company applies a historical volatility rate.
916365_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
916365_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	The Company believes the use of historical price volatility provides an appropriate indicator of future volatility.
916365_18_ITEM8_P106_S4	An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option.
916365_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
916365_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.
916365_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested.
916365_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	This estimate is based on historical experience.
916365_18_ITEM8_P109_S2	An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.
916365_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.

916365_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	Pursuant to the agreement governing the transaction, the Company acquired all the outstanding equity interests in Petsense for an all-cash purchase price which was financed with cash on-hand and revolver borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5).
916365_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The total consideration transferred in connection with the Petsense acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.
916365_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is estimated based on either one or a combination of the following methodologies: the income approach, the cost approach or the market approach as determined based on the nature of the asset or liability and the level of inputs available.
916365_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	With respect to assets and liabilities, the determination of fair value requires management to make subjective judgments as to projections of future operating performance, the appropriate discount rate to apply, long-term growth rates, etc. (i.e. unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy), which affect the amounts recorded in the purchase price allocation.
916365_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, net of liabilities, is recorded as goodwill, which is indicative of the expected continued growth and development of the pet specialty retail business acquired.

916365_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	As a result, the values of the consideration transferred, assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the table above are considered final.
916365_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	The working capital settlement reduced both the consideration transferred and goodwill by $1.2 million from the preliminary values.
916365_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The resulting goodwill of $ 82.9 million and tradename of $ 31.3 million are amortized for income tax purposes.

916365_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.
916365_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	The test used to identify the potential for goodwill impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	An impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations for the amount, if any, in which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
916365_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and no impairment was identified.
916365_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	The Company determined that the fair value of each reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the respective reporting unit.
916365_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of each reporting unit was determined based on either a market or an income approach.
916365_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data.
916365_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	The Company had approximately $ 31.3 million of intangible assets other than goodwill at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
