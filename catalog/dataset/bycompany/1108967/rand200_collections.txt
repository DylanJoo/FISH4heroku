1108967_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Losses from Operations; Accumulated Deficit; Negative Net worth and Going Concern.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, the Company has not generated sufficient revenues from operations to self-fund its capital and operating requirements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	These factors raise substantial doubt concerning its ability to continue as a going concern.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	However, following the acquisition of CUI, Inc. and subsequent reductions of debt, the company is generating significant revenues that it expects will provide the Company with the ability to self-fund its capital and operating requirements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	If that is not possible, the Company will seek additional working capital from funding that will primarily include equity and debt placements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company previously recorded extinguishments of debt as settlement gains subsequent to performing a thorough analysis of the relevant guidance.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Upon review by the SEC, it was determined that the Company should reclassify these extinguishments of debt as additional paid in capital and not as settlement gains as a result of the determination that a related party was involved.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Restatement of Prior Periods Financial Statements .
1108967_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative companies and technologies.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	From its GasPT2 platform targeting the energy sector, to its subsidiary CUI, Inc.'s industry leading digital power platform targeting the networking and telecom industries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	In May 2008, CUI Global formed a wholly owned subsidiary that acquired the assets of CUI, Inc., a technology company dedicated to the development, commercialization, and distribution of new, innovative electro-mechanical products.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Over the past 20 years, CUI has become a recognized name in electronic components worldwide in the areas of power, interconnect, motion control, and sound.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	In that time, the company has been able to leverage many long-standing relationships in Asia to create a flexible, responsive business model that ultimately benefits CUI customers.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	Today, its industry leading technology platforms which include Novum Advanced Power and AMT Capacitive Encoders are quickly positioning CUI, Inc. as a global leader in the fields of power electronics and motion control.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares representing an 11.544% interest in Test Products International, Inc., a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Effective July 1, 2009, CUI Global acquired CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments Ltd.) and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Both CUI Japan and Comex are Japanese based providers of DSP-based hardware and software that specializes in digital to analog and analog to digital test and measurement equipment.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	CUI Japan and Comex focus on applications that demand high speed multiple channel measurement.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	The product line ranges from 8 channel to 1032 channel systems.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Comex works primarily with research labs, universities, and large companies in Japan to create its custom solutions.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, the Comex acquisition provides a manufacturing component which allows CUI Global to manufacture some of its own products, such as the AMT encoder, in Japan.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results the Company will report in the Company's financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Some of the Company's accounting policies require the Company to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P14_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Each of these methods may produce a different result.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company estimates the patent applications it has filed will have a future beneficial value to the Company; thus, it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	At the time the patent is issued, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	If the patent is not issued, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	A change in the estimate of the patent having a future beneficial value to the Company will impact the other assets and expense accounts of the Company.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The recognition of the Company s revenues requires judgment, including whether a sale includes multiple elements and, if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	These elements could include licensing rights to manufacture and sell our proprietary patent protected products.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	The ability to identify VSOE for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company does not have any history as to the costs expected to be incurred in granting licensing rights relating to its products.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Therefore, revenues may be recorded that are not in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2010 are $612,275 and a net working capital deficit at December 31, 2010 of $675,936.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, operations and investment activities have been funded through cash from operations, proceeds from equity financings and borrowings from financial institutions.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company s operating requirements generated a positive cash flow from operations of $628,847 during 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	During 2010 and 2009, the Company has used stock and warrants as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants and employees.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	For 2010 and 2009, respectively, the Company recorded a total of $144,912 and $686,237 for compensation and services expense including amortization of deferred compensation related to equity given or to be given to employees and consultants for services provided.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	During 2009, the Company recorded five additional significant non-cash entries - $3,096,641 of non-cash interest expense, including amortization of the beneficial conversion value, amortization of debt offering costs, warrant related debt discounts and intrinsic value of convertible debt and amortization of debt discount, $210,403 of non-cash loss for the impairment of intangible , patent pending technology, $246,237 of non-cash loss for the impairment of intangible , customer list, $10,241,529 of non-cash loss for the impairment of goodwill, and $136,811 of non-cash loss for the impairment of patents.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	As the Company focuses on the technology development and product line additions during 2011, it will continue to fund research and development together with related sales and marketing efforts for its technology platforms including the GasPT2, Novum Advanced Power, AMT Capacitive Encoders, DSP and its other electromechanical products.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	During the years ended 2010 and 2009, the Company invested $361,990 and $265,858, respectively, in fixed assets.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2011 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company invested $7,230 and $25,355, respectively, in patent costs during 2010 and 2009.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company expects its investment in patent costs will continue throughout 2011 as it invests in patents to protect the rights to use its product and technology developments.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company invested $87,448 and $182,955, respectively in technology rights and development during 2010 and 2009.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company expects its investment in technology rights and development will continue throughout 2011 as it works to bring new technology and products to the market.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company invested $9,003 and $0, respectively in other intangible assets during 2010 and 2009.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	Terms of the acquisition called for three equal annual payments over three years to acquire the remaining 51% of Comex Electronics.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In accordance with the Company s charter, CUI Global maintains two of the three Comex Electronics board positions and therefore has effective control.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	The ASU will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	Early adoption is permitted, provided that the guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).
1108967_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P78_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-9, which amends the Subsequent Events Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to eliminate the requirement for public companies to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Company will continue to evaluate subsequent events through the date of the issuance of the financial statements; however, consistent with the guidance, this date will no longer be disclosed.

1108967_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	This update addresses the classification of a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	ASC 718 is amended to clarify that a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades shall not be considered to contain a market, performance, or service condition.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	Therefore, such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity classification.
1108967_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2010, and the Company is currently assessing the potential impact, if any, the adoption of this update may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

1108967_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 and identified the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The material weakness pertains to controls relating to the valuation of inventory and capitalization of costs for our developed technology at our 49% owned subsidiary Comex Electronics, Ltd.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Management has concluded that the above control deficiency represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P8_S2	As a result of the material weakness described above, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework.

1108967_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	There were no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Management has identified additional steps necessary to address the material weakness described above.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	These measures include the implementation of an enhanced financial software system for tracking inventory and capitalized costs as well as education of personnel regarding appropriate procedures and controls at our 49% owned subsidiary, Comex Electronics, Ltd. Management has begun implementation of these additional procedures and expects these material weaknesses to be resolved in 2011.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	The Company believes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all controls issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P13_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P13_S2	A copy of our Audit Committee Charter can be viewed on our website: www.cuiglobal.com.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P14_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_11_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

1108967_11_ITEM9B_P1_S0	Our Bylaws permit the number of directors to be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors, but to be no less than one.

1108967_11_ITEM9B_P66_S1	The Audit Committee has also considered whether the amount and nature of non-audit services provided by Webb Company, P.A. is compatible with the auditor s independence.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S0	The nominating committee consists of all of the members of the Board of Directors four of whom are "independent directors" within the meaning of Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S1	The nominating committee is responsible for the evaluation of nominees for election as director, the nomination of director candidates for election by the shareholders and evaluation of sitting directors.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S2	The Board has developed a formal policy for the identification or evaluation of nominees.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S3	In general, when the Board determines that expansion of the Board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the Board and management, consultation with the candidate's associates and through other means, a candidate's honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S4	The committee would review any special expertise, for example, that qualifies a person as an audit committee financial expert, membership or influence in a particular geographic or business target market, or other relevant business experience.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P67_S5	To date the Company has not paid any fee to any third party to identify or evaluate, or to assist it in identifying or evaluating, potential director candidates.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P68_S0	The nominating committee will consider director candidates nominated by shareholders during such times as the Company is actively considering obtaining new directors.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P68_S1	Candidates recommended by shareholders will be evaluated based on the same criteria described above.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P68_S2	Shareholders desiring to suggest a candidate for consideration should send a letter to the Company's Secretary and include: (a) a statement that the writer is a shareholder (providing evidence if the person's shares are held in street name) and is proposing a candidate for consideration; (b) the name and contact information for the candidate; (c) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (d) information regarding the candidate's qualifications to be director, including but not limited to an evaluation of the factors discussed above which the Board would consider in evaluating a candidate; (e) information regarding any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate; (f) information regarding potential conflicts of interest; and (g) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as director if nominated and elected.
1108967_11_ITEM9B_P68_S3	Because of the small size of the Company and the limited need to seek additional directors, there is no assurance that all shareholder proposed candidates will be fully considered, that all candidates will be considered equally, or that the proponent of any candidate or the proposed candidate will be contacted by the Company or the Board, and no undertaking to do so is implied by the willingness to consider candidates proposed by shareholders.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P0_S0	The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is appointed by the Board of Directors to discharge the Board's responsibilities with respect to all forms of compensation of the Company's executive officers, to administer the Company's equity incentive plans, and to produce an annual report on executive compensation for use in the Company's Form 10-K. The Compensation Committee consists of two members of the board of directors, Messers Colton Melby and Corey Lambrecht, both of whom are "independent directors" within the meaning of Rule 4200(a) (15) of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	The Compensation Committee discharges the Board s responsibilities relating to general compensation policies and practices and to compensation of our executives.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	In discharging its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee establishes principles and procedures in order to ensure to the Board and the shareholders that the compensation practices of the Company are appropriately designed and implemented to attract, retain and reward high quality executives, and are in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P1_S2	In this context, the Compensation Committee s authority, duties and responsibilities are to:
1108967_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	Annually review the Company s philosophy regarding executive compensation.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	Periodically review market and industry data to assess the Company s competitive position, and to retain any compensation consultant to be used to assist in the evaluation of directors and executive officers compensation.

1108967_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	Establish and approve incentive levels and targets relevant to compensation of the executive officers.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	Annually review and make recommendations to the Board to approve, for all principal executives and officers, the base and incentive compensation, taking into consideration the judgment and recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer for the compensation of the principal executives and officers.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	Separately review, determine and approve the Chief Executive Officer s applicable compensation levels based on the Committee s evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of the Company s and the individual goals and objectives.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	Periodically review and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the compensation of directors, including board and committee retainers, meeting fees, equity-based compensation and such other forms of compensation as the Compensation Committee may consider appropriate.

1108967_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	Review and discuss with management, the Compensation Disclosure and Analysis (CD A), and determine the Committee s recommendation for the CD A s inclusion in the Company s annual report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our Compensation Committee meets formally an informally as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Compensation Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P13_S1	On an as requested basis, our Compensation Committee receives and reviews materials prepared by management, consultants or committee members, in advance of each meeting.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P13_S2	Depending on the agenda for the particular meeting, these materials may include:
1108967_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	Reports and executive compensation summary worksheets, which sets forth for each executive officer: current total compensation and incentive compensation target percentages, current equity ownership holdings and general partner ownership interest, and current and projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from, over a five year period.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders, and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P15_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package, and internal pay equity.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P15_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P16_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P17_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals, and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P18_S0	Long term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P18_S1	These shares/units generally vest over a two to four year period.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P18_S2	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long term strategic goals.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P19_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P19_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P20_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P21_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P21_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_11_ITEM11_P22_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P23_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P23_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P23_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, for the Board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P23_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the Board of Directors.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P24_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P24_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P24_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company, and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P25_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management at the Company s annual board meeting.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P25_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving same.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P26_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P26_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P26_S2	In 2010, these non financial performance goals and objectives included achieving accurate financial reporting and timely SEC filings; demonstrating full compliance and superior performance in the Company s environmental, health and safety practices; performing appropriate SOX/404 remediation activities and achieving successful testing of and compliance with SOX requirements and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P27_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual company performance relative to the targets as well as on individual performance, and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P27_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally at the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the Board of Directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P27_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P28_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P29_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P30_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P31_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P32_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P33_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P33_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P34_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P34_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: 1) the Company s EBIDA; 2) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and 3) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P35_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P35_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P35_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management's proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P35_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P36_S0	Incentive awards are paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P37_S0	Annual Board of Directors meetings based on actual company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P38_S0	In many instances the award of restricted common stock vests over a four year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P38_S1	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price, of no less than, the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P38_S2	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P39_S0	Our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc., maintains a 401(k) plan.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P40_S0	The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute to the plan after they have completed 3 months of service and are 21 years of age.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P40_S1	The Company matches the employee s contribution up to 6% of total compensation.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P40_S2	Total employer contributions, net of forfeitures, were $156,317 and $153,996, for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P41_S0	Our executives are not awarded any type of protection upon a change in control unless specifically provided in an employment contract.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P42_S0	The Company does not provide for any perquisites or any other benefits for its senior executives that are not generally available to all employees.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P43_S0	On January 5, 2009 the Company Board of Directors received and approved a written report and recommendations of the Compensation Committee which included a detailed executive equity compensation report and market analysis and recommendations of Compensia, Inc., a management consulting firm that provides executive compensation advisory services to compensation committees and senior management of knowledge-based companies.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P43_S1	The Compensation Committee used the report and analysis as a basis for its formal written recommendation to the board.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P44_S0	Pursuant to a January 8, 2009 board resolution, the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (Executive), a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, was created and funded with 4,200,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P44_S1	The Compensation Committee was appointed as the Plan Administrator to manage the plan.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P45_S0	October 11, 2010, CUI Global authorized an additional 3,060,382 options under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (Executive).
1108967_11_ITEM11_P46_S0	The 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (Executive) provides for the issuance of Incentive Non Statutory Options to attract, retain and motivate executive and management employees and directors and to encourage these individuals to acquire an equity interest in the Company, to make monetary payments to certain management employees and directors based upon the value of the Company s stock and to provide these individuals with an incentive to maximize the success of the Company and further the interest of the shareholders.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P46_S1	The Administrator of the plan is authorized to determine the exercise price per share at the time the option is granted, but under the terms of the 2009 Plan, the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P46_S2	Stock options granted under the 2009 Plan have a maximum duration of 10 years.

1108967_11_ITEM11_P62_S0	The Compensation Committee concluded that, after giving consideration to the directors obligation in representation of the shareholders, the high standard of ethics and talent required, increasing workloads, greater exposure, more stringent director independence standards and the SEC's disclosure rules, directors and committee members should be compensated fairly for time and value delivered and the compensation should be sufficient to attract and retain qualified competent individuals to serve on our board.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P63_S0	The Compensation Committee adopted the recommendations of Compensia and approved a director and committee compensation plan.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P64_S0	The Compensation Committee concluded that the appropriate compensation for calendar year 2009 should be in the form of options granted in an amount equal to the 50 th percentile for similar companies, but discounted by a factor of 10% at an option strike price of $0.25 per share.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P64_S1	This price reflected the true value of the directors work, provides adequate incentive to each director and does not unfairly penalize the directors for current market conditions.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P64_S2	Moreover, the $0.25 strike price reflects the price at which much of the underlying funding and CUI transaction was originally priced.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P65_S0	In keeping with this original compensation structure, the Compensation Committee concluded that the appropriate compensation for calendar year 2010 should continue to be in the form of options granted in an amount equal to the 50 th percentile for similar companies, but discounted by a factor of 10% at an option strike price of $0.30 per share.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P65_S1	In furtherance of this compensation plan, October 11, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 3,060,382 options under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (Executive) of which 99,000 options were granted to each director of the Company with an exercise price of $0.30 per share and that vest one year after the October 11, 2010 date of grant.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P65_S2	The $0.30 option price reflects a stock price fair to both the director and the Company.
1108967_11_ITEM11_P65_S3	The 2010 director compensation plan, in summary, provides:
1108967_11_ITEM11_P66_S0	Annual Option to purchase 99,000 common shares at a price of $0.30 per share.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. (formerly known as Waytronx, Inc.) and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (Restated), and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the two years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (Restated).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of CUI Global, Inc. (formerly known as Waytronx, Inc.) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (Restated) and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (Restated) in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $7,015,896, a working capital deficiency of $675,936 and an accumulated deficit of $73,596,738 at December 31, 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P16_S2	These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P16_S3	Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 1.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P16_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Effective May 16, 2008, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Waytronx Holdings, Inc., to acquire the assets of CUI, Inc., a Tualatin, Oregon based provider of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	The wholly owned subsidiary was renamed CUI, Inc. following the close of the acquisition.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing a 11.544% and 10.47% interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively) in Test Products International, Inc., a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Through CUI s capabilities and extensive contacts throughout Asia, this acquisition allows CUI Global to continue to identify, acquire and commercialize new proprietary technologies.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	CUI Global will use CUI s market partners and global distribution capabilities to bring other products to market, including the Digital Power Modules, GASPT2 and other proprietary devices, described below.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	CUI s testing and R D capabilities allow CUI Global to commercialize and prototype its products more efficiently and economically.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	CUI defines its product into three categories: components including connectors, speakers and buzzers; control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions known as V-Infinity.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries ranging from consumer electronics to defense and alternative energy.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Effective July 1, 2009, CUI Global acquired CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments, Ltd.) and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd. that includes an associated distribution network.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Both companies are Japanese based DSP providers of digital to analog and analog to digital test and measurement systems and electronic components for OEM research and development.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	These acquisitions provide a manufacturing component which allows CUI Global to manufacture some of its own products, such as the AMT encoder in Japan.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that CUI Global will continue as a going concern.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	As reflected in these financial statements, we had a consolidated net loss of $7,015,896 and an accumulated deficit of $73,596,738 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to bring additional technologies and products to market, generate increased sales, obtain positive cash flow from operations and raise additional capital.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	If necessary, we will continue to raise additional capital to provide sufficient cash to meet the funding required to develop and commercialize our technology product lines.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	As we continue to expand and develop technology and product lines, additional funding may be required.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	There have been negative cash flows from operations and incurred net losses in the past and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which additional financing and capital might be available if needed.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	Significant estimates in 2010 and 2009 include estimates used to review the Company s long-lived assets for impairment, inventory valuation, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2010 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan and 49% owned Comex Electronics for the full year.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	The consolidated financial statements for 2009 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary CUI, Inc. for the full year, and the partial year results of its wholly owned subsidiary CUI Japan and 49% owned Comex Electronics since acquisition on July 1, 2009.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company previously recorded extinguishments of debt as settlement gains subsequent to performing a thorough analysis of the relevant guidance.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Upon review by the SEC, it was determined that the Company should reclassify these extinguishments of debt as additional paid in capital and not as settlement gains as a result of the determination that a related party was involved.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of its receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The cost of furniture, equipment and software is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	TPI is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	The Company also has a demand receivable from TPI of $190,240 as of December 31, 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	CUI Global enjoys a close association with this affiliate through common Board of Director membership and participation, that allows for a significant amount of influence over affiliate business decisions.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, the Company accounts for its investment in this affiliated entity under the equity method.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	A summary of the unaudited financial statements of the affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P71_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company estimates the patents it has filed have a future beneficial value; therefore it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	At the time the patent is approved, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	If the patent is not approved, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	A change in the estimate of the patent having a future beneficial value will impact the other assets and expense accounts.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	During the years ended 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $418,185 and $136,811 related to capitalized patents.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	No. 815 ( FASB ASC 815 ), Derivatives and Hedging , which requires a periodic valuation of the fair value of derivative instruments and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of shares of common stock is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as other expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as other expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	Any subsequent increase or decrease in the fair value of the derivative liabilities is recognized as other expense or other income, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	The reclassification of a contract is reassessed at each balance sheet date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	If a contract is reclassified from permanent equity to an asset or a liability, the change in the fair value of the contract during the period the contract was classified as equity is accounted for as an adjustment to equity.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	If a contract is reclassified from an asset or liability to equity, gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that contract was classified as an asset or a liability are not reversed but instead are accounted for as an adjustment to equity.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation .
1108967_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P77_S2	The statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	Employee stock compensation is recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes Pricing Model.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	The underlying assumptions used in the Black Scholes Pricing Model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including, volatility is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance, the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted, appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website and other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	See Note 14, for additional disclosure and discussion of the employee stock plan and activity.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	Common stock, stock options and common stock warrants issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value, as required by FASB ASC 505, which is measured as of the date required by FASB ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees .
1108967_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 505, the stock options or common stock warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the valuation date, which for options and warrants related to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non-performance is the date of the contract, and for all other contracts is the vesting date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	Expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	Where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date, the expense is computed under the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the end of the period, and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The recognition of revenues requires judgment, including whether a sale includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Customers receive certain elements of CUI Global products over a period of time.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	These elements include licensing rights to manufacture and sell our proprietary patent protected products.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	The ability to identify VSOE for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	CUI Global does not have any history as to the costs expected to be incurred in granting licensing rights relating to its products.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	Therefore, revenues may be recorded that are not in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	Revenues in connection with electronic devices, component, and test and measurement equipment are recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer, collectability is reasonably assumed, the price is fixed and determinable and persuasive evidence of arrangement exists.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	Amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are included in sales, and were $72,378 and $103,733 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company expenses inbound shipping and handling costs as cost of revenues.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	A warranty reserve liability is recorded based on estimates of future costs on sales recognized.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	The costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are charged to operations as incurred.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $575,490 and $544,146, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	No. 740 ( FASB ASC 740 ), Income Taxes .
1108967_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	Under FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P89_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	Valuation allowances have been established against deferred tax assets due to uncertainties in the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to make realization of such assets more likely than not.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	An income tax benefit has not been recognized for its operating losses generated during 2010 and 2009 based on uncertainties concerning the ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	There was no income tax receivable at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P90_S3	In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	No. 260 ( FASB ASC 260 ), Earnings Per Share , basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	Common equivalent shares outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, which consist of options, warrants, convertible notes and convertible preferred stock, have been excluded from the diluted net loss per common share calculations because they are anti-dilutive.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	Accordingly, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for 2010 and 2009.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	The following table summarizes the potential common stock shares at December 31, 2010 and 2009, which may dilute future earnings per share.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	The financial statements of the Company's foreign offices have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters (FASB ASC 830).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	Income statement amounts have been translated using an appropriately weighted average exchange rate for the year.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	The translation gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange rates during 2010 and 2009 have been reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, except for gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany receivables and payables, which are included in earnings for the period.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., CUI Japan and Comex Electronics, CUI Global now has operating segments to report.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	The Company has identified five operating segments based on the products offered.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P94_S2	The five segments are External Power, Internal Power, Industrial Controls, Comex/CUI Japan and Other.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	The External Power segment is focused primarily on sales of external power supplies and related components.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Internal Power segment is focused primarily on sales of internal power supplies and related components.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Industrial Controls segment is focused primarily on sales of encoding devices and related components.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P95_S3	The Comex/CUI Japan segment is focused on the sales of Comex and CUI Japan products.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P95_S4	The Other category represents activity of segments that do not meet the threshold for segment reporting and are combined.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following information is presented for the year ended December 31, 2010 for operating segment activity:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	The following information is presented for the year ended December 31, 2009 for operating segment activity (the Comex (Japan) activity began on the date of acquisition July 1, 2009):
1108967_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	Only the Comex / CUI Japan and Other operating segments hold assets individually.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	The External Power, Internal Power and Industrial Controls operating segments do not hold assets individually as segment assets as they utilize the Company assets held in the Other segment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	Certain amounts from prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2009-13, which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	The ASU significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P100_S2	The ASU will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P100_S3	Early adoption is permitted, provided that the guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P100_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2009-13 to have any effect on its financial statements upon its required adoption on January 1, 2011.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P101_S2	Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P101_S3	The guidance became effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for the Company with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P101_S4	Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-9, which amends the Subsequent Events Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to eliminate the requirement for public companies to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Company will continue to evaluate subsequent events through the date of the issuance of the financial statements; however, consistent with the guidance, this date will no longer be disclosed.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P102_S2	ASU 2010-09 does not have any impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-13 Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Trades as codified in ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ).
1108967_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	This update addresses the classification of a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	ASC 718 is amended to clarify that a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades shall not be considered to contain a market, performance, or service condition.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P103_S3	Therefore, such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity classification.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P103_S4	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2010, and the Company is currently assessing the potential impact, if any, the adoption of this update may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	July 1, 2009, CUI Global acquired CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments Ltd.) and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	The Purchase Price reflects the acquisition of 100% of CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments Ltd.) and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	The total purchase price is approximately $260,000.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P104_S3	Terms of the acquisition called for three equal annual payments over three years to acquire the remaining 51% of Comex Electronics.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P104_S4	The terms of acquisition have been amended to allow CUI Global to acquire the remaining 51% at anytime during the five years following the initial acquisition.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	In accordance with the Company s charter, CUI Global maintains two of the three Comex Electronics board positions and therefore has effective control.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	The following details the initial acquisition of CUI Japan and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd.:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	The table below summarizes the unaudited pro forma information of the results of operations as though the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2009:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	Property and equipment is summarized as follows at December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $509,007 and $413,117, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI Inc., the Company obtained $51,222 in technology rights related to a proprietary internal power supply produce line.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	During 2010, the Company capitalized $70,000 of technology rights related to power technologies and $17,448 related to DSP technologies.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P112_S1	Also during 2010, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3,105,956 related to WayCool technology rights.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The technology rights are amortized over the twenty-year estimated life of the technology, unless a shorter life is deemed appropriate by management based on the life expectancy of the related technology.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	The technology rights balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:
1108967_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	Amortization of technology rights during 2010 and 2009 was $262,788 and $238,998, respectively.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	The estimated annual amortization expense related to existing technology rights as of December 31, 2010 is expected to be $268,510 in 2011, $268,510 in 2012, $52,974 in 2013 and $29,998 in 2014.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P114_S2	Management has evaluated the technology rights for impairment and believes no additional impairment expense related to technology rights exists at December 31, 2010.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	During the last three quarters of 2006 through 2008, the Company privately placed approximately $3,450,000 of 12% promissory notes.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	$1,650,000 ($650,000 of this amount has been repaid and $1,000,000 was converted to common stock leaving $0 principal balance remaining at December 31, 2010) of these notes are convertible to common stock at a per share price equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average closing bid price of one share of Company common stock for 10 days preceding the Conversion Date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S2	There was, however, a $0.20 per share minimum limit on the conversion price, which limited the number of shares that the company would be obligated to issue.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S3	However, in April 2010 in conjunction with other debt reduction initiatives, the Company agreed with the convertible note holder to convert the remaining $1,000,000 of principal and related accrued interest at $0.1056 per share of common stock based on 80% of the average closing price of one share of Company common stock for the 10 days preceding the conversion date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S4	Additionally, each investor in the convertible promissory notes were issued a warrant to purchase at any time within three (3) years following the date of investment, at a per share price of one cent ($0.01), that number of shares of CUI Global, Inc. common stock as is equal in value to one tenth the principal investment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S5	Such value to be determined by the average per share closing bid price of CUI Global, Inc. common stock for the 10 days preceding the date of investment.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S6	Of the remaining $1,800,000 notes, $700,000 ($450,000 of this amount has been repaid and $250,000 was converted to common stock leaving $0 principal balance remaining at December 31, 2010) of these notes were convertible to common stock at a per share price of $0.25.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S7	Also in April 2010, in conjunction with the conversion of the $1,000,000 convertible note previously discussed, $250,000 of this principal balance and related accrued interest was converted to common stock under the same terms of $0.1056 per share of common stock based on 80% of the average closing price of one share of Company common stock for the 10 days preceding the conversion date.
1108967_11_ITEM15_P115_S8	The remaining $1,100,000 ($493,674 of this amount has been repaid, $100,000 was converted to common stock and $25,000 was recorded as additional paid in capital was recorded related to the debt settlement of $25,000 of the promissory note leaving $481,326 of principal balance remaining at December 31, 2010) were not convertible.

1108967_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	An income tax benefit has not been recognized for operating losses generated in prior periods based on uncertainties concerning the ability to generate taxable income in future periods.

1108967_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	Once acquired, we assign a team of engineers, market specialists and sales executives to implement our commercialization strategy.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	That end-to-end strategy incorporates everything from branding, to market/product surveys, to identification of appropriate market partners and more.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our current power line, V-Infinity, consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue and recent revenue growth.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We have developed the first fully featured digital point of load dc-dc converter in the power market under our Novum Advanced Power line of products.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	This product is a next generation product targeted at the intermediate bus power architecture that is prolifically used in the telecom and networking communications market.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	In September of 2010 we released full production versions of two point of load modules.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We were finalists for the prestigious Golden Mousetrap Award and EDN Innovation Award for these parts in 2010.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	With the shift towards smarter, smaller and greener power requirements, engineers are seeking innovative solutions that allow them to keep pace with lower core voltages, faster transient response needs and increasing thermal issues that they face in their designs.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our recently introduced Novum NDM2 modules, with a full suite of digital features, specifically address these growing system complexities through intelligent power management.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	The NDM2 series is the first to be designed by the company as part of the Ericsson cooperation announced in July.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	The agreement formalizes a plan between the two companies to offer a multi-source digital POL platform based on the BMR46X series, with future plans to co-develop modules outside the existing range of 10~50A. We have also developed a middle ground product to ease the customer base into the benefits of digital in power.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P13_S4	We developed a smart module that allows for the benefits of digital in the design cycle but when installed functions like a highly optimized analog unit.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Initial traction for this product has been quite positive.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc .
1108967_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The company entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One s Digital Power Technology patents.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	The license provides access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into the company s new line of digital point of load power modules.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The company, through its power division, also manufactures a wide range of embedded and external power electronics devices for OEM manufacturers.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a proprietary patented power topology for designing unique power circuits.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	This topology allows for higher efficiencies, densities, response time and price competitiveness that is otherwise unavailable.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our initial product designed using this topology is in the quarter brick dc-dc converter market.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Solus is an entirely new topology, rich in features that accelerate the performance trend trajectories for the big-four power conversion needs in the telecom and server markets: greater efficiency; higher power density; reduced EMI (electro-magnetic interference); and faster transient response (4 times as fast).
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	We have introduced the NQB2060 Novum quarter-brick bus converter as a prime example of the benchmark 720 watts output power performance using the Solus Topology.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S5	Since the Solus Topology maintains it effectiveness independent of the control method used, it can operate with analog voltage mode control, analog current mode control and various digital control profiles.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S6	We believe that unique feature opens the door for the company to implement this topology in a wide variety of power supply product platforms.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P18_S7	We also believe that this topology will allow for at least a decade of new product designs and introductions.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	As large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, our unique Solus Topology and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The company entered into an exclusive Field of Use Agreement with California Power Research to license their BPS-5 topology, now marketed as the Solus Topology.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	This topology provides industry leading efficiencies and densities in power design.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	The topology is broadly applicable to both DC-DC and AC-DC products.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	This will allow for the company to have a long roadmap of industry leading products to service its broad customer base.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	In addition, its first target is the Intermediate Bus Architecture (IBA) where the Digital POL modules are used.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Vergence natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT2, is a low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as double the price of the GasPT2.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	This licensing contract with GL Industrial Services ( GL ) anticipates between $35,000,000 and $40,000,000 in sales during the first four years of the agreement.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	According to our review, the market studies commissioned by GL and GL's experience in the natural gas industry all demonstrate that these contract numbers are conservative and achievable.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	In 2011, the Company reached agreements with several European and US companies to place beta test units for both laboratory and infield testing.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	These companies included SNAM RETE in Italy; National Grid in the United Kingdom; and GASUNIE in The Netherlands among others.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	In early 2012, the company began the delivery of beta units to North American companies for their own beta test programs.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In addition, we signed an exclusive 3-year distribution agreement for the United Kingdom with Orbital, the largest specialty gas engineering company in England.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	In conjunction with Orbital, we have introduced the combined Vergence GasPT2 unit and Vergence V-Probe to National Grid the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	In January 2012 we entered into a second three (3) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our Vergence technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our Vergence GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	The agreement calls for sales of as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units and is valued from $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 over the three-year term.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	We plan to replicate this type of agreement with other large, regional gas engineering companies in North America.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We are also in negotiations with several large Middle Eastern organizations to place the device in the Gulf Region.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The company has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as opposed to optical or magnetic encoding.

1108967_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributor with partnership marketing.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	These areas however need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S4	The expansion means more manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P42_S5	We intend to eventually have field application engineers in the strategic areas driving designs at the customers facility.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our specific product offering ranges from audio jacks to industrial power supplies.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	While the bulk of our business is in power (ac-dc and dc-dc) products, we have a broad line of electromechanical components for the OEM manufacturer.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	Because the electromechanical technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, we thrive on being flexible within the industry through our product offering and in how we conduct business.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	The primary focus areas for growth, however, are in engineering and in sales.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	Our products are supported on our website and the products with the highest amount of turnover are stocked and marketed in distribution centers.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S5	We strive to create collaborative relationships with our customers, seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P43_S6	We invest in our future and the future of our customers through new technologies, talented employees, expanded manufacturing capabilities and a growing global reach.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our Vergence GasPT2 Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device, the GasPT2.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our strategy for GasPT2 has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our sale or return sales approach has been accepted very positively in Europe and the United States.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	Our approach focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States in 2011.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	For 2012, the Company will continue its efforts in those areas and also begin the process of taking GasPT2 to the Asian markets, with India identified as the test market.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P44_S5	Beyond this we have a strategy which is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	In addition, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement for the UK with Orbital, the largest specialty gas engineering company in England.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	In conjunction with Orbital, we have introduced the combined Vergence GasPT2 unit and Vergence V-Probe to National Grid the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	We recently entered into a second three (3) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our Vergence technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our Vergence GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P45_S4	The agreement calls for sales of as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units and is valued from $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 over the three-year term.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	We plan to replicate this type of agreement with other large, regional gas engineering companies in North America and we are negotiating with several large Middle Eastern groups to place the device in the Gulf Region.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. (GIA), the global GC market will reach more than $1.5 billion by 2015.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Admittedly, that market is mature and, according to GIA, is dominated by aftermarket and accessories sales.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	In contrast, the Vergence Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	It provides almost real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	Taking all of those factors into account, it is likely that the Vergence Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $1.5 billion market.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in the form of technology and potential strategic partners.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, most especially in the power industry, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including Vergence, Novum and Solus.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	Moreover, much like CUI, Inc. when we acquired it, there are many small, well-run electronics companies that become available due to the age or desires of their founders.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P48_S4	We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies between any potential acquisition and our current business, along with the potential for increased revenue and/or market share.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Research and development costs for CUI Global were $716,321 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $740,396 for the same period during 2010.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs and the Solus Topology, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the Vergence GasPT2.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	The Company expects that research and development expenses will increase during 2012 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company, together with its consolidating subsidiaries, had fifty-seven full-time and four part-time employees.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	None of its employees is represented by a labor union.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	The Company plans to add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained the relationship with the holder of the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Through an exclusive licensing contract with AnderMotion Technologies LLC, signed on or about April 20, 2009, CUI acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute motion control devices utilizing the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Through a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Power-One, Inc., signed on or about September 18, 2009, CUI has access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into CUI s new line of digital point of load (POL) power modules.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with California Power Research, Inc., signed on or about March 4, 2010, CUI acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture, market, sell, lease, maintain, give over and dispose of licensed product using the BPS-5 advanced power topology technology.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., signed on or about January 4, 2010, CUI Global acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT2) designed by GL on a worldwide basis.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products and services.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Company retained Hartman and Hartman, P. C., Banner Witcoff, Ltd. and Law Offices of William W. Haefliger to manage its current interests relative to the prosecution of the national and international patents.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Company intends to pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	In an effort to concentrate our business focus on our core product development and marketing, in December 2011, we conveyed our WayCool and WayFast patent portfolio to Olantra Fund X LLC for a cash payment of $500,000.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under the Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, the United States Patent and Trademark Office permitted our registration of the following trademarks: RediAlert, Rapid Dispatch Emergency Signs, RediAd, Living Window, OnScreen Technology, CUI INC, CUI Europe, V-Infinity, AMT, Novum, CUI Global and Simple Digital.

1108967_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up to date protection of its intellectual property.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The industries in which the company competes are very broad.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	We operate a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitiveness of pricing to differentiate our products from competitors.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of large global firms.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	We feel that our electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have a very strong retail distribution partner that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a $700 encoder all different products for different customers.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Additionally, we utilize third party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new and better customers otherwise not readily available to the company.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	CUI is becoming more recognized in the power supply market and have differentiated ourselves through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	As of December 31, 2011, our internal and external power segments sales account for approximately 89% of our revenues.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	We have added new products and technologies that will allow us to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	From the first full featured digital point-of-load dc-dc converter, to the highly dense intermediate bus converters that CUI is releasing, we believe that we are ahead of the market leaders in our market space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	We feel that there is a market shift to a digitally-based controller for power supply switching.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	It is our strategy that this will be a complete transformation for the industry as it will become a major part of the value sell to the end customer as well as a data collection point for energy consumption, two important elements for the industry.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Similarly, the Vergence natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT2, competes in a mature industry with established competitors.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	CUI s Vergence GasPT2 is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to its best competition.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S2	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S3	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S4	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P70_S5	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as double the price of the GasPT2.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	The licensing contract with GL Industrial Services ( GL ) anticipates between $35,000,000 and $40,000,000 in sales during the first four years of the agreement.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	According to our review, the market studies commissioned by GL and GL's experience in the natural gas industry all demonstrate that these contract numbers are conservative and achievable.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	During 2011, the Company reached agreements with several European and US companies to place beta test units for both laboratory and infield testing.
1108967_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	In early 2012, the company began the delivery of beta units to North American companies for their own beta test programs.

1108967_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, the Company has not generated sufficient revenues from operations to self-fund its capital and operating requirements.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Following the equity raise closed in early 2012 and subsequent reductions of debt coupled with the continued improvement in the Company s operations, management believes the company has sufficient resources and that it is generating significant revenues that it expects will provide the Company with the ability to self-fund its capital and operating requirements.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	If that is not possible, the Company will seek additional working capital from funding that will primarily include equity and debt placements.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative companies and technologies.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	From its GasPT2 platform targeting the energy sector, to its subsidiary CUI, Inc.'s industry leading digital power platform targeting the networking and telecom industries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	In May 2008, CUI Global formed a wholly owned subsidiary that acquired the assets of CUI, Inc., a technology company dedicated to the development, commercialization, and distribution of new, innovative electro-mechanical products.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Over the past 20 years, CUI has become a recognized name in electronic components worldwide in the areas of power, interconnect, motion control, and sound.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	In that time, the company has been able to leverage many long-standing relationships in Asia to create a flexible, responsive business model that ultimately benefits CUI customers.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Today, its industry leading technology platforms which include Novum Advanced Power, Solus Power Topology and AMT Capacitive Encoders are quickly positioning CUI, Inc. as a global leader in the fields of power electronics and motion control.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares representing an 11.54% interest in Test Products International, Inc., a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Effective July 1, 2009, CUI Global acquired CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments Ltd.) and 49% of Comex Electronics Ltd.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	CUI Japan test and measurement systems and electronic components and Comex Instruments is a DSP provider of digital to analog and analog to digital test and measurement systems for OEM research and development.

1108967_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	As such, the operations of Comex Electronics are reported as discontinued operations for the current and comparable periods.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Company recognized a gain on divestment of Comex Electronics of $603,034.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	CUI Global will continue to maintain its 100% ownership of CUI Japan.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results the Company will report in the Company's financial statements.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Some of the Company's accounting policies require the Company to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Each of these methods may produce a different result.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company estimates the patent applications it has filed will have a future beneficial value to the Company; thus, it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	At the time the patent is issued, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	If the patent is not issued, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	A change in the estimate of the patent having a future beneficial value to the Company will impact the other assets and expense accounts of the Company.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The recognition of the Company s revenues requires judgment, including whether a sale includes multiple elements and, if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	These elements could include licensing rights to manufacture and sell our proprietary patent protected products.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	The ability to identify VSOE for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company does not have any history as to the costs expected to be incurred in granting licensing rights relating to its products.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Therefore, revenues may be recorded that are not in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2011 are $176,775 and a net working capital deficit at December 31, 2011 of $960,177.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, operations and investment activities have been funded through cash from operations, proceeds from exercises of options, and borrowings from financial institutions and an officer of the company.

1108967_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	This improvement is primarily the result of a lower net loss in 2011, a gain on the sale of technology rights, a decrease in trade accounts receivable, a decrease in inventory, increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets, increased accounts payable, decreased accrued expenses and decreases in accrued compensation.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company has used stock and warrants as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants and employees.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	For 2011 and 2010, respectively, the Company recorded a total of $227,867 and $144,912 for compensation and services expense including amortization of deferred compensation related to equity given or to be given to employees and consultants for services provided.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	During 2011, CUI Global recorded one significant non-cash entry - $334,747 of non-cash interest expense, including amortization of debt offering costs.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	During 2010, the Company recorded three significant non-cash entries - $3,859,342 of non-cash interest expense, including amortization of the beneficial conversion value, amortization of debt offering costs, warrant related debt discounts and intrinsic value of convertible debt and amortization of debt discount, $3,105,956 for the impairment of technology rights and $418,185 of non-cash loss for the impairment of patents.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company had positive cash flow from discontinued operations of $22,141 and $78,295, respectively.
1108967_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	As the Company continues to focus on technology development and product line additions during 2012, it will continue to fund research and development together with related sales and marketing efforts for its technology platforms including the Vergence GasPT2, Novum Advanced Power, Solus Power Topology, AMT Capacitive Encoders, and its other electromechanical products.

1108967_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1108967_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
1108967_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
1108967_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
1108967_12_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

1108967_12_ITEM10_P52_S1	The nominating committee is responsible for the evaluation of nominees for election as director, the nomination of director candidates for election by the shareholders and evaluation of sitting directors.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P52_S2	The Board has developed a formal policy for the identification or evaluation of nominees.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P52_S3	In general, when the Board determines that expansion of the Board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the Board and management, consultation with the candidate's associates and through other means, a candidate's honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P52_S4	The committee would review any special expertise, for example, that qualifies a person as an audit committee financial expert, membership or influence in a particular geographic or business target market, or other relevant business experience.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P52_S5	To date the Company has not paid any fee to any third party to identify or evaluate, or to assist it in identifying or evaluating, potential director candidates.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P53_S0	The nominating committee will consider director candidates nominated by shareholders during such times as the Company is actively considering obtaining new directors.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P53_S1	Candidates recommended by shareholders will be evaluated based on the same criteria described above.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P53_S2	Shareholders desiring to suggest a candidate for consideration should send a letter to the Company's Secretary and include: (a) a statement that the writer is a shareholder (providing evidence if the person's shares are held in street name) and is proposing a candidate for consideration; (b) the name and contact information for the candidate; (c) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (d) information regarding the candidate's qualifications to be director, including but not limited to an evaluation of the factors discussed above which the Board would consider in evaluating a candidate; (e) information regarding any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate; (f) information regarding potential conflicts of interest; and (g) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as director if nominated and elected.
1108967_12_ITEM10_P53_S3	Because of the small size of the Company and the limited need to seek additional directors, there is no assurance that all shareholder proposed candidates will be fully considered, that all candidates will be considered equally, or that the proponent of any candidate or the proposed candidate will be contacted by the Company or the Board, and no undertaking to do so is implied by the willingness to consider candidates proposed by shareholders.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P0_S0	The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is appointed by the Board of Directors to discharge the Board's responsibilities with respect to all forms of compensation of the Company's executive officers, to administer the Company's equity incentive plans and to produce an annual report on executive compensation for use in the Company's Form 10-K.

1108967_12_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our Compensation Committee meets formally an informally as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Compensation Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2011.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P13_S1	On an as requested basis, our Compensation Committee receives and reviews materials prepared by management, consultants or committee members, in advance of each meeting.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P13_S2	Depending on the agenda for the particular meeting, these materials may include:
1108967_12_ITEM11_P14_S0	Reports and executive compensation summary worksheets, which sets forth for each executive officer: current total compensation and incentive compensation target percentages, current equity ownership holdings and general partner ownership interest and current and projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from, over a five year period.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P15_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P15_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P15_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P16_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P16_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P17_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P17_S1	Long term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P17_S2	These shares/units generally vest over a two to four year period.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P17_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long term strategic goals.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P18_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P18_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P19_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P20_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P20_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_12_ITEM11_P21_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P22_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P22_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P22_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, for the Board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P22_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the Board of Directors.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P23_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P23_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P23_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P24_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management at the Company s annual board meeting.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P24_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving same.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P25_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P25_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P25_S2	In 2011, these non financial performance goals and objectives included achieving accurate financial reporting and timely SEC filings; demonstrating full compliance and superior performance in the Company s environmental, health and safety practices; performing appropriate SOX/404 remediation activities and achieving successful testing of and compliance with SOX requirements and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P25_S3	In addition, the executive team was charged with positioning the company for up-listing to a national stock exchange and a possible equity raise in early 2012.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P25_S4	Said funding to be used to enhance the company s balance sheet; pay down corporate debt; increase the company s ability to rapidly bring its new products to market; and other appropriate matters.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P26_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual company performance relative to the targets as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P26_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally at the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the Board of Directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P26_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P27_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P28_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P29_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P30_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P31_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P32_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P32_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P33_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P33_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: 1) the Company s EBIDTA; 2) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and 3) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P34_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P34_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P34_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management's proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P34_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P35_S0	Incentive awards are paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P36_S0	Annual Board of Directors meetings based on actual company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P37_S0	In many instances the award of restricted common stock vests over a four year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P37_S1	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price, of no less than, the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P37_S2	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P38_S0	Our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc., maintains a 401(k) plan.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P39_S0	The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute to the plan after they have completed 3 months of service and are 21 years of age.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P39_S1	The Company matches the employee s contribution up to 6% of total compensation.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P39_S2	Total employer contributions, net of forfeitures, were $179,234 and $156,317, for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P40_S0	Our executives are awarded protection upon a change in control as specifically provided in their employment contracts.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P41_S0	The Company does not provide for any perquisites or any other benefits for its senior executives that are not generally available to all employees.
1108967_12_ITEM11_P42_S0	Our Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.cuiglobal.com.

1108967_12_ITEM11_P59_S0	The Compensation Committee concluded that, after giving consideration to the directors obligation in representation of the shareholders, the high standard of ethics and talent required, increasing workloads, greater exposure, more stringent director independence standards and the SEC's disclosure rules, directors and committee members should be compensated fairly for time and value delivered and the compensation should be sufficient to attract and retain qualified competent individuals to serve on our board.

1108967_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive gain and loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the two years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P18_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of CUI Global, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Effective May 16, 2008, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Waytronx Holdings, Inc., to acquire the assets of CUI, Inc., a Tualatin, Oregon based provider of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	The wholly owned subsidiary was renamed CUI, Inc. following the close of the acquisition.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P21_S2	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing a 11.54% interest at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively) in Test Products International, Inc., a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Through CUI s capabilities and extensive contacts throughout Asia, this acquisition allows CUI Global to continue to identify, acquire and commercialize new proprietary technologies.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	CUI Global will use CUI s market partners and global distribution capabilities to bring other products to market, including the Digital Power Modules, GASPT2 and other proprietary devices, described below.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	CUI s testing and R D capabilities allow CUI Global to commercialize and prototype its products more efficiently and economically.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	CUI defines its products into three categories: electronic components including connectors, speakers, buzzers and control solutions including encoders and sensors; power solutions known as V-Infinity and test and measurement including the Vergence GasPT2 .
1108967_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories as well as test and measurement capabilities to industries ranging from consumer electronics to defense and alternative energy.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	In July 2009 CUI Global acquired, as a wholly owned subsidiary, Comex Instruments, Ltd., now known as CUI Japan and 49% of Comex Electronics, Ltd.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Both companies are Japanese based providers of electronic components.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	Effective July 1, 2011, CUI Global entered into an agreement to convey its 49% ownership interest in Comex Electronics to the owners of the remaining 51% who are the original founders and were the original owners of Comex Instruments, for $617,975 in the form of a five year note receivable bearing interest at 4% per annum.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P26_S3	The operations of CUI Japan are not affected by this divestment.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	Significant estimates in 2011 and 2010 include estimates used to review the Company s long-lived assets for impairment, inventory valuation, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2011 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan for the full year as well as the discontinued operations of Comex Electronics through June 30, 2011.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	The consolidated financial statements for 2010 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan and the discontinued operations of Comex Electronics for the full year.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	No. 825 ( FASB ASC 825 ), Financial Instruments , requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, deferred compensation and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2011 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no cash balances at financial institutions which were in excess of the FDIC insured limits.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	However, at December 31, 2011 the Company held $71,995 in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $62,664 in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	At December 31, 2010, the Company held $142,952 in European foreign bank accounts and $20,383 in Japanese foreign bank accounts.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with the revenue derived from product sales.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $125,000 and $125,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is considered adequate.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	The reserve in both periods takes into account aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of its receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Inventories consist of finished and un-finished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market; using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010 inventory is valued, net of allowances, at $3,563,111 and $3,735,641, respectively.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	The allowances for inventory were $240,000 and $164,005 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Furniture, equipment and software are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	When furniture and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	The cost of furniture, equipment and software is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	The estimated useful lives and accumulated depreciation for furniture, equipment and software are as follows:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets related to those assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	If the non-discounted future cash flows of the enterprise are less than their carrying amount, their carrying amounts are reduced to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	During 2010, the Company recorded impairment expense of $3,105,956 related to technology rights and $418,185 related to patents.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	There were no impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2011.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.

1108967_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Technology rights are amortized over a twenty year life and are reviewed for impairment annually.

1108967_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing a 11.54% interest at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively) in Test Products International, Inc., hereafter referred to as TPI.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	TPI is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	CUI Global enjoys a close association with this affiliate through common Board of Director membership and participation, that allows for a significant amount of influence over affiliate business decisions.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, the Company accounts for its investment in this affiliated entity under the equity method.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	A summary of the unaudited financial statements of the affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P63_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company estimates the patents it has filed have a future beneficial value; therefore it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	At the time the patent is approved, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	If the patent is not approved, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P64_S3	A change in the estimate of the patent having a future beneficial value will impact the other assets and expense accounts.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P64_S4	During the years ended 2010, the Company recorded impairment charges of $418,185 related to capitalized patents.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	No. 815 ( FASB ASC 815 ), Derivatives and Hedging , which requires a periodic valuation of the fair value of derivative instruments and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of shares of common stock is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as other expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as other expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1108967_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	The following table summarizes the potential common stock shares at December 31, 2011 and 2010, which may dilute future earnings per share.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P217_S0	The following table sets for the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P218_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company recognized losses for both financial and tax reporting purposes during each of the periods in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P219_S1	Accordingly, no provision for income taxes and/or deferred income taxes payable has been provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P220_S0	An income tax benefit has not been recognized for operating losses generated in prior periods based on uncertainties concerning the ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P220_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company had available net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $40,102,000 .
1108967_12_ITEM15_P220_S2	These operating loss carry-forwards expire in various years through the year ending December 31, 2031; however, because the Company has incurred significant operating losses, utilization of the tax loss carry-forwards are not assured.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P220_S3	The decrease in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $502,000 .
1108967_12_ITEM15_P220_S4	As a result, the non-current deferred income tax asset arising from these net operating loss carry-forwards and from other temporary differences are not recorded in the accompanying balance sheets because a valuation allowance was established to fully reserve such assets due to the uncertainty of the Company s realization of this benefit.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P221_S0	After consideration of all the evidence management has determined that a full valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P222_S0	In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not.
1108967_12_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Company s tax expense differs from the expected tax expense for the periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, computed by applying the Federal Corporate tax rate of 34% to loss before taxes, as follows:
1108967_12_ITEM15_P224_S0	For the periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

1108967_13_ITEM1_P10_S6	Solus enhances that capability by providing a more efficient power supply source, currently in the form of a brick, but scalable to serve numerous customer needs; (2) Test and Measurement , which is the oldest part of our business and, along with providing probes and other test devices, incorporates our unique Vergence Inferential Gas Metering Technology and the GasPT2 device, which we have branded under the name Vergence; and, (3) Electronic Components , which includes our more than 20,000 SKU s and our proprietary motion control devices.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P10_S7	From what we consider to be the world's smallest optical shaft encoder, to our innovative proprietary technology utilized in the AMT modular encoder, we are positioning ourselves to be a preeminent source for motion control products.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P10_S8	In sum, we have built and continue to build a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	We focus our market knowledge, industry network and reputation within the electronics industry into locating, identifying and acquiring market-ready electronic technologies.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Once identified, we put considerable effort into our due diligence process.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	That process is designed to ensure that we acquire only market-ready technologies which are synergistic to our diversified electronics portfolio.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	Once acquired, we assign a team of engineers, market specialists and sales executives to implement our commercialization strategy.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	That end-to-end strategy incorporates everything from branding, to market/product surveys, to identification of appropriate market partners and more.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our current power line, V-Infinity, consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue and recent revenue growth.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc .
1108967_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The company entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One s Digital Power Technology patents.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	The license provides access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into the company s new line of digital point of load power modules.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The company, through its power division, also manufactures a wide range of embedded and external power electronics devices for OEM manufacturers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have developed the first fully featured digital point of load dc-dc converter in the power market under our Novum Advanced Power line of products.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	This product is a next generation product targeted at the intermediate bus power architecture that is prolifically used in the telecom and networking communications market.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In September of 2010 we released full production versions of two point of load modules.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We were finalists for the prestigious Golden Mousetrap Award and EDN Innovation Award for these parts in 2010.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	With the shift towards smarter, smaller, and more energy efficient power requirements, our engineers are seeking innovative solutions that allow them to keep pace with lower core voltages, faster transient response needs and increasing thermal issues that they face in their designs.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our recently introduced Novum NDM2 modules, with a full suite of digital features, specifically address these growing system complexities through intelligent power management.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The NDM2 series is the first to be designed by the company as part of the Ericsson cooperation announced in July 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	The agreement formalizes a plan between the two companies to offer a multi-source digital POL platform based on the Ericsson BMR46X series, with future plans to co-develop modules outside the existing range of 10~50A. We have also developed a middle ground product to ease the customer base into the benefits of digital in power.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	We developed a smart module that allows for the benefits of digital in the design cycle but when installed functions like a highly optimized analog unit.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The company entered into an exclusive Field of Use Agreement with California Power Research to license their BPS-5 topology, now marketed as the Solus Topology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	This topology provides industry leading efficiencies and densities in power design.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	The topology is broadly applicable to both DC-DC and AC-DC products.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	This will allow for the company to have a long roadmap of industry leading products to service its broad customer base.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P19_S4	In addition, its first target is the Intermediate Bus Architecture (IBA) where the Digital POL modules are used.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Through the Solus Topology, we have a proprietary patented power topology for designing unique power circuits.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	This topology allows for higher efficiencies, densities, response time, and price competitiveness that is otherwise unavailable.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our initial product designed using this topology is in the quarter brick dc-dc converter market.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Solus is an entirely new topology, rich in features that accelerate the performance trend trajectories for the big-four power conversion needs in the telecom and server markets: greater efficiency; higher power density; reduced EMI (electro-magnetic interference); and faster transient response four times as fast.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	We have introduced the NQB2060 Novum one quarter brick bus converter as a prime example of the benchmark 720 watts output power performance using the Solus Topology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Since the Solus Topology maintains its effectiveness independent of the control method used, it can operate with analog voltage mode control, analog current mode control, and various digital control profiles.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe that unique feature opens the door for the company to implement this topology in a wide variety of power supply product platforms.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	We also believe that this topology will allow for at least a decade of new product designs and introductions.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, our unique Solus Topology, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT2) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the Vergence GasPT2.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Vergence natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT2, is a low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z).
1108967_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada, and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs ( GC ), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the price of the GasPT2.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Those injection points will continue to use GC s for monitoring.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	On the other hand, there are 1,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the Vergence Technology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P29_S5	In the case of ENAGAS in Spain that ratio is 6 injection points and over 300 access points.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	In addition, there are currently 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Depending on the quality of the gas, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with much cleaner emissions.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S4	Operators attempt to deal with the delay by placing the monitoring station miles away from the turbine or creating large holding tanks to maintain the gas until an analysis can be completed.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P30_S5	The use of the Vergence Technology, will enable those operators to place the GasPT2 units right next to the turbines and by interfacing them with the machine s process control software, the tuning can be accomplished on almost a real-time basis; thus, allowing the turbines to run longer, more efficiently and cleaner.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	In October/November 2012, the GasPT2 device successfully passed first-phase testing by GE-ENERGY at its Turbine Test Facility in Houston, Texas.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	In 2011, the Company reached agreements with several European and United States companies to place beta test units for both laboratory and infield testing.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	These companies included SNAM RETE in Italy; National Grid in the United Kingdom; and GASUNIE in The Netherlands, among others.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	In early 2012, the company began the delivery of beta units to North American companies for their own beta test programs.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition, we signed an exclusive 5-year distribution agreement for the United Kingdom with Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., the largest specialty gas engineering company in England.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	In conjunction with Orbital, we have introduced the combined Vergence GasPT2 unit and Vergence V-Probe to National Grid the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	In January 2012 we entered into a second five (5) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our Vergence technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our Vergence GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	The agreement calls for sales of as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units and is valued from $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 over the five-year term.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	We have entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements with two North American companies, Energy Measurement Consulting (EMC) and MGlobal.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	For its part, in December 2012, EMC issued a purchase order for the scheduled delivery of 150 units in FY 2013.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company has also reached an agreement with BWG/Blue Flame, a company based in Dubai for exclusive representation in the Middle East, including the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and more.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	BWG/Blue Flame are also in negotiations with several large Middle Eastern organizations to place the device in the Gulf Region; along with representatives from Thailand, Romania, Turkey, and India for placement of the device.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The company has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as opposed to optical or magnetic encoding.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	This unique device allows breakthroughs in selectable resolution, shaft-adaptation and convenient mounting solutions to bring ease of installation, reduction in SKU s and economies of scale in purchasing.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The AMT amounts to almost 2000 different encoders in one package.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	The company is selling and distributing the AMT through various customers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	Moreover, the product is being marketed by multiple DC motor manufacturers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	The AMT has been awarded several design wins from Motion Control OEM s producing a wide range of products from cash machines to robotics.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	CUI, Inc. is certified to the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems standards and guidelines.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	CUI is registered as conforming to the requirements of standard: ISO 9001:2008.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Quality Management System is applicable to Design, Development and Distribution of electromechanical components for OEM manufacturing.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	ISO 9001 is accepted worldwide as the inclusive international standard that defines quality.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	The certification of compliance with ISO 9001:2008 recognizes that our policies, practices and procedures ensure consistent quality in the design services, technology and products we provide our customers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	We hope to grow our electromechanical product line through a planned strategy to increase our name recognition as a technology company.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our plan, already in effect, includes:
1108967_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	increasing our customer base by redirecting our customers into the proper channel.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Initially changing our minimum order level from $2,500 up to $5,000.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	The minimum order level may be increased again in future periods.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	It is our intention that interacting with higher level customers and our extra effort to generate their confidence will generate an increased customer base.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	developing collaborative relationships with our customers by seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	developing new technologies and expanded manufacturing capabilities as needed.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	growing our global sales and distribution through our primary international distribution channel, a prominent international sales and distribution strategic partner that ships product to more than 170 countries worldwide from a single location in the United States.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributor with partnership marketing.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	The expansion means more manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	We intend to eventually have field application engineers in the strategic areas driving designs at the customers facility.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our specific product offering ranges from audio jacks to industrial power supplies.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	While the bulk of our business is in power (ac-dc and dc-dc) products, we have a broad line of electromechanical components for the OEM manufacturer.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Because the electromechanical technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, we thrive on being flexible within the industry through our product offering and in how we conduct business.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	The primary focus areas for growth, however, are in engineering and in sales.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	Our products are supported on our website and the products with the highest amount of turnover are stocked and marketed in distribution centers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S5	We strive to create collaborative relationships with our customers, seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P52_S6	We invest in our future and the future of our customers through new technologies, talented employees, expanded manufacturing capabilities and a growing global reach.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our Vergence GasPT2 Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device, the GasPT2.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our strategy for GasPT2 has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our sale or return sales approach has been accepted very positively in Europe and the United States.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our approach focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States in 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	For 2012, the Company will continue its efforts in those areas and also begin the process of taking GasPT2 to the Asian markets, with India identified as the test market.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P53_S5	Beyond this we have a strategy which is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	In addition, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement for the UK with Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., the largest specialty gas engineering company in England.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	In conjunction with Orbital, we have introduced the combined Vergence GasPT2 unit and Vergence V-Probe to National Grid the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	We recently entered into a second five (5) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our Vergence technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our Vergence GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P54_S4	The agreement calls for sales of as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units and is valued from $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 over the three-year term.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	We plan to replicate this type of agreement with other large, regional gas engineering companies in Europe and North America and we are negotiating with several large Middle Eastern groups to place the device in the Gulf Region.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. (GIA), the global GC market will reach more than $1.5 billion by 2015.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Admittedly, that market is mature and, according to GIA, is dominated by aftermarket and accessories sales.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	In contrast, the Vergence Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	It provides almost real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	Taking all of those factors into account, it is likely that the Vergence Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $1.5 billion market.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in the form of technology and potential strategic partners.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, most especially in the power industry, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including Vergence, Novum and Solus.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	Moreover, much like when we acquired CUI, Inc., there are many small, well-run electronics companies that become available for multiple reasons.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies between any potential acquisition and our current business, along with the potential for increased revenue and/or market share.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Research and development costs for CUI Global were $791,332 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $716,321 for the same period during 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs and the Solus Topology, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the Vergence GasPT2.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	The Company expects that research and development expenses will increase during 2013 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company, together with its consolidating subsidiaries, had sixty-two full-time and seven part-time employees.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	None of its employees is represented by a labor union.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Company plans to add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained the relationship with the holder of the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Through an exclusive licensing contract with AnderMotion Technologies, LLC, signed on or about April 20, 2009, CUI acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute motion control devices utilizing the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Through a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Power-One, Inc., signed on or about September 18, 2009, CUI has access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into CUI s new line of digital point of load (POL) power modules.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with California Power Research, Inc., signed on or about March 4, 2010, CUI acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture, market, sell, lease, maintain, give over and dispose of licensed product using the BPS-5 advanced power topology technology.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., signed on or about January 4, 2010, CUI Global acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT2) designed by GL on a worldwide basis.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products and services.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Company retained Hartman and Hartman, P. C., Banner Witcoff, Ltd. and Law Offices of William W. Haefliger to manage its current interests relative to the prosecution of the national and international patents.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company intends to pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally.

1108967_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	The industries in which the company competes are very broad.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	We operate a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitiveness of pricing to differentiate our products from competitors.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of large global firms.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	We feel that our electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	We have a very strong retail distribution partner that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors.

1108967_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	Our Vergence GasPT2 is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.

1108967_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets related to those assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	There were $278,428 and $0 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2012 and 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation .
1108967_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Employee stock compensation is recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes Pricing Model.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The underlying assumptions used in the Black Scholes Pricing Model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including, volatility is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance, the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted, appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website and other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	See Note 13 STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION for additional disclosure and discussion of the employee stock plan and activity.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Common stock, stock options and common stock warrants issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value, as required by FASB ASC 505, which is measured as of the date required by FASB ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees .
1108967_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 505, the stock options or common stock warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the valuation date, which for options and warrants related to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non-performance is the date of the contract, and for all other contracts is the vesting date.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	Expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	Where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date, the expense is computed under the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the end of the period, and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The recognition of the Company s revenues requires judgment, including whether a sale includes multiple elements and, if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	These elements could include licensing rights to manufacture and sell our proprietary patent protected products.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	The ability to identify VSOE for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company does not have any history as to the costs expected to be incurred in granting licensing rights relating to its products.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Therefore, revenues may be recorded that are not in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2012 are $3,039,840.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, operations and investment activities have been funded through cash from operations, proceeds from sales of equity and warrant exercises, and borrowings from financial institutions.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Operating activities generated negative cash flow of $1,803,659 during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared with positive cash flow of $860,705 during the prior year ended.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	This decrease is primarily the result of a larger net loss attributable to CUI Global, Inc. in 2012 of $2,526,321 which included increased sales related travel for CUI, Inc. to manage third party sales representatives, reach new customers, maintain existing customers, and promote new product lines including Novum and Solus, professional fees expenses related to engineering support, testing fees and travel expenses related to the Vergence GasPT2 product as the Company increased the Vergence GasPT2 exposure to customers in North America, parts of Europe and elsewhere, increased expenses associated with being a public company such as filing services and fees, professional fees, and listing fees among others, increased advertising costs for company products, increased commissions to third party sales representatives related to the increase in sales, increased expenses associated with the growth in operations at CUI Japan, operating costs associated with the newer technologies Novum and Solus and the overall growth of the business in relation to revenues.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Additional factors that impacted the cash from operations include increases in trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and unearned revenue of $1,337,048, $1,290,794, $382,852, and $300,786, respectively, and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $280,917.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	The increase in trade accounts receivable is largely attributed to the increased revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012, $11,890,762, as compared to $9,744,499 during the same period in 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	The increase in inventory is primarily related to the inventory on hand associated with the increased back log of customer orders at December 31, 2012 of $14,149,352 as compared with $9,244,748 at December 31, 2011 and increased inventory of GasPT2 units on hand at year end to prevent potential shortages in 2013 associated with manufacturing and calibration lead times.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	The increase in accounts payable is associated with the increase in inventory levels and fourth quarter activity during 2012 as well as timing in relation to payment terms with vendors.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S6	The increase in unearned revenue is related to an increase in the accrual for potential returns from customers and deposits received from customers for orders that have not been fulfilled as of December 31, 2012.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P19_S7	The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily related to decreases in prepayments for inventory purchases as compared to the prior year, which will vary based on the products purchased and the vendors utilized.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	During 2012 and 2011, the Company used stock and warrants as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants and employees.

1108967_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	The large increase in 2012 is attributable to increased stock compensation issued for stock issued to consultants for strategic investor marketing services, employee stock compensation and options expenses.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	During 2012, CUI Global recorded two significant non-cash entries - $73,333 of non-cash interest expense, including amortization of debt offering costs and $278,428 for the impairment of intangible, trademark and trade name V-Infinity.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The intangible, trademark and trade name V-Infinity was determined to have a finite life and an impaired value during 2012.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	As a result of this evaluation and the impairment, management determined the trademark and trade name V-Infinity no longer has an indefinite life, and will instead be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of 5 years.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	During 2011, the Company recorded one significant non-cash entry - $334,747 of non-cash interest expense, including amortization of debt offering costs.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	The decrease in the non-cash interest expense, including amortization of debt offering costs is the result of the completion in mid year 2011 of the amortization of the beneficial interest associated with debts from the CUI, Inc. acquisition offset by an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Wells Fargo debts.
1108967_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	During 2012 the Company had no cash flows from discontinued operating activities where as in 2011, the Company had positive cash flow from discontinued operations of $22,141.

1108967_13_ITEM10_P45_S0	We have taken a number of steps to ensure the continued independence of our independent registered public accounting firm.

1108967_13_ITEM10_P53_S1	The Audit Committee has also considered whether the amount and nature of non-audit services provided by Liggett, Vogt Webb, P.A. is compatible with the auditor s independence.
1108967_13_ITEM10_P54_S0	The nominating committee consists of all of the members of the Board of Directors four of whom are independent directors within the meaning of Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
1108967_13_ITEM10_P54_S1	The nominating committee is responsible for the evaluation of nominees for election as director, the nomination of director candidates for election by the shareholders and evaluation of sitting directors.
1108967_13_ITEM10_P54_S2	The Board has developed a formal policy for the identification or evaluation of nominees.
1108967_13_ITEM10_P54_S3	In general, when the Board determines that expansion of the Board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the Board and management, consultation with the candidate's associates and through other means, a candidate's honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.

1108967_13_ITEM10_P55_S1	Candidates recommended by shareholders will be evaluated based on the same criteria described above.
1108967_13_ITEM10_P55_S2	Shareholders desiring to suggest a candidate for consideration should send a letter to the Company's Secretary and include: (a) a statement that the writer is a shareholder (providing evidence if the person's shares are held in street name) and is proposing a candidate for consideration; (b) the name and contact information for the candidate; (c) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (d) information regarding the candidate's qualifications to be director, including but not limited to an evaluation of the factors discussed above which the Board would consider in evaluating a candidate; (e) information regarding any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate; (f) information regarding potential conflicts of interest; and (g) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as director if nominated and elected.

1108967_13_ITEM11_P0_S0	The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is appointed by the Board of Directors to discharge the Board's responsibilities with respect to all forms of compensation of the Company's executive officers, to administer the Company's equity incentive plans and to produce an annual report on executive compensation for use in the Company's Form 10-K.

1108967_13_ITEM11_P12_S0	Our Compensation Committee meets formally an informally as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Compensation Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P13_S1	On an as requested basis, our Compensation Committee receives and reviews materials prepared by management, consultants or committee members, in advance of each meeting.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P13_S2	Depending on the agenda for the particular meeting, these materials may include:
1108967_13_ITEM11_P14_S0	Reports and executive compensation summary worksheets, which sets forth for each executive officer: current total compensation and incentive compensation target percentages, current equity ownership holdings and general partner ownership interest and current and projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from, over a five year period.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P15_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P15_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P15_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P16_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P16_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P17_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P17_S1	Long term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P17_S2	These shares/units generally vest over a two to four year period.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P17_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long term strategic goals.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P18_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P18_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P19_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P20_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P20_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_13_ITEM11_P21_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P22_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P22_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P22_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, for the Board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P22_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the Board of Directors.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P23_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P23_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P23_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at the 50 th percentile of the peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P24_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management at the Company s annual board meeting.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P24_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving same.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P25_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P25_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P25_S2	In 2012, these non financial performance goals and objectives included achieving accurate financial reporting and timely SEC filings; demonstrating full compliance and superior performance in the Company s environmental, health and safety practices; performing appropriate SOX/404 remediation activities and achieving successful testing of and compliance with SOX requirements and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P25_S3	In addition, the executive team was charged with positioning the company for up-listing to a national stock exchange and an equity raise in early 2012.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P25_S4	Said funding to be used to enhance the company s balance sheet; pay down corporate debt; increase the company s ability to rapidly bring its new products to market; and other appropriate matters.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P26_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual company performance relative to the targets as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P26_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally at the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the Board of Directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P26_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P27_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P28_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P29_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P30_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P31_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends there from.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P32_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P32_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P33_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P33_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: 1) the Company s EBIDTA; 2) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and 3) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P34_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P34_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P34_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management's proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P34_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P35_S0	Incentive awards are paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P36_S0	Annual Board of Directors meetings based on actual company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P37_S0	In many instances the award of restricted common stock vests over a four year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P37_S1	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price, of no less than, the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P37_S2	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P38_S0	Our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc., maintains a 401(k) plan.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P39_S0	The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute to the plan after they have completed 3 months of service and are 21 years of age.

1108967_13_ITEM11_P60_S0	The 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (Executive) provides for the issuance of stock options to attract, retain and motivate directors as well as other management personnel.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P61_S0	The Compensation Committee concluded that, after giving consideration to the directors obligation in representation of the shareholders, the high standard of ethics and talent required, increasing workloads, greater exposure, more stringent director independence standards and the SEC's disclosure rules, directors and committee members should be compensated fairly for time and value delivered and the compensation should be sufficient to attract and retain qualified competent individuals to serve on our board.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P62_S0	The Compensation Committee adopted the recommendations of Compensia and approved a director and committee compensation plan.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P63_S0	The Compensation Committee concluded that the appropriate compensation for calendar year 2009 should be in the form of options granted in an amount equal to the 50 th percentile for similar companies, but discounted by a factor of 10% at an option strike price of $7.50 per share.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P63_S1	This price reflected the true value of the directors work, provides adequate incentive to each director and does not unfairly penalize the directors for current market conditions.
1108967_13_ITEM11_P63_S2	Moreover, the $7.50 strike price reflects the price at which much of the underlying funding and CUI transaction was originally priced.

1108967_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of:
1108967_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive income and loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of CUI Global, Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	CUI Global Inc. ("the Company") is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	CUI defines its products into three categories: electronic components including connectors, speakers, buzzers and control solutions including encoders and sensors; power solutions and test and measurement including the Vergence GasPT2 .
1108967_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories as well as test and measurement capabilities to industries ranging from consumer electronics to defense and alternative energy.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	In July 2009 CUI Global acquired, as a wholly owned subsidiary, Comex Instruments, Ltd., now known as CUI Japan and 49% of Comex Electronics, Ltd.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	Both companies are Japanese based providers of electronic components.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	Effective July 1, 2011, CUI Global entered into an agreement to convey its 49% ownership interest in Comex Electronics to the owners of the remaining 51% who are the original founders and were the original owners of Comex Instruments, for $617,975 in the form of a five year note receivable bearing interest at 4% per annum.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	The operations of CUI Japan are not affected by this divestment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P70_S2	Significant estimates in 2012 and 2011 include estimates used to review the Company s long-lived assets for impairment, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2012 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	The consolidated financial statements for 2011 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan and the discontinued operations of Comex Electronics through June 30, 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	No. 825 ( FASB ASC 825 ), Financial Instruments , requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, deferred compensation and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company does not have financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $2,724,922 and $0 balances at financial institutions which were in excess of the FDIC insured limits.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	However, at December 31, 2012 the Company held $64,497 in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $421 in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P75_S4	At December 31, 2011 the Company held $71,995 in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $62,664 in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with the revenue derived from product sales.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $130,000 and $125,000 was recorded at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P76_S3	The reserve in both periods takes into account aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P76_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of its receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	Inventories consist of finished and un-finished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market; using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 inventory is valued, net of allowances, at $4,843,905 and $3,563,111, respectively.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The allowances for inventory were $250,000 and $240,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	At December 31, 2012, CUI had finished goods of $4,675,032, raw materials of $365,242, and work in process of $53,631.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	Furniture, equipment and software are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	When furniture and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	The cost of furniture, equipment and software is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	The estimated useful lives and accumulated depreciation for furniture, equipment and software are as follows:
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	Long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets related to those assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P84_S6	There were $278,428 and $0 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2012 and 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third party experts.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Intangible assets with a determinable finite life, other than goodwill, including technology rights and patents are amortized over an estimated useful life of 15 years or their estimated useful life if less than 15 years.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	Technology rights are amortized over a twenty year life and are reviewed for impairment annually.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Patent costs are amortized over the life of the patent.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	Any patents not approved will be expensed at that time.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually during the second quarter and whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	Through this review of all known events and circumstances, management concluded that an impairment charge of $278,428 was necessary regarding the Intangible, trademark and trade name V-Infinity during 2012.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	The analysis completed in 2012 determined that there was no other impairment necessary during 2012 to other intangible assets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	As detailed in ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other subsection 20, the Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	The analysis completed in both 2012 and 2011, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill assets.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	Through the reviews completed in 2012 and 2011, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P95_S2	Under this ASU, CUI is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing a 11.54% interest at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively) in Test Products International, Inc., hereafter referred to as TPI.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	TPI is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	CUI Global enjoys a close association with this affiliate through common Board of Director membership and participation, that allows for a significant amount of influence over affiliate business decisions.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, the Company accounts for its investment in this affiliated entity under the equity method.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	A summary of the unaudited financial statements of the affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1108967_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation .
1108967_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P102_S2	The statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Employee stock compensation is recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes Pricing Model.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	The underlying assumptions used in the Black Scholes Pricing Model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including, volatility is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance, the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted, appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website and other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	See Note 13 STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION for additional disclosure and discussion of the employee stock plan and activity.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Common stock, stock options and common stock warrants issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value, as required by FASB ASC 505, which is measured as of the date required by FASB ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees .
1108967_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 505, the stock options or common stock warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the valuation date, which for options and warrants related to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non-performance is the date of the contract, and for all other contracts is the vesting date.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	Expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P105_S3	Where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date, the expense is computed under the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the end of the period, and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	The recognition of revenues requires judgment, including whether a sale includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	Customers receive certain elements of CUI Global products over a period of time.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	These elements include licensing rights to manufacture and sell our proprietary patent protected products.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P107_S2	The ability to identify VSOE for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	CUI Global does not have any history as to the costs expected to be incurred in granting licensing rights relating to its products.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	Therefore, revenues may be recorded that are not in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Revenues in connection with electronic devices, component, and test and measurement equipment are recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer, collectability is reasonably assumed, the price is fixed and determinable and persuasive evidence of arrangement exists.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	Amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are included in sales, and were $53,539 and $60,628 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	The Company expenses inbound shipping and handling costs as cost of revenues.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	A warranty reserve liability is recorded based on estimates of future costs on sales recognized.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	There was no warranty reserve recorded at December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	The costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are charged to operations as incurred.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $872,250 and $837,584, respectively.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	No. 740 ( FASB ASC 740 ), Income Taxes .
1108967_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	Under FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P114_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P114_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	Valuation allowances have been established against deferred tax assets due to uncertainties in the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to make realization of such assets more likely than not.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	An income tax benefit has not been recognized for its operating losses generated during 2012 and 2011 based on uncertainties concerning the ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
1108967_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	There was no income tax receivable at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

1108967_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues depend on key customers .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company s major product lines in 2013 were power and electro-mechanical products and natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During 2012 and 2011, the company s major product lines were power and electro-mechanical products.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	During 2013, 50% of revenues were derived from two customers at 33% and 17%.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	During 2012, 51% of revenues were derived from two customers at 47% and 4%.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	During 2011, 45% of revenues were derived from two customers at 41% and 4%.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	At December 31, 2013, of the gross trade accounts receivable from continuing operations totaling $9,340,909, 25% was due from one customer.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	At December 31, 2012, 45% of the gross trade accounts receivable from continuing operations totaling $5,095,926, 57% was due from two customers: 37% and 8%.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	At December 31, 2011, 46% of the gross trade accounts receivable from continuing operations totaling $3,819,641, 53% was due from five customers: 21%, 9%, 7%, 5% and 4%.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue to maintain all of our existing key customers in the future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Should we, for any reason, discontinue our business relationship with any one of these key customers, the impact to our revenue stream would be substantial.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on third party distributors to generate a substantial part of our revenue and, if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our electronic component products through distributors and we expect that sales through these distributors will represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our ability to expand our distribution channels depends in part on our ability to educate our distributors about our products, which are complex.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Many of our distributors have established relationships with our competitors.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If our distributors choose to place greater emphasis on products and services of their own or those offered by our competitors, our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If our distributors do not effectively market and sell our products, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The loss of one or more of our larger distributors, who may cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our failure to recruit additional distributors or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products or conflicts between distributor sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are a relatively small specialty component and solutions business and face formidable competition .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We define our specialty solutions business into two categories: PSU (power supply units) that includes our Novum digital power and Solus advanced power and Components including our AMT modular encoder and our GasPT2.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our international competitors.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the specialty electronic component and solutions business that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We face formidable competition in every aspect of our specialty component and solutions business from other companies many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader product offerings than ours.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We also expect competition to intensify in the future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, the market for our electronic components and our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT2, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive environments.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We continue our process of integrating recent acquisitions into our own business model and we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The areas where we face risks include:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	other as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, a majority of Orbital Gas Systems Limited s revenues for each of its last two fiscal years has come from one customer.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we fail to continue to do business with Orbital s primary customer at substantially similar or greater levels than recent historical levels, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be significantly harmed.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We will need to grow our organization and we may encounter diff culties in managing this growth .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had one hundred seventy full-time employees .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products including the GasPT2, Novum digital power and Solus advanced power and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operating results will vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	the impact of write downs of excess and obsolete inventory.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operating expenses will increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Historically, we limited our investment in operations, but in the future we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase substantially to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our recent listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are making significant investments in using more professional services and expanding our operations outside the United States.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We intend to make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may determine the need in the future to build a direct sales force to market and sell our products or provide additional resources or cooperative funds to our distributors.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We expect our increased investments to adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long term benefit.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of distributors, customers and end-users .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the electronic component market.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We expect the brand identity that we have developed through CUI, GasPT2, Novum, AMT, Solus, and CUI Japan to significantly contribute to the success of our business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Maintaining and enhancing these brands and any brands we might acquire, such as Orbital Gas Systems, is critical to expanding our base of distributors, customers and end-users.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, which we may not do successfully.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The markets for development, distribution and sale of our products are rapidly evolving.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which, in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S7	It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	One of our subsidiaries and certain suppliers are in Japan and located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have research, development and manufacturing resources in Japan.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The risk of earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, over which we have no control, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our location in Japan or a third-party provider could cause interruptions in the products that we provide.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Earthquakes, fire, flooding or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our development, manufacturing, assembly, testing or shipping capacity.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in product development or shipments of our products until we are able to shift our development, manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor or our research and development activities to another location.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Defects in our products could harm our reputation and business .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our electronic products are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any defects or errors in our electronic products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	harm to our results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of electronic components or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	As a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of CUI Global and our subsidiary companies, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan (formerly Comex Instruments, Ltd.), as well as the development of our technologies, our business culture and our strategic direction.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Competition for personnel with these skills is intense.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We believe our future success will depend in part on the following:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We license a significant amount of our underlying intellectual property from third parties, i. e., AMT Encoder Technology, Novum Digital Point of Load Technology, Solus Advanced Power Topology Technology, GasPT2 Technology and VE-Technology.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P64_S6	Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S4	In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	These claims, whether or not successful, could:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	require us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Even if we have not infringed any third parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If our contract manufacturers do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Because most of our contract manufacturers operate outside the United States, where prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft is more difficult than in the United States, certain of our contract manufacturers, their affiliates, their other customers or their suppliers may attempt to use our intellectual property and trade secrets to manufacture our products for themselves or others without our knowledge.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Although we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The market price for the Company s common stock is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control, which means our market price could be depressed and could impair our ability to raise capital:
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Additionally, because our stock is thinly trading, there is a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock s true value.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Potential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by our existing line of credit, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol CUI .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our shares of common stock are thinly traded.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Although we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, including large blocks of preferred stock as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred shareholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Preferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it diff cult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The Company is a Colorado corporation.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	As permitted by Colorado law, the Company s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against a director.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our charter documents and outstanding note to IED, Inc. may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	do not provide for cumulative voting rights.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our operating subsidiary, CUI, Inc. issued a note to IED, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The note provides that, for so long as any obligations are outstanding under the note, IED will have a right to match any bona fide offer from a third party to acquire CUI, Inc. by any means.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	This matching right could discourage third parties from making an offer to acquire us, which would involve indirectly acquiring CUI, Inc., or from acquiring CUI, Inc. directly, in a transaction our shareholders might find advantageous because any such offer could be matched by IED and result in the third party utilizing time and resources to formulate an offer without being able to complete a transaction.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As a private company, Orbital Gas Systems may not have in place a system of internal control over financial reporting that is adequate to manage that business effectively as part of a public company .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Through our Orbital Gas Systems acquisition, we acquired shares of a private company that were not previously subject to financial reporting on the basis of U.S. GAAP, and have not been subject to periodic reporting as a public company.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	There can be no assurance that Orbital Gas Systems has in place a system of internal control over financial reporting that is required for public companies.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance and accounting staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments, and would increase our costs of doing business.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Moreover, if we discover aspects of the Orbital Gas Systems internal controls that need improvement, we cannot be certain that our remedial measures will be effective.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or increase our risk of material weakness in internal controls.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	A significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill, which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We have goodwill totaling approximately $18.5 million following the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We will be required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates, at least once a year.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	A portion of our revenue arises from our international operations and we anticipate that, as we grow, our revenues from international operations will increase.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in local currencies.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P100_S3	In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P100_S4	The Company does not undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT2, has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	There is no assurance our acquisition of Orbital will accelerate sales of the GasPT2 device .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT2 device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT2 device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT2 device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Several factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT2 device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT2 device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT2 device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Also, while our management is optimistic that the acquisition of Orbital will stimulate and accelerate sales of the GasPT2 device, there is no assurance that GasPT2 device sales will actually increase in the near future due to the Orbital acquisition.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The loss of any of Orbital s key management or employees could harm Orbital s future business prospects .
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We will be dependent upon the existing management team and key employees of Orbital for the foreseeable future.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Orbital currently has approximately 105 employees, who are primarily focused on engineering, sales and manufacturing.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Andrew Ridge continues to be primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations of Orbital since 2010 as Managing Director of Orbital.
1108967_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	The company has identified and is currently training two middle-managers to take over day-to-day operation of Orbital in order to provide: (1) an organized succession plan; and (2) the ability to allow Mr. Ridge to direct more of his attention to sales, marketing and technical issues.
1108967_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	On September 27, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Properties, LLC, signed closing documents on the purchase of our Tualatin, Oregon corporate office real estate located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue in the Tualatin Franklin Business Park.
1108967_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The purchase price for this acquisition was $5,050,000 and was partially funded by a promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $3,693,750 plus interest at the rate of 2.0% above LIBOR, payable over ten years.
1108967_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Additionally, subsequent to the acquisition of CUI Japan the Company has subleased space in Tokyo, Japan from Comex Electronics.
1108967_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	As an integrated part of the Orbital Gas Systems Limited acquisition, CUI Global, Inc. acquired the land and buildings owned by Orbital.
1108967_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	In addition to the land and buildings owned by Orbital, the Orbital leases facilities for office and manufacturing space requirements.
1108967_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are not a party in any legal proceedings.
1108967_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	No director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any class of voting securities of the Company or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate of the Company or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

1108967_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	The reverse split ratio was set at one for thirty (1:30) that became effective February 17, 2012.
1108967_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	The reverse split was an element necessary for up-listing the common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market that became effective February 17, 2012 under the trading symbol CUI .
1108967_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The reverse split did not affect any stockholder s proportionate equity interest in the Company or the rights, preferences, privileges or priorities of any stockholder, other than an adjustment due to fractional shares.
1108967_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	The reverse split did not cause a significant change in the number of beneficial owners of our common stock.
1108967_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	Likewise, the reverse split did not affect the total stockholders equity in the Company or any components of stockholders equity as reflected on the financial statements of the Company except to change the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock.
1108967_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The company filed a Form S-1 registration statement to register 2,222,222 shares of $0.001 par value common stock that became effective February 14, 2012.
1108967_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	These shares of registered stock were sold to or through Merriman Capital, Inc. as our underwriter for ten million dollars ($10,000,000).

1108967_14_ITEM6_P6_S5	As such, the operations of Comex Electronics are reported in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	The Company neither holds nor issues financial in struments for trading purposes.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following sections provide quantitative information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the U.S. dollar , the British pound sterling and the Japanese yen.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., U.K. and Japanese operations, respectively .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency , the U.S. dollar , for consolidation purposes .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012:
1108967_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	1 On April 18, 2013, we closed on our share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited which was effective April 1, 2013.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company believes, that d uring fiscal ended December 31, 2013 , the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia , provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our Investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compiles a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are diversified and maintained with several financial institutions .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits .
1108967_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company has trade receivable and revenues concentrations with large customers.
1108967_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Additionally, the Company has a large concentration of trade receivables and revenues in the United Kingdom.

1108967_14_ITEM9_P0_S0	The Company has had no disagreements with Liggett, Vogt Webb, P.A. as the Company s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to (i) our CFO having Super User rights within the Company s accounting software, (ii) failures in applying revenue recognition policies in accordance with U.S. GAAP , and (iii) segregation of duties and management oversight related to cash account access rights and authorities.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of CUI Global, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992).
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 was ineffective as a result of the material weaknesses described below.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The Chief Financial Officer maintains Super User rights in the Company s general ledger software.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	This access prevents proper segregation of duties and increases opportunities for management s override of internal controls.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company identified a failure in segregation of duties and management oversight related to the access rights and authorization related to cash accounts at Orbital Gas Systems Limited.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Orbital Gas Systems Limited, which we acquired effective April 1, 2013, which entity is included in our December 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements and constitutes 40.1% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2013 and 28.8% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Liggett, Vogt Webb, P.A., our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P12_S0	There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Management has identified additional steps necessary to address the material weaknesses described above.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P13_S1	These measures include the implementation of the overall internal control over financial reporting procedures at Orbital Gas Systems Limited.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P13_S2	Specific to these material weaknesses, management has implemented appropriate controls and procedures around percentage of completion revenue recognition , recognition of revenue under distribution agreements, removal of Super User accounting system access rights by CFO, as well as segregation of authorities over cash account access and rights therein.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P13_S3	Management has implemented these additional procedures and expects these material weaknesses to be resolved fully in 2014.

1108967_14_ITEM9A_P16_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P16_S2	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1108967_14_ITEM9A_P16_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P17_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P17_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P18_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P18_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P19_S0	As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Orbital Gas Systems Limited from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, because it was acquired by the Company during 2013.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P19_S1	We have also excluded Orbital Gas Systems Limited from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P20_S0	Orbital Gas Systems Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 40.1% and 28.8%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1108967_14_ITEM9A_P21_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P22_S0	The Company was improperly recognizing revenue related to contracts by applying a Non-U.S. GAAP methodology under percentage of completion accounting as well as improperly recognizing revenue related to distribution agreements, which resulted in material year end audit adjustments to correct the errors.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P23_S0	The Chief Financial Officer maintains Super User rights in the Company s general ledger software.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P23_S1	This access prevents proper segregation of duties and increases opportunities for management s override of internal controls.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P24_S0	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2013 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 31, 2014, on those financial statements.
1108967_14_ITEM9A_P25_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-1992).

1108967_14_ITEM10_P23_S0	We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and corporate governance, which we believe are essential to running our business efficiently, serving our stockholders well and maintaining our integrity in the marketplace.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P23_S1	We have adopted a Corporate Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, a code of business conduct and ethics for employees, directors and officers (including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer).
1108967_14_ITEM10_P23_S2	We have also adopted the following governance guides:
1108967_14_ITEM10_P23_S3	Charter of the Audit Committee, Charter of the Compensation Committee, policy for Director Independence, Nominating Committee guide, Disclosure Controls and Procedures and, most recently adopted, Whistleblower Policy , all of which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, form the framework for our corporate governance.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P23_S4	These corporate governance documents are available on the internet and our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P24_S0	We have always believed in strong and effective corporate governance procedures and practices.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P24_S1	In that spirit, we have summarized several of our corporate governance practices below.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P25_S0	The Board of Directors and its committees have an important role in the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment process.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P25_S1	The board regularly reviews with management the Company s financial and business strategies which include a discussion of relevant material risks as appropriate.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P25_S2	The board discusses with the Company s outside general counsel, as appropriate, its risk oversight and assessment as well as any material risks to the Company.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P25_S3	In addition, the board delegates risk management responsibilities to the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, which committees are each all comprised of independent directors.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P26_S0	The Audit Committee, as part of its charter, oversees the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment of the Company and oversees and assesses the risks associated with the corporate governance and ethics of the Company.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P26_S1	Risk considerations are a material aspect of the Compensation Committee.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P27_S0	The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to executive compensation.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P27_S1	In addition, the Compensation Committee also, as appropriate, assesses the risks relating to the Company s overall compensation programs.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P27_S2	While the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee oversee the management of the risk areas identified above, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P27_S3	This enables the board and its committees to coordinate the risk management, assessment and oversight roles.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P28_S0	Our Board of Directors has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines to establish a framework within which it will conduct its business and to guide management in its running of your Company.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P28_S1	The governance guidelines can be found on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com and are summarized below.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P29_S0	It is important that our Board of Directors and its committees are performing effectively and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P29_S1	The Board of Directors and each committee are responsible for annually assessing their effectiveness in fulfilling their obligations.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P30_S0	On a regular basis, at the conclusion of regularly scheduled board meeting, the independent directors are encouraged to meet privately, without our management or any non-independent directors.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P31_S0	The board and each of its committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our expense, without management's consent.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P32_S0	We expect our directors, executives and employees to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics and honesty.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P32_S1	Our credibility and reputation depend upon the good judgment, ethical standards and personal integrity of each director, executive and employee.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P32_S2	In order to provide assurances to the Company and its stockholders, we have implemented standards of business conduct which provide clear conflict of interest guidelines to its employees and directors, as well as an explanation of reporting and investigatory procedures.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P33_S0	We believe that it is important that stockholders understand our governance practices.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P33_S1	In order to help ensure transparency of our practices, we have posted information regarding our corporate governance procedures on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P34_S0	In furtherance of our governance transparency and ethical standards, we recently adopted a comprehensive Whistleblower Policy that encourages employees to report to proper authorities incorrect financial reporting, unlawful activity, activities that are not in line with CUI Global Code of Business Conduct or activities which otherwise amount to serious improper conduct.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P34_S1	Our Whistleblower Policy is posted on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.

1108967_14_ITEM10_P43_S0	The Audit Committee reviews the financial information that will be provided to the stockholders and others, the systems of internal controls established by management and the board and the independence and performance of the Company s audit process.

1108967_14_ITEM10_P45_S0	Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee has recommended that the audited financial statements are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P45_S1	The Audit Committee has also considered whether the amount and nature of non-audit services provided by Liggett, Vogt Webb, P.A. is compatible with the auditor s independence and determined that it is compatible.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S0	The nominating committee consists of all of the members of the Board of Directors who are "independent directors" within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of The NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S1	The nominating committee is responsible for the evaluation of nominees for election as director, the nomination of director candidates for election by the stockholders and evaluation of sitting directors.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S2	The board has developed a formal policy for the identification and evaluation of nominees, Charter of the Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, which can be reviewed on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S3	In general, when the board determines that expansion of the board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the board and management, consultation with the candidate's associates and through other means, a candidate's honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S4	The committee reviews any special expertise, for example, that qualifies a person as an audit committee financial expert, membership or influence in a particular geographic or business target market, or other relevant business experience.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P46_S5	To date the Company has not paid any fee to any third party to identify or evaluate, or to assist it in identifying or evaluating, potential director candidates.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P47_S0	The nominating committee considers director candidates nominated by stockholders during such times as the Company is actively considering obtaining new directors.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P47_S1	Candidates recommended by stockholders will be evaluated based on the same criteria described above.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P47_S2	Stockholders desiring to suggest a candidate for consideration should send a letter to the Company's secretary and include: (a) a statement that the writer is a shareholder (providing evidence if the person's shares are held in street name) and is proposing a candidate for consideration; (b) the name and contact information for the candidate; (c) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (d) information regarding the candidate's qualifications to be director, including but not limited to an evaluation of the factors discussed above which the board would consider in evaluating a candidate; (e) information regarding any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate; (f) information regarding potential conflicts of interest and (g) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as director if nominated and elected.

1108967_14_ITEM10_P48_S0	We have formed a Disclosure Committee, which has been adopted by our CEO and CFO ( Principal Officers ) and ratified by our Audit Committee.

1108967_14_ITEM10_P73_S0	None of the members of the Company s Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the last completed fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P73_S1	None of the Company s executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on the Company s board of directors or Compensation Committee during the last completed fiscal year.
1108967_14_ITEM10_P74_S0	We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the proxy statement on Schedule 14A for the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P0_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P0_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P0_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P1_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P1_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P2_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P2_S1	Long term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock or stock options.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P2_S2	These awards generally vest over a two to four year period.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P2_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long term strategic goals.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P3_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P3_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P4_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P5_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P5_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_14_ITEM11_P6_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P7_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on Company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, for the board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the Board of Directors.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P8_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P8_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at or near the compensation of peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P8_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at that of peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P9_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management annually to the Board of Directors.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P9_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving the same.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P10_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P10_S2	In 2013, these non-financial performance goals and objectives included the successful equity raise; closing on the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Limited; the addition of a second distribution channel for CUI, Inc. products; continued product development and new product introductions; and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual Company performance relative to the targets set as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally at the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the Board of Directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P11_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P12_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P13_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P14_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P15_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P16_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends therefrom.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P17_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P17_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P18_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P18_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: (i) the Company s EBIDTA; (ii) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and (iii) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P19_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P19_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P19_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management s proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P19_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P20_S0	Incentive awards are paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P20_S1	The incentive award targets for the executives are established at the beginning of the year, generally, as a percentage of their base salary and the actual awards are determined at the following year s annual board of directors meetings based on actual Company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P20_S2	In many instances the award of restricted common stock vests over a four year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P20_S3	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price of no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_14_ITEM11_P20_S4	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.

1108967_14_ITEM13_P4_S3	It was secured by a deed of trust on the purchased property which was executed by CUI Properties, LLC and guaranteed by CUI Global, Inc.
1108967_14_ITEM13_P4_S4	In conjunction with the purchase, the parties to this transaction entered into a Swap Transaction Confirmation agreement effective October 1, 2013 incorporating the terms and definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

1108967_14_ITEM13_P7_S1	Also in August 2010, the Company replaced the $4,000,000 cash loan from Commerce Bank of Oregon with a $4,000,000 term note through the Business Credit division of Wells Fargo Capital Finance, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, with a July 31, 2012 maturity date, paying interest only at an interest rate equal to the daily three month LIBOR plus 4.00% and secured by personal letters of credit from a related party.

1108967_14_ITEM14_P8_S0	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities may be invoked to disclaim liability for damages arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1934 (collectively, the "Acts"), as amended, it is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Acts and are therefore, unenforceable.

1108967_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Effective May 16, 2008, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Waytronx Holdings, Inc., to acquire the assets of CUI, Inc., a Tualatin, Oregon based provider of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	The wholly owned subsidiary was renamed CUI, Inc. following the close of the acquisition.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing an 11.54 % interest at December 31, 2012; and 11.54 % interest thru June 30, 2013 and 8.62 % thereafter) in Test Products International, Inc., a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.

1108967_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P78_S3	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P78_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2013 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, CUI Properties, LLC and Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (included since April 1, 2013), hereafter referred to as the Company .

1108967_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Level 1 Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted for similar assets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	Level 2 includes assets or liabilities valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities; that is, the inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, billings in excess of costs, unearned revenue, and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2013 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S3	Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had $ 2,964,871 and $ 250,000 , respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $ 137,156 and $ 0 , respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC).
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S5	At December 31, 2013 the Company held $ 108,747 in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $ 6,984,417 in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P85_S6	At December 31, 2012 the Company held $ 64,497 in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $ 421 in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company considers all investments with original maturities over 90 days that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date to be short-term investments.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	Both short- and long-term investments primarily include money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes, and commercial paper.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	Preimums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	Under this method, dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	At December 31, 2013, CUI Global had $ 10,868,961 of short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity, which are reported at amortized cost, which approximates market.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	At December 31, 2013, the Company had $ 9,750,000 of investments in certificates of deposit which were covered under FDIC insured limits and covered under $ 500,000 of SIPC insured programs for investments.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with revenue derived from product sales.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P89_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 285,348 and $ 130,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is considered adequate.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P89_S3	The reserve in both periods takes into account aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P89_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P90_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of the CUI, Inc. foreign customer receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	Inventories consist of finished and un-finished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market; using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	At December 31, 2013, and 2012, inventory is valued, net of allowances, at $ 7,027,644 , and $ 4,843,905 , respectively.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	The allowances for inventory were $ 549,981 , and $ 250,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company provides allowances for inventories estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company s estimation process for assessing the net realizable value is based upon its known backlog, projected future demand, historical usage and expected market conditions.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	At December 31, 2013, CUI had finished goods of $ 5,776,916 , raw materials of $ 1,290,851 , and work in process of $ 509,858 .
1108967_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	Land is recorded at cost and includes expenditures made to ready it for use.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	Land is considered to have an infinite useful life.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	Buildings are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Furniture, vehicles, equipment and software are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	When furniture, vehicles and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The cost of furniture, vehicles, equipment and software is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	The estimated useful lives for land, buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment and software are as follows:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	Long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets related to those assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long -lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P103_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P104_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third party experts.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	The following are the estimated useful life for the intangible assets:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	* Technology rights are amortized over a twenty year life or the term of the rights agreement.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	** Patents are amortized over the life of the patent.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	Any patents not approved will be expensed at that time.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life based.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	**** Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and when circumstances suggest.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P115_S2	Under this ASU, CUI is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P119_S2	In 2011, 2012 and 2013, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P119_S3	Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing an 11.54% interest at December 31, 2012; and 11.54% interest thru June 30, 2013 and 8.62% thereafter) in Test Products International, Inc., hereafter referred to as TPI.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	TPI is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Company s proportionate share, based on present ownership interests, of: (a) the investee s profit or loss after the date of acquisition; (b) changes in the Company s equity that have not been recognized in the investee s profit or loss; and (c) certain other adjustments.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	CUI Global enjoys a close association with this affiliate through common Board of Director membership and participation that allows for a significant amount of influence over affiliate business decisions.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, the Company accounts for its investment in this affiliated entity under the equity method.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P123_S2	A summary of the financial statements of the affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company estimates the patents it has filed have a future beneficial value; therefore it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	At the time the patent is approved, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	If the patent is not approved, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company uses various derivative instruments including forward currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage certain exposures.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	These instruments are entered into under the Company s corporate risk management policy to minimize exposure and are not for speculative trading purposes.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P125_S2	The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P125_S3	Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	No. 815 ( FASB ASC 815 ), Derivatives and Hedging , which requires a periodic valuation of the fair value of derivative instruments and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation .
1108967_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P127_S2	Employee stock compensation is recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes Pricing Model.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P127_S3	The underlying assumptions used in the Black Scholes Pricing Model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research; and (4) data website and other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	See Note 12. , for additional disclosure and discussion of the employee stock plan and activity.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	Common stock, stock options and common stock warrants issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value, as required by FASB ASC 505, which is measured as of the date required by FASB ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees .
1108967_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	In accordance with FASB ASC 505, the stock options or common stock warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the valuation date, which for options and warrants related to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non-performance is the date of the contract, and for all other contracts is the performance completion date.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	Expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.
1108967_14_ITEM15_P129_S3	Where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date, the expense is computed based off an estimate of the fair value of the stock award as valued under the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the end of the period, and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs.

Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to the best of my knowledge:
1108967_14_ITEM15_P384_S0	The information contained in the annual report fairly presents, in all materials respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company s principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	CUI, Inc., is based in Tualatin, Oregon and CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Both CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan are providers of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	CUI and CUI Japan define their product offering into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions which includes among other power products, the Novum Digital Power Modules and the Solus Power Topology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our current power line consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue and recent revenue growth.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc .
1108967_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The company entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One s Digital Power Technology patents.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	The license provides access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into the company s new line of digital point of load power modules.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The company, through its power division, also manufactures a wide range of embedded and external power electronics devices for OEM manufacturers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	We have developed the first fully featured digital point of load dc-dc converter in the power market under our Novum Advanced Power line of products.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	This product is a next generation product targeted at the intermediate bus power architecture that is prolifically used in the telecom and networking communications market.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In September of 2010 we released full production versions of two point of load modules.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We were finalists for the prestigious Golden Mousetrap Award and EDN Innovation Award for these parts in 2010.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	With the shift towards smarter, smaller, and more energy efficient power requirements, our engineers are seeking innovative solutions that allow them to keep pace with lower core voltages, faster transient response needs and increasing thermal issues that they face in their designs.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our recently introduced Novum NDM2 modules, with a full suite of digital features, specifically address these growing system complexities through intelligent power management.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The NDM2 series is the first to be designed by the company as part of the Ericsson cooperation announced in July 2011.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	The agreement formalizes a plan between the two companies to offer a multisource digital POL platform based on the Ericsson BMR46X series footprint, as well as plans for the co-development of modules outside the existing range of 10~50A. We have also developed a middle ground product to ease the customer base into the benefits of digital in power.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We developed a smart module that allows for the benefits of digital in the design cycle but when installed functions like a highly optimized analog unit.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2014, CUI, Ericsson Power Modules and Murata announced the formation of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) consortium.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The goal of the AMP alliance is to realize the most technically advanced, end-to-end solutions and provide a complete ecosystem of hardware, software and support.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Beyond purely mechanical specifications, it is the standardization of monitoring, control and communications functions, and the creation of common configuration files for plug-and-play interoperability that will ensure compatibility between each firms products.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	The company entered into an exclusive Field of Use Agreement with California Power Research to license their BPS-5 topology, now marketed as the Solus Topology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	This topology provides industry leading efficiencies and densities in power design.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The topology is broadly applicable to both DC-DC and AC-DC products.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	This will allow for the company to have a long roadmap of industry leading products to service its broad customer base.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	In addition, its first target is the Intermediate Bus Architecture (IBA) where the Digital POL modules are used.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Through the Solus Topology, we have a proprietary patented power topology for designing unique power circuits.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	This topology allows for higher efficiencies, densities, response time, and price competitiveness that is otherwise unavailable.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our initial product designed using this topology is in the quarter brick dc-dc converter market.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	Solus is an entirely new topology, rich in features that accelerate the performance trend trajectories for the big- four power conversion needs in the telecom and server markets: greater efficiency; higher power density; reduced EMI (electro-magnetic interference); and faster transient response four times as fast.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P14_S4	We have introduced the NQB2060 Novum one quarter brick bus converter as a prime example of the benchmark 720 watts output power performance using the Solus Topology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Since the Solus Topology maintains its effectiveness independent of the control method used, it can operate with analog voltage mode control, analog current mode control, and various digital control profiles.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	We believe that unique feature opens the door for the company to implement this topology in a wide variety of power supply product platforms.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	We also believe that this topology will allow for at least a decade of new product designs and introductions.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, our unique Solus Topology, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	The company has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as opposed to optical or magnetic encoding.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	This unique device allows breakthroughs in selectable resolution, shaft-adaptation and convenient mounting solutions to bring ease of installation, reduction in SKU s and economies of scale in purchasing.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The AMT amounts to almost 2000 different encoders in one package.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The company is selling and distributing the AMT through various customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Moreover, the product is being marketed by multiple DC motor manufacturers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The AMT has been awarded several design wins from Motion Control OEM s producing a wide range of products from cash machines to robotics.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	CUI, Inc. is certified to the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems standards and guidelines.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	CUI is registered as conforming to the requirements of standard: ISO 9001:2008, The Quality Management System is applicable to Design, Development and Distribution of electro- mechanical components for OEM manufacturing.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	ISO 9001 is accepted worldwide as the inclusive international standard that defines quality.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The certification of compliance with ISO 9001:2008 recognizes that our policies, practices and procedures ensure consistent quality in the design services, technology and products we provide our customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Effective April 1, 2013, CUI Global closed on a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales ( Orbital ), from Orbital s sole shareholder.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Orbital is the largest natural gas systems integrator in the U.K. Orbital has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 25 years.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition, Orbital is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the U.K. and one of the most respected specialist gas engineering companies in the world.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Orbital has developed its portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	Moreover, its proprietary VE Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT2 Technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT2) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT2.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Company has minimum commitments under this licensing contract.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT2, is a low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z).
1108967_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs ( GC ), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the price of the GasPT2.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Those injection points will continue to use GC s for monitoring.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	On the other hand, there are 2,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT2 Technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	In addition, there are currently 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPTi Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with much cleaner emissions.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	It is this greater efficiency that has lead National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, recently cancelling an order for several GC s and, in October 2013, replacing those GC s with an order for eight (8) GasPTi devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	In conjunction with the Orbital acquisition, we have moved the entire GasPT2 technology portfolio, along with the VE-Probe, into Orbital s product division, Orbital Global Solutions (Orbital-GS).
1108967_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Orbital-GS has successfully introduced the combined GasPT2 unit and VE-Probe to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device has now successfully undergone second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	In January 2012 the company entered into a five (5) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT2 technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	SOCRATE is the vendor-of-choice for SNAM RETE GAS ( SRG ) and was referred to the company by SRG.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	SOCRATE continues to be involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system has concluded 11 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Additionally, Orbital has received fiscal certification from the highly respected European certification company, NMI-Certin.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Following the acquisition of Orbital and the transfer of gas operations to Orbital-GS, the company has entered into a series of thirty-eight (38) Distribution Agreements with internationally recognized entities in the natural gas industry.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	These agreements are designed to supplement and enhance our previously announced and continuing agreements with EMC, MGlobal, BWG/Blue Flame and SOCRATE.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	On July 30, 2013 our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE-Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT2 and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The GasPT2 technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	By combining the GasPT2 technology with the equally unique VE-Probe, which is able to provide a gas sample from a high pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The GasPTi system is able to accurately provide almost real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Moreover, it provides this real-time analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	This VE-Technology acquisition gives us the ability to control and produce the entire Bill of Materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a far larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Additionally, we can now also manufacture, market and sell additional applications for the VE-Technology, including sampling systems separate from the GasPT2 and Thermowells found throughout all pipeline systems.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	We hope to grow our electromechanical product line through a planned strategy to increase our name recognition as a technology company.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our plan, already in effect, includes:
1108967_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Developing collaborative relationships with our customers by seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Developing new technologies and expanded manufacturing capabilities as needed.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Growing our global sales and distribution through our primary international distribution channel, a prominent international sales and distribution strategic partner that ships product to more than 170 countries worldwide from a single location in the United States.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributor with partnership marketing.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	The expansion means more manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P47_S5	We intend to eventually have field application engineers in the strategic areas driving designs at the customers facility.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT2 Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our strategy for GasPT2 has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our sale or return sales approach has been accepted very positively in Europe and the United States.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	For the past three years, this approach focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States and the Company will continue its efforts in those areas as well as begin the process in the Asian markets, with India identified as the test market.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., the largest specialty gas engineering company in England, introduced the combined GasPT2 unit and V-Probe to National Grid, the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We recently entered into a second five (5) year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT2 technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT2 gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	The agreement calls for sales of as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units and is valued up to $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 over the three-year term.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We intend to replicate this type of agreement with other large, regional gas engineering companies in Europe and North America as well as negotiating with several large Middle Eastern groups to place the device in the Gulf Region.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. (GIA), the global GC market will reach more than $1.5 billion by 2015.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Admittedly, that market is mature and, according to GIA, is dominated by aftermarket and accessories sales.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	In contrast, the GasPT2 Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	It provides almost real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P51_S4	Taking all of those factors into account, it is our intention that the GasPT2 Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $1.5 billion market.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in the form of innovative technology and potential strategic partners.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, most especially in the power industry, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including GasPT2, Novum and Solus.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	Moreover, much like when we acquired CUI, Inc., there are many small, well-run electronics companies that become available for multiple reasons.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P52_S4	We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies with our current business, along with the potential for increasing revenue and/or market share.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Research and development costs for CUI Global were approximately $1.2 million and $900 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs and the Solus Topology, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT2 and VE Probe technologies.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	The Company expects that research and development expenses will continue during 2015 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had two hundred full-time employees.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2014, none of its employees is represented by a labor union.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Company plans to add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained the relationship with the holder of the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Through an exclusive licensing contract with AnderMotion Technologies, LLC, signed on or about April 20, 2009, CUI acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute motion control devices utilizing the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Through a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Power-One, Inc., signed on or about September 18, 2009, CUI has access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into CUI s new line of digital point of load (POL) power modules.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with California Power Research, Inc., signed on or about March 4, 2010, CUI acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture, market, sell, lease, maintain, give over and dispose of licensed product using the BPS-5 advanced power topology technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., signed on or about January 4, 2010, CUI Global acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT2) designed by GL on a worldwide basis.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	On July 30, 2013 our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE-Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its GasPT2 and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, which maintains the International Register, and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we actively maintain up to date the following trademarks: CUI INC, CUI Europe, V-Infinity, AMT, Novum, CUI Global, Simple Digital, GasPT2, Solus, IRIS, Vergence and Orbital Gas Systems.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up to date protection of its intellectual property.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The industries in which the company competes are very broad.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	We operate a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitive pricing to differentiate our products from competitors.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of larger global firms.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We feel that our electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	We have a very strong retail distribution partner that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a $700 encoder all different products for different customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	Additionally, we utilize third party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new and better customers otherwise not readily available to the company.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	CUI is becoming more recognized in the power supply market and has differentiated itself through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our power and electro-mechanical segment accounted for approximately 64.01% of our revenues and our gas segment accounted for approximately 35.99% of our revenues.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	We have added new products and technologies that will provide us the opportunity to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	From the first full featured digital point-of-load dc-dc converter, to the highly dense intermediate bus converters that CUI recently released, we believe that we are ahead of the market leaders in our market space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	We feel that there is a market shift toward digitally-based controllers for power supply switching.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	Our strategy is to lead a transformation for the industry as it will become a major part of the value to the end customer as well as a data collection point for energy consumption, two important elements for the industry.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT2 along with our VE-Probe, competes in a mature industry with established competitors.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S3	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S4	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P73_S5	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as double the price of the GasPT2 system.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	In an industry first, CUI has chosen that, in addition to sales commission, sales representative firms will also receive a charity commission to be donated to charities of their choice.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	One of CUI s core values is generosity which includes philanthropic giving.
1108967_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	We give in our local community and we want to also give in the communities in which we do business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Investors should read carefully the following factors as well as the cautionary statements referred to in Forward-Looking Statements herein.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Historically, we have generated annual losses from operations and we may need additional funding in the future .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Historically, on an annual basis, we have not generated sufficient revenues from operations to self-fund our capital and operating requirements.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For the year ended 2014, we had a net loss of $2,801,278 and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 was $82,716,744.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are not able to generate sufficient income and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and growth plans, we may seek additional capital from equity and debt placements or corporate arrangements.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to technologies or products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to raise adequate funds or generate them from operations, it may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of its growth plans or liquidate some or all of our assets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a net loss of $2,801,278.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	There is no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we fail to achieve or sustain profitability, the price of our common stock could fall and our ability to raise additional capital could be adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have expanded our business activities and these activities may not be successful and may divert our resources from our existing business activities .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our historic business was a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In recent years, we have focused our business on the acquisition, development and commercialization of new and innovative electronic technologies/products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may not be successful in acquiring technologies that are commercially viable.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may fail to successfully develop or commercialize technologies that we acquire.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Research, development and commercialization of such acquired technologies may disproportionately divert our resources from our other business activities.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If our manufacturers or our suppliers are unable to provide an adequate supply of products, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We rely on third parties to supply components for and to manufacture our products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In order to grow our business to achieve profitability, we will need our manufacturers and suppliers to increase, or scale-up, production and supply by a significant factor over current levels.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	There are technical challenges to scaling-up capacity that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers or suppliers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary experience.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our manufacturers and suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to grow our business to anticipated levels.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	and if they become capacity constrained they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues depend on key customers and suppliers .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company s major product lines in 2014 and 2013 were power and electro-mechanical products and natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During 2012 the company s major product lines were power and electro-mechanical products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	During 2014, 52% of revenues were derived from three customers at 30%, 16% and 6%.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	During 2013, 50% of revenues were derived from two customers at 33% and 17%.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	During 2012, 51% of revenues were derived from two customers at 47% and 4%.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	At December 31, 2014, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $12.1 million, 38% was due from three customers: 16%, 13% and 9%.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	At December 31, 2013, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $9.3 million, 25% was due from one customer.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	At December 31, 2012, 45% of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $5.1 million, was due from two customers: 37% and 8%.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	During 2014, the Company had one supplier concentration of 11% related to inventory product received.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	With the United Kingdom operations of Orbital Gas Systems, the Company also has foreign revenue and trade accounts receivable concentrations in the United Kingdom of 34% and 46%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue to maintain all of our existing key customers in the future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Should we, for any reason, discontinue our business relationship with any one of these key customers, the impact to our revenue stream would be substantial.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We rely on third party distributors to generate a substantial part of our revenue and, if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our electronic component products through distributors and we expect that sales through these distributors will represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our ability to expand our distribution channels depends in part on our ability to educate our distributors about our products, which are complex.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Many of our distributors have established relationships with our competitors.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If our distributors choose to place greater emphasis on products and services of their own or those offered by our competitors, our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If our distributors do not effectively market and sell our products, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The loss of one or more of our larger distributors, who may cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our failure to recruit additional distributors or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products or conflicts between distributor sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are a relatively small specialty component and solutions business and face formidable competition .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We define our product offerings into two categories: Power and Electro-Mechanical Segment (power supply units) that includes our Novum Digital Power and Solus Advanced Power and components including our AMT modular encoder and our Gas Segment which includes the GasPT2, VE Probe and IRIS among other gas related products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our international competitors.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the specialty electronic component and solutions business that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We face formidable competition in every aspect of our specialty component and solutions business from other companies many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader product offerings than ours.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We also expect competition to intensify in the future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, the market for our electronic components and our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT2, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive environments.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We continue our process of integrating recent acquisitions into our own business model and we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The areas where we face risks include:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	other as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, a majority of Orbital Gas Systems Limited s revenues for each of its last two fiscal years has come from a few customers.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we fail to continue to do business with Orbital s primary customers at substantially similar or greater levels than recent historical levels, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be significantly harmed.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We will need to grow our organization and we may encounter diff culties in managing this growth .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had two hundred full-time employees.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products including the GasPT2, VE, IRIS, Novum and Solus advanced power products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our operating results will vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	the impact of write downs of excess and obsolete inventory.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our operating expenses will increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Historically, we limited our investment in operations, but in the future we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase substantially to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We are making significant investments in using more professional services and expanding our operations outside the United States.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We intend to make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, we may determine the need in the future to build a direct sales force to market and sell our products or provide additional resources or cooperative funds to our distributors.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We expect our increased investments to adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long term benefit.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of distributors, customers and end-users .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the electronic component market.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We expect the brand identity that we have developed through CUI, GasPT2, Orbital Gas Systems, IRIS, Novum, AMT, Solus and CUI Japan to significantly contribute to the success of our business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of distributors, customers and end-users.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, which we may not do successfully.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The markets for development, distribution and sale of our products are rapidly evolving.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which, in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S4	General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S7	It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	One of our subsidiaries and certain suppliers are in Japan and located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have research, development and manufacturing resources in Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The risk of earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, over which we have no control, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our location in Japan or a third-party provider could cause interruptions in the products that we provide.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Earthquakes, fire, flooding or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our development, manufacturing, assembly, testing or shipping capacity.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in product development or shipments of our products until we are able to shift our development, manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor or our research and development activities to another location.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Defects in our products could harm our reputation and business .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our electronic products are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Any defects or errors in our electronic products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	harm to our results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of electronic components or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of CUI Global and our subsidiary companies, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan as well as the development of our technologies, our business culture and our strategic direction.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Competition for personnel with these skills is intense.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P60_S4	We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We believe our future success will depend in part on the following:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We license a significant amount of our underlying intellectual property from third parties, i. e., AMT Encoder Technology, Novum Digital Point of Load Technology, Solus Advanced Power Topology Technology, GasPT2 Technology and VE-Technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P66_S6	Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S3	We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S4	In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P71_S2	These claims, whether or not successful, could:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	require us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Even if we have not infringed any third parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If our contract manufacturers do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Because most of our contract manufacturers operate outside the United States, where prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft is more difficult than in the United States, certain of our contract manufacturers, their affiliates, their other customers or their suppliers may attempt to use our intellectual property and trade secrets to manufacture our products for themselves or others without our knowledge.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Although we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The market price for the Company s common stock is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control, which means our market price could be depressed and could impair our ability to raise capital:
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Additionally, because our stock is thinly trading, there is a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock s true value.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Potential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by our existing line of credit, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol CUI .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our shares of common stock are thinly traded.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P87_S3	There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common shareholders and with the ability to adversely affect shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Although we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, including large blocks of preferred stock as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P89_S2	As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred shareholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Preferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P90_S3	The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it diff cult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The Company is a Colorado corporation.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	As permitted by Colorado law, the Company s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against a director.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our charter documents and note outstanding to IED, Inc. may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	do not provide for cumulative voting rights.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our operating subsidiary, CUI, Inc. issued a note to IED, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The note provides that, for so long as any obligations are outstanding under the note, IED will have a right to match any bona fide offer from a third party to acquire CUI, Inc. by any means.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	This matching right could discourage third parties from making an offer to acquire us, which would involve indirectly acquiring CUI, Inc., or from acquiring CUI, Inc. directly, in a transaction our shareholders might find advantageous because any such offer could be matched by IED and result in the third party utilizing time and resources to formulate an offer without being able to complete a transaction.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	A significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill, which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We have goodwill totaling approximately $8.9 million associated with the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We will be required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates, at least once a year.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P98_S2	This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P98_S3	These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	A portion of our revenue arises from our international operations and we anticipate that, as we grow, our revenues from international operations will increase.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in local currencies.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P100_S2	As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P100_S3	In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P100_S4	The Company does not undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT2, has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	There is no assurance our acquisition of Orbital will accelerate sales of the GasPT2 device .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT2 device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT2 device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT2 device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Several factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT2 device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT2 device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT2 device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Also, while our management is optimistic that the acquisition of Orbital will stimulate and accelerate sales of the GasPT2 device, there is no assurance that GasPT2 device sales will actually increase in the near future due to the Orbital acquisition.
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The loss of any of Orbital s key management or employees could harm Orbital s future business prospects .
1108967_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We will be dependent upon the existing management team and key employees of Orbital for the foreseeable future.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	If the patent is not issued, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	A change in the estimate of the patent having a future beneficial value to the Company will impact the other assets and expense accounts of the Company.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	For one distributor that comprises 30% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	For a different distributor arrangement that represents 4% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital Gas Systems in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	Of this increase, the Gas segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital Gas Systems for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	The Power and Electro-Mechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Further impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The 2013 change in cash provided by operations is primarily the result of the net loss during the year ended December 31, 2013 of $0.9 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Exclusive of those non-cash items, the net result for the year ended December 31, 2013 was positive approximately $3.3 million.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	The improvement in the net loss, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with 2012 is associated with the increase in revenues and related gross profits, both from the addition of Orbital Gas Systems Limited in April 2013 which contributed approximately $17.5 million of revenues during the last three quarters of 2013 and the growth in the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment of CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan which had increased revenues over the prior year of approximately $2.1 million.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	The increase in revenues through the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment is associated with growth in revenues through existing customers as well as to new customers, including Future Electronics which was added as a distribution channel during January 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	The growth in revenues and related gross profits was offset by the continued expenses to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, Solus and GasPT2, increased advertising costs for company products, new product introductions, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Orbital Gas Systems as well as the overall growth in expenses of the business in relation to the growth in revenues.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $1.7 million increase in inventory which is primarily a function of product held for scheduled customer orders.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	An increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets largely associated with prepaid license fees for future sales of the GasPT2 products and prepaid insurance premiums.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	Further, a payment of $1.8 million was issued toward an accrued obligation for services provided to Orbital.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The decrease in accrued taxes payable is primarily associated with payment of value-add-tax in the UK of $0.8 million.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	Unearned revenue and billings in excess of costs increased during the period, these are associated with several customer prepayments and deferred revenues including on certain power and electro-mechanical product sales through distribution.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The negative cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily the result of a larger net loss attributable to CUI Global, Inc. in 2012 of $2.5 million which included increased sales related travel for CUI, Inc. to manage third party sales representatives, reach new customers, maintain existing customers, and promote new product lines including Novum and Solus, professional fees expenses related to engineering support, testing fees and travel expenses related to the GasPT2 product as the Company increased the GasPT2 exposure to customers in North America, parts of Europe and elsewhere, increased expenses associated with being a public company such as filing services and fees, professional fees, and listing fees among others, increased advertising costs for company products, increased commissions to third party sales representatives related to the increase in sales, increased expenses associated with the growth in operations at CUI Japan, operating costs associated with the newer technologies Novum and Solus and the overall growth of the business in relation to revenues.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Additional factors that impacted the cash from operations in 2012 include increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory of $1.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The increase in trade accounts receivable is largely attributed to the increased revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $11.9 million.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	The increase in inventory is primarily related to the inventory on hand associated with the increased back log of customer orders at December 31, 2012 of $14.1 million and increased inventory of GasPT2 units on hand at year end to prevent potential shortages for future customer orders associated with manufacturing and calibration lead times.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company used stock and warrants as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, licensors and employees.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of stock compensation issued to consultants for strategic consulting services regarding the testing and demonstration of the Gas segment technologies and related strategic customer relations.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	Additional increases in equity compensation are related primarily to the equity compensation expenses associated with director and employee stock grants for performance and vesting expenses associated with options grants.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 is attributable to decreases in stock compensation expense for stock issued to consultants for strategic investor marketing services and employee stock compensation, offset by an increase in stock compensation expense for stock issued to a consultant for engineering and customer services provided and an increase in options related expenses for options granted to employees that expense over their associated vesting life.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	The increase in 2012 is attributable to increased stock compensation expense for stock issued to consultants for strategic investor marketing services, employee stock compensation and options expenses.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Additionally, in March 2015, the Company acquired the assets of Tectrol, Inc. which will be included in the operations of the power and electro-mechanical segment and will further contribute revenues to help cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	If revenues and the funds raised in 2012 and in April 2013 through the sales of equity are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P63_S4	The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The accompanying financial statements reflect the operations of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The increase in revenues during 2014 is attributable to the full year operations of Orbital Gas Systems Limited which was acquired in April 2013 (Gas segment) and accounts for approximately $9.5 million of the sales increase resulting from sales improvement during the second through fourth quarter periods and owning Orbital for the first quarter of 2014, in addition to increases through the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment of approximately $5.9 million which is the result of continued product introductions, sales and marketing efforts, further expansion through the distribution sales channel, and the increased back log of CUI orders on hand at December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The customer orders related to the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment (CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan) are associated with continued product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, continued growth within the distribution network of CUI products, and the strengthening within the electronic components industry.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Power and Electro-Mechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014 as compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $13.4 million as of December 31, 2013 and $11.7 million at December 31, 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	This decrease is reasonable given the overall growth within the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	At December 31, 2014, Orbital Gas Systems Limited held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $15.9 million as compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $25.0 million as of December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease in Orbital backlog is associated with several items, including the increase of approximately $3.3 million for the third and fourth quarter revenues of 2014 in comparison to 2013, and approximately $1.0 million change related to the changes in the Sterling Pound versus US Dollar exchange rate.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	Additionally, Orbital is still being affected by the restructuring of the UK operations of its largest customer related to the Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs (RIIO) program and other transformation related initiatives, which have significantly impacted that customer s ability to place large contract orders.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	CUI, Inc. introduced 937 new products during the year ended 2014.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI s sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The increase in revenues during 2013 is attributable to the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Limited in April 2013 (Gas segment) which accounts for approximately $17.5 million of the increase, in addition to increases through the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment of approximately $2.1 million which is the result of continued product introductions during 2013 and 2012, sales and marketing efforts, the addition of Future Electronics as a distribution channel following the global distribution agreement between CUI and Future Electronics that began in January 2013, and the increased back log of CUI orders on hand at December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	CUI introduced 808 new products during the year ended 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The growth in 2012 is primarily due to management s decision to continue to push smaller sales through the distribution sales channel and focus on larger value direct sales through the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment as well as the continued expansion of CUI s product offering and further penetration in the Japanese market through CUI Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	This change resulted in a 4.7% decrease in the total number of customer sales orders processed, while total revenues increased approximately $2.1 million, or 5.5% during 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	CUI introduced 207 new products within the Power and Electro-Mechanical segment during the year ended 2012.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The 2014 increase of approximately $6.6 million from 2013 is primarily the result of having Orbital Gas Systems included for the first quarter of 2014 SG A activities of Orbital which accounted for approximately $2.0 million of the increase, stock compensation expense of $1.7 million representing an increase of $1.1 million from 2013 related to stock issuances and vesting expense of options related to consultants for strategic services including customer marketing and investor relations, to directors and employees for services, as well as the overall increase in operations throughout the organization associated with increased revenues of approximately $15.4 million including continued investment in reaching new customers and markets and continuing existing customer relationships.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The SG A expenses increased $4.0 million between 2013 and 2012, primarily in relation to the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Limited in April 2013 and its ongoing operations which accounts for $4.4 million of the increase in addition to a decrease of $0.6 million in expenses for stock issuances and options expense related to employee compensation and issuances to consultants for strategic investor marketing services, engineering and sales services.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The SG A increase of approximately $2.9 million in 2012 is primarily in relation to an increase of $0.6 million of stock compensation expense for issuances to consultants related to strategic investor marketing services, an increase of approximately $0.4 million for investor relations related expenses including travel, supplies, conferences, meetings and cash expenses for strategic investor marketing services, an approximately $0.4 million increase in sales related travel for CUI, Inc. related sales activity to manage third party sales representatives, reach new customers, maintain existing customers and promote new product lines including Novum and Solus, an approximately $0.3 million increase for stock compensation expenses for issuances to officers and employees as bonuses for achieving corporate goals, an approximately $0.2 million increase in expenses associated with professional fees related to engineering support, testing fees and travel expenses related to the GasPT2 product as the Company increased the GasPT2 exposure to customers in North America, parts of Europe and elsewhere, $0.1 million increase in costs associated with being a public company such as filing services and fees, professional fees, and listing fees among others, increased costs associated with an increase in advertising for company products of approximately $35 thousand, increased commissions to third party sales representatives related to the increase in sales, growth in operations at CUI Japan associated with the increase in its revenues, operating costs associated with the newer technologies Novum and Solus and the overall growth of the business in relation to revenues.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The total dollar amount of SG A as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 34.27%, 32.15% and 37.71% respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company anticipates the amount of its sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will further increase in 2015 as the Company continues to grow and as it opens its North American branch of its Gas Segment operations.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Additional factors regarding the anticipated increase in SG A expenditures for 2015 include costs associated with the continued efforts to increase revenues, further expand distribution sales for the CUI Inc. product lines, continued work to penetrate the market with its newer product lines including GasPT2, VE, IRIS, Novum and Solus as well as seeks to continue to further its technology offerings.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately $4.4 million, $3.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The large increase in the depreciation and amortization expense between 2014 and 2013 is primarily the result of the increased amortization expense of $0.9 million associated with the identifiable intangible assets that were acquired during the second quarter of 2013 with Orbital Gas Systems Limited and amortize over their estimated useful lives, as well as the full years depreciation expense for tangible depreciating fixed assets at Orbital and the full years depreciation of the CUI Global headquarters building acquired in September 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	The large increase in the depreciation and amortization expense between 2013 and 2012 is primarily the result of the amortization expense of $2.2 million associated with the identifiable intangible assets that were acquired with Orbital Gas Systems in April 2013 and amortized over their useful lives, as well as the addition of depreciation expense for tangible depreciating fixed assets at Orbital.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company expects that 2015 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2014 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P85_S6	There were approximately $32 thousand, $0 and $0.3 million of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	The decrease in this expense during 2014 and 2013 is primarily associated with the completion in 2012 of the amortization of the discounts on debt related to the CUI Inc. acquisition in 2008 and the completion in 2013 of the amortization of the debt offering costs associated with Wells Fargo related debts.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million of interest expense during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	The decreases in 2013 and 2012 are the result of reductions in debts during both 2013 and 2012 through utilizing the proceeds from the sales of equity, offset somewhat during Q4 2013, due to interest on the promissory note for the headquarters acquisition in September 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	A net benefit of $0.7 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.59% for the year.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.4 million and 29.70%, respectively for the same period in 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	The income tax benefit in 2014 and 2013 relates primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	Our income tax expense and effective tax rate were $0.0 million and 1.35%, respectively for the same period in 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P94_S4	The income tax provision for 2012 relates primarily to state minimum taxes as all of our other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	We continue to record a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 as it is not more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	The loss in 2014 is largely attributable to several significant non-cash items that impacted profitability.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	A significant portion of the increase in non-cash related expense is the equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital Gas Systems in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million, while the gross profit margin decreased slightly to 37.54% from 38.75% which helped to offset these increased costs.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	Of this increase, the Gas segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital Gas Systems for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	The Power and Electro-Mechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	The loss in 2013 is largely attributable to the non-cash amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired with the April 2013 acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Total amortization of intangible assets during 2013 was approximately $2.5 million as compared to approximately $150 thousand in 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	Additionally, the Company recognized bad debt expense of $0.2 million for miscellaneous customer receivables for which collection is uncertain and $0.5 million for the impairment of note receivable relative to the remaining balance of the note receivable for the divestment of CUI Global s 49% interest in Comex in 2011.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	Exclusive of those items, the Company showed significant improvement as compared to 2012 which is the result of the increase in revenues through CUI Inc. and CUI Japan of approximately $2.1 million as well as the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems in April 2013 which contributed approximately $17.5 million to revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S4	The company improved its gross profit margin during 2013 to 38.75% from 36.82% in 2012 and significantly improved its selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue from 37.71% in 2012 to 32.15% in 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P98_S5	Additionally, with the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Limited, the Company experienced an increase in income tax related expenses primarily related to the United Kingdom as the amortization of intangibles expenses are not allowed under U.K. tax rules.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The loss in 2012, was primarily the result of increased total revenues of approximately $2.1 million, offset by increases in cost of revenues of approximately $1.6 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.9.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

1108967_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and is to be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	This ASU had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Credit Carryforward Exists.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	ASU No 2013-11 provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carry forward exists.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	The adoption of this provision had no impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P103_S3	The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).
1108967_15_ITEM7_P103_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (ASU 2014-12).
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S4	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S5	If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S6	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S7	The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P104_S8	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim period within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, early adoption is permitted.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-12 on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (ASU 2015-01).
1108967_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1108967_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	The adoption of this provision is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The following sections provide quantitative information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling and the Japanese yen.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., U.K. and Japanese operations, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Revenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013:
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	1 On April 18, 2013, we closed on our share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited which was effective April 1, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The Company believes, that during fiscal ended December 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia , provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our Investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compiles a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are diversified and maintained with several financial institutions.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
1108967_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The Company has trade receivable and revenues concentrations with large customers, which include a large concentration of trade receivables and revenues in the United Kingdom.
1108967_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Financial Statements and the report of Perkins Company, P.C. and the report of Liggett, Vogt Webb, P.A., are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
1108967_15_ITEM9_P0_S0	Effective April 2, 2014, the CUI Global terminated its relationship with the Independent Registered Accounting Firm Liggett, Vogt and Webb, P.A. ( LVW ).
1108967_15_ITEM9_P0_S1	The Company had no disagreements with LVW as the Company s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure during the time in which LVW served the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM9_P1_S0	The Company has had no disagreements with Perkins Company, P. C. as the Company s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon that evaluation, the Company's management, including the CEO and the CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	This result is due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review of contracts that fall outside of standard terms and conditions for proper revenue recognition at our subsidiary Orbital Gas Systems Limited.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of CUI Global, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of such inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( 2013 framework ).
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	After conducting the assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of the material weakness described below.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting:
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	- The Company had implemented a control at our subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems Limited, in the fourth quarter of 2014 that was designed to ensure all contracts outside of standard terms and conditions were being reviewed by qualified personnel for proper revenue recognition treatment under US GAAP, however, contracts prior to the implementation were not covered by this control.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Accordingly, the control was not designed and operating effectively at December 31, 2014 to prevent a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, has been audited by Perkins Company, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm who also has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Perkins Company, P.C. s report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting and the consolidated financial statements appears in this Annual Report.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, Management took specific steps to address the material weaknesses described in the 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	These measures include the implementation of the overall internal control over financial reporting procedures at Orbital Gas Systems Limited, the implementation of appropriate controls and procedures around percentage of completion revenue recognition, removal of Super User accounting system access rights by CFO, segregation of authorities over cash account access and rights therein, improvements made toward revenue recognition related to distribution agreements, implementation of new internal controls and procedures to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting specifically with regard to acquisition accounting requirements for purchase price allocation of deferred tax liabilities.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Subsequent to December 31, 2014, management has already implemented additional procedures to ensure any outstanding contracts existing prior to the contract review control implementation are properly reviewed and expects the material weakness to be fully resolved during the first quarter of 2015.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We have audited CUI Global Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P12_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P12_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P12_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P15_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P15_S1	A material weakness regarding management s failure to design and maintain controls at its subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems Limited, to ensure all contracts outside of standard terms and conditions were being reviewed by qualified Company personnel for proper revenue recognition treatment under US GAAP has been identified and described in management s assessment .
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P15_S2	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 16, 2015, on those consolidated financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P16_S0	In our opinion, CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P17_S0	We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management s assessment.
1108967_15_ITEM9A_P18_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our report dated March 16, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1108967_15_ITEM9B_P0_S0	There are no matters to be reported under this Item.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P0_S0	Our Bylaws permit the number of directors to be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors, but to be no less than one.

1108967_15_ITEM10_P28_S3	Charter of the Audit Committee, Charter of the Compensation Committee, policy for Director Independence, Nominating Committee guide, Disclosure Controls and Procedures and, most recently adopted, Whistleblower Policy, all of which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, form the framework for our corporate governance.

1108967_15_ITEM10_P30_S0	The Board of Directors and its committees have an important role in the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment process.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P30_S1	The board regularly reviews with management the Company s financial and business strategies which include a discussion of relevant material risks as appropriate.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P30_S2	The board discusses with the Company s outside general counsel, as appropriate, its risk oversight and assessment as well as any material risks to the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P30_S3	In addition, the board delegates risk management responsibilities to the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, which committees are each all comprised of independent directors.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P31_S0	The Audit Committee, as part of its charter, oversees the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment of the Company and oversees and assesses the risks associated with the corporate governance and ethics of the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P31_S1	Risk considerations are a material aspect of the Compensation Committee.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P32_S0	The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to executive compensation.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P32_S1	In addition, the Compensation Committee also, as appropriate, assesses the risks relating to the Company s overall compensation programs.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P32_S2	While the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee oversee the management of the risk areas identified above, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P32_S3	This enables the board and its committees to coordinate the risk management, assessment and oversight roles.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P33_S0	Our Board of Directors has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines to establish a framework within which it will conduct its business and to guide management in its running of your Company.

1108967_15_ITEM10_P74_S0	Our Compensation Committee meets formally and informally as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P74_S1	The Compensation Committee held one formal meeting during fiscal 2014.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P75_S0	On an as requested basis, our Compensation Committee receives and reviews materials prepared by management, consultants or committee members, in advance of each meeting.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P75_S1	Depending on the agenda for the particular meeting, these materials may include:

1108967_15_ITEM10_P77_S0	Our Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P78_S0	None of the members of the Company s Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the last completed fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P78_S1	None of the Company s executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on the Company s board of directors or Compensation Committee during the last completed fiscal year.
1108967_15_ITEM10_P79_S0	We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the proxy statement on Schedule 14A for the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P0_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P0_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P0_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P1_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P1_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P2_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P2_S1	Long term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock or stock options.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P2_S2	These awards generally vest over a two to four year period.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P2_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long term strategic goals.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P3_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P3_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P4_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P5_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P5_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_15_ITEM11_P6_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P7_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on Company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, for the board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the Board of Directors.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P8_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P8_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at or near the compensation of peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P8_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at that of peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P9_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management annually to the Board of Directors.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P9_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving the same.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P10_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P10_S2	In 2014, these non-financial performance goals and objectives included the continued integration of Orbital Gas Systems Limited; identification and signing of third party sales representative agencies to support the expansion within the global natural gas market, continued expansion of sales through the distribution channel for CUI, Inc. products; continued product development and new product introductions; and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P10_S3	In addition, such factors as revenue growth and new product adoption were and are considered in setting compensation levels.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual Company performance relative to the targets set as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally following the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the Board of Directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P11_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P12_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P13_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P14_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P15_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P16_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends therefrom.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P17_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P17_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P18_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P18_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: (i) the Company s EBIDTA; (ii) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and (iii) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P19_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P19_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P19_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management s proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P19_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P20_S0	Incentive awards are paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P20_S1	The incentive award targets for the executives are established at the beginning of the year, generally, as a percentage of their base salary and the actual awards are determined at the following year s annual board of directors meetings based on actual Company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P20_S2	In many instances the award of restricted common stock vests over a four year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P20_S3	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price of no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P20_S4	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P21_S0	Our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI, Inc., maintains a 401(k) plan.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P22_S0	The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute to the plan after they have completed 2 months of service and are 21 years of age.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P22_S1	The Company matches the employee s contribution up to 6% of total compensation.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P22_S2	CUI, Inc. made total employer contributions, net of forfeitures, of $271,813, $245,594 and $215,118 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1108967_15_ITEM11_P23_S2	Orbital made total employer contributions of $255,773 during 2014 and $106,121 during the period from April 1, 2013 thru December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P24_S0	Our executives are awarded protection upon a change in control as specifically provided in their employment contracts.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P24_S1	The Chief Executive Officer contract includes a provision for a three year severance package upon termination.
1108967_15_ITEM11_P24_S2	The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer contracts include a provision for an eighteen month severance package upon termination.

1108967_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Prior-period amounts have been revised to reflect an immaterial adjustment of deferred tax temporary differences and stockholders equity (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Adjustment of Prior Period Balances and Note 15.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	CUI, Inc. is based in Tualatin, Oregon and CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Both CUI, Inc. (CUI) and CUI Japan are providers of electro-mechanical components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P37_S3	CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Through CUI s capabilities and extensive contacts throughout Asia, this acquisition allows CUI Global to continue to identify, acquire and commercialize new proprietary technologies.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	CUI Global will use CUI s market partners and global distribution capabilities to bring other products to market, including the Novum and Solus power products, and other proprietary devices, described below.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	CUI s testing and R D capabilities allow CUI Global to commercialize and prototype its products more efficiently and economically.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	CUI and CUI Japan define their product offering into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions which include Novum and Solus.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	In April 2013, CUI Global acquired 100% of the capital stock of Orbital Gas Systems Limited (Orbital), a United Kingdom-based provider of natural gas infrastructure and advanced technology, including metering, odorization, remote telemetry units ( RTU ) and a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	The GasPT2 technology products are sold through Orbital.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, total revenues at CUI Global consisted of 64% from CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan and 36% from Orbital.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2014 and 2013 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, CUI Properties, LLC and Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (included since April 1, 2013), hereafter referred to as the Company .
1108967_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	The consolidated financial statements for 2012 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company revised its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2012 by recording a deferred tax liability of $2.8 million associated with a prior acquisition and a resulting offset increasing the Company s accumulated deficit since the effect of the correction relates to years prior to 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	The consolidated balance sheets for December 31, 2013 and 2012 presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect this change.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The result of this correction did not affect the Company s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and loss or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	Management made the revisions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements because recording the correction in 2014 would have been material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	In addition, management identified an error in its tax filings since 2008 related to overstated tax deductions for amortization on acquired intangibles and goodwill for which no tax basis existed.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	Management determined that the deductions overstated net operating loss carryforwards and the associated valuation allowance, which had been previously disclosed.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P46_S2	The Company determined that no impact other than disclosure would result from the correction of the overstated net operating loss carryforwards which have been subject to a full valuation allowance.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P46_S3	The reversal of the overstated deferred tax assets representing net operating loss carryforwards, would be completely offset by a reduction in existing valuation allowances for the same previous years.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P46_S4	The Company has revised its income tax footnote disclosure as of January 1, 2012, to reflect these revisions to its deferred tax assets, valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities with the corresponding impact flowing through in subsequent disclosures.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
1108967_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Level 1 Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted for similar assets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	Level 2 includes assets or liabilities valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities; that is, the inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, billings in excess of costs, unearned revenue, and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	Mortgage debt and related notes payable approximate fair value based on current market conditions.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company measures its derivative liability on a recurring basis using significant observable inputs (Level 2).
1108967_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company s derivative liability is valued using a LIBOR swap curve.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S3	Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S4	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $2,090,952 and $2,964,871, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $132,022 and $137,156, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC).
1108967_15_ITEM15_P53_S5	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company held $64,411 and $108,747, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $2,531,689 and $6,984,417, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company considers all investments with original maturities over 90 days that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date to be short-term investments.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Short-term investments primarily include money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes, and commercial paper.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	Under this method, dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, CUI Global had $11,159,765 and $10,868,961, respectively, of short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity, which are reported at amortized cost, which approximates market.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $6,845,000 and $9,750,000, respectively of investments in certificates of deposit which were covered under FDIC insured limits and covered under $500,000 of SIPC insured programs for investments.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with revenue derived from product sales.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $253,871 and $285,348 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is considered adequate.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P57_S3	The reserve in both periods takes into account aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P57_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of the CUI, Inc. foreign customer receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Inventories consist of finished and un-finished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market; using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	At December 31, 2014, and 2013, inventory is valued, net of allowances, at $6,840,845 and $7,027,644, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	The allowances for inventory were $394,165 and $549,981 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company provides allowances for inventories estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company s estimation process for assessing the net realizable value is based upon its known backlog, projected future demand, historical usage and expected market conditions.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	At December 31, 2014, before allowance, the Company had finished goods of $5,610,039 and raw materials of $1,624,971.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	At December 31, 2013, before allowance, the Company had finished goods of $5,776,916, raw materials of $1,290,851, and work in process of $509,858.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	Land is recorded at cost and includes expenditures made to ready it for use.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	Land is considered to have an infinite useful life.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Buildings and improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Furniture, vehicles, equipment and software are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term, estimated useful life, or 10 years.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The cost of buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, equipment, and software is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	The estimated useful lives for land, buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, equipment, and software are as follows:
1108967_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	When furniture, vehicles and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	Long-lived assets including indefinite lived identifiable assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long -lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P73_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third party experts.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The following are the estimated useful life for the intangible assets:
1108967_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	* Technology rights are amortized over a twenty year life or the term of the rights agreement.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	** Patents are amortized over the life of the patent.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	Any patents not approved will be expensed at that time.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	Other intangible assets are amortized over an appropriate useful life, as determined by management in relation to the other intangible asset characteristics.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	**** Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and when circumstances suggest.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company tests for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	In accordance with its policies, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill at May 31, 2014, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	In 2012, 2013 and 2014, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P90_S3	Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.

1108967_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company estimates the patents it has filed have a future beneficial value; therefore it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	At the time the patent is approved, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	If the patent is not approved, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company uses various derivative instruments including forward currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage certain exposures.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	These instruments are entered into under the Company s corporate risk management policy to minimize exposure and are not for speculative trading purposes.

1108967_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P129_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P129_S3	The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).

1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S2	A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S3	The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S4	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S5	If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S6	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S7	The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P130_S8	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim period within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, early adoption is permitted.

1108967_15_ITEM15_P247_S2	The consolidated balance sheets for December 31, 2013 and 2012 presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect this change.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P247_S3	The result of this correction did not affect the Company s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and loss or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P247_S4	Accordingly, management believes that the effect of the correction represents an immaterial adjustment to the accompanying consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P247_S5	Management made the revisions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements because recording the correction in 2014 would have been material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	In addition, the Company determined that no impact other than disclosure would result from the correction of the overstated net operating loss carryforwards which have been subject to a full valuation allowance.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	The reversal of the overstated deferred tax assets representing net operating loss carryforwards, would be completely offset by a reduction in existing valuation allowances for the same previous years.
1108967_15_ITEM15_P248_S2	The Company has revised its income tax footnote disclosure as of January 1, 2012, to reflect these revisions to its deferred tax assets, valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities with the corresponding impact flowing through in subsequent disclosures.

1108967_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	In an environment where OEMs are working to reduce their approved vendor list, the capability to deliver a full system solution is becoming critical.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2014, CUI, Ericsson Power Modules and Murata announced the formation of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) consortium.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	The goal of the AMP alliance is to realize the most technically advanced, end-to-end solutions and provide a complete ecosystem of hardware, software and support.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Beyond purely mechanical specifications, it is the standardization of monitoring, control and communications functions, and the creation of common configuration files for plug-and-play interoperability that will ensure compatibility between each firms products.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The company has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as opposed to optical or magnetic encoding.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	This unique device allows breakthroughs in selectable resolution, shaft-adaptation and convenient mounting solutions to bring ease of installation, reduction in SKU s and economies of scale in purchasing.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	The AMT amounts to almost 2000 different encoders in one package.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	The company is selling and distributing the AMT through various customers.

1108967_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Effective April 1, 2013, CUI Global closed on a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales ( Orbital ), from Orbital s sole shareholder.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	In 2015, the Company started up a North America subsidiary to its Orbital business.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Orbital is the largest natural gas systems integrator in the U.K. and has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 25 years.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	In addition, Orbital is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the U.K. and one of the most respected specialized gas engineering companies in the world.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Orbital has developed its portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	Moreover, its proprietary VE Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT Technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV-GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.)( GL ), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Company has minimum commitments under this licensing contract.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT, is a low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z).
1108967_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US and NMi The International Organization of Legal Metrology ( OIML ) for SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs ( GC ), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the price of the GasPT.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Those injection points will continue to use GC s for monitoring.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	On the other hand, there are 2,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	In addition, there are currently 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPTi Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with much cleaner emissions.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P29_S4	It is this greater efficiency that has lead National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, cancelling orders for several GC s and, in October 2013, replacing those GC s with an order for eight (8) GasPTi devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	In conjunction with the Orbital acquisition, we have moved the entire GasPT technology portfolio, along with the VE-Probe, into Orbital s product division, Orbital Global Solutions (Orbital-GS).
1108967_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Orbital-GS has successfully introduced the combined GasPT unit and VE-Probe to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	In January 2012 the company entered into a five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	SOCRATE is the vendor-of-choice for SNAM RETE GAS ( SRG ) and was referred to the company by SRG.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	SOCRATE continues to be involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system has concluded 24 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	On September 3, 2015, SRG issued a public tender for the installation of a minimum of 3,300 metering devices to change the way SRG monitors its facilities and assets.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	After a several month bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) pursuant to the tender.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Following the acquisition of Orbital and the transfer of gas operations to Orbital-GS, the company has entered into a series of 42 Distribution Agreements with internationally recognized entities in the natural gas industry.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	These agreements are designed to supplement and enhance our previously announced and continuing agreements with BENCHMARK, IVES EQUIPMENT, SOCRATE and others.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	On July 30, 2013 our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE-Probe, which is able to provide a gas sample from a high pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	The GasPTi system is able to accurately provide almost real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Moreover, it provides this real-time analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	This VE Technology acquisition gives us the ability to control and produce the entire Bill of Materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a far larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Additionally, we can now also manufacture, market and sell additional applications for the VE Technology , including sampling systems separate from the GasPT and Thermowells found throughout all pipeline systems.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	In addition, the VE Technology , in combination with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H 0), and hydrogen sulfide (H S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	We hope to grow our electromechanical product line through a planned strategy to increase our name recognition as a technology company.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our plan, already in effect, includes:
1108967_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Developing collaborative relationships with our customers by seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Developing new technologies and expanded manufacturing capabilities as needed.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Growing our global sales and distribution through our primary international distribution channel, a prominent international sales and distribution strategic partner that ships product to more than 170 countries worldwide from a single location in the United States.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributor with partnership marketing.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S4	The expansion means more manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P46_S5	We intend to eventually have field application engineers in the strategic areas driving designs at the customers facility.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our strategy for GasPT has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our sale or return sales approach has been accepted very positively in Europe and the United States.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	For the past three years, this approach focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States and the Company will continue its efforts in those areas as well as begin the process in the Asian markets, with India identified as the test market.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd., the largest specialty gas engineering company in England, introduced the combined GasPT unit and V-Probe to National Grid, the largest gas transmission/distribution company in the UK.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	We entered into a second five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	According to the latest industry analysts (including MarketsandMarkets ), the global GC market reached $2,583.6 million in 2014 and is poised to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2014 to 2019, reaching $3,605.1 million by 2019.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Admittedly, that market is mature and is dominated by aftermarket and accessories sales.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	In contrast, the GasPT Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	It provides almost real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	Taking all of those factors into account, it is our intention that the GasPT Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $2.5+ billion market.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are constantly alert to potential acquisition targets, both in the form of innovative technology and potential strategic partners.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	In that regard, we are repeatedly approached by inventors and others, most especially in the power industry, to assess and assist in commercialization and marketing of new technologies.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	These contacts largely arise because of our reputation and successes as well as our recent technology product line additions including GasPT, and Novum.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Moreover, much like when we acquired CUI, Inc., there are many small, well-run electronics companies that become available for multiple reasons.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	We will consider each of these potential opportunities as they arise with a careful analysis of the relevant synergies with our current business, along with the potential for increasing revenue and/or market share.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Research and development costs for CUI Global were approximately $1.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE Probe technologies.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The Company expects that research and development expenses will continue during 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 352 employees.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	As of December 31, 2015, 78 of its employees in Canada are represented by a labor union.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	The increase in the number of employees compared to the 200 reported as of December 31, 2014 is primarily a result of the 2015 CUI Canada acquisition and the 2015 startup of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd., North America.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The Company plans to add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Upon the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained the relationship with the holder of the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Through an exclusive licensing contract with AnderMotion Technologies, LLC, signed on or about April 20, 2009, CUI acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute motion control devices utilizing the AMT encoder technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Through a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Power-One, Inc., signed on or about September 18, 2009, CUI has access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into CUI s new line of digital point of load (POL) power modules.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd. (GL), formerly British-based Advantica, Ltd., signed on or about January 4, 2010, CUI Global acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	On July 30, 2013 our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The agreement gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, which maintains the International Register, and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we actively maintain up to date the following trademarks: CUI INC, CUI Europe, V-Infinity, AMT, Novum, CUI Global, Simple Digital, GasPT, IRIS, Vergence and Orbital Gas Systems.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up to date protection of its intellectual property.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	The industries in which the company competes are very broad.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	We operate a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitive pricing to differentiate our products from competitors.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of larger global firms.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	We feel that our electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	We have a very strong retail distribution partner that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a $700 encoder all different products for different customers.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Additionally, we utilize third party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new and better customers otherwise not readily available to the company.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	CUI is becoming more recognized in the power supply market and has differentiated itself through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2015, our power and electromechanical segment accounted for approximately 67.5% of our revenues and our Energy segment accounted for approximately 32.5% of our revenues.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	We have added new products and technologies that will provide us the opportunity to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	From our portfolio of full-featured digital point-of-load dc-dc converters, to our line of Platinum-rated front-end power supplies, we believe that we are ahead of the market leaders in our space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	With the shift toward digitally-based power supplies accelerating, our strategy is to develop a true software defined power ecosystem where the sum of the components is greater than its parts.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE-Probe, competes in a mature industry with established competitors.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising four components: methane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P69_S5	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as double the price of the GasPT system.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	In an industry first, CUI has chosen that, in addition to sales commission, sales representative firms will also receive a charity commission to be donated to charities of their choice.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	One of CUI s core values is generosity, which includes philanthropic giving.
1108967_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	We give in our local community and we want to also give in the communities in which we do business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Investors should read carefully the following factors as well as the cautionary statements referred to in Forward-Looking Statements herein.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Historically, we have generated annual losses from operations and we may need additional funding in the future .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Historically, on an annual basis, we have not generated sufficient revenues from operations to self-fund our capital and operating requirements.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For the year ended 2015, we had a net loss of $6.0 million and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2015 was $88.7 million.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are not able to generate sufficient income and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and growth plans, we may seek additional capital from equity and debt placements or corporate arrangements.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to technologies or products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to raise adequate funds or generate them from operations, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of our growth plans or liquidate some or all of our assets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $6.0 million.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	There is no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we fail to achieve or sustain profitability, the price of our common stock could fall and our ability to raise additional capital could be adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have expanded our business activities and these activities may not be successful and may divert our resources from our existing business activities .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our historical business was a commoditized electromechanical parts distribution business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In recent years, we have focused our business on the acquisition, development and commercialization of new and innovative electronic technologies/products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may not be successful in acquiring technologies that are commercially viable.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may fail to successfully develop or commercialize technologies that we acquire.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Research, development and commercialization of such acquired technologies may disproportionately divert our resources from our other business activities.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If our manufacturers or our suppliers are unable to provide an adequate supply of products, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We rely on third parties to supply components for and to manufacture our products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In order to grow our business to achieve profitability, we will need our manufacturers and suppliers to increase, or scale-up, production and supply by a significant factor over current levels.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	There are technical challenges to scaling-up capacity that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers or suppliers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary experience.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our manufacturers and suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to grow our business to anticipated levels.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also may represent only a small portion of our supplier s or manufacturer s business, and if they become capacity constrained, they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues depend on key customers and suppliers .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company s major product lines in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were power and electromechanical products and natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During 2015, over 31% of revenues were derived from two customers, Digikey Electronics at 20%, and National Grid at 11%.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	During 2014, 46% of revenues were derived from two customers, Digikey Electronics at 30%, and National Grid at 16%.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	During 2013, 50% of revenues were derived from two customers, Digikey Electronics at 33% and National Grid at 17%.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	At December 31, 2015, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $14.8 million, 11% was due from one customer: National Grid.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	At December 31, 2014, of the gross trade accounts receivable totaling approximately $10.2 million, 34% was due from two customers in the Energy segment: National Grid at 19% and Scotia Gas Networks plc at 15% and 10% was from a customer in the Power and Electromechanical segment:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	During 2014, the Company had one supplier concentration of 11% related to inventory product received.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	With the United Kingdom operations of Orbital, the Company also has foreign revenue and trade accounts receivable concentrations in the United Kingdom of 25% and 28%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 34% and 54%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue to maintain all of our existing key customers in the future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Should we, for any reason, discontinue our business relationship with any one of these key customers, the impact to our revenue stream would be substantial.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	For additional information on our concentrations, see note 17 Concentrations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on third-party distributors to generate a substantial part of our revenue and, if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our electronic component products through distributors and we expect that sales through these distributors will represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our ability to expand our distribution channels depends in part on our ability to educate our distributors about our products, which are complex.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Many of our distributors have established relationships with our competitors.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If our distributors choose to place greater emphasis on products and services of their own or those offered by our competitors, our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If our distributors do not effectively market and sell our products, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The loss of one or more of our larger distributors, which may cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our failure to recruit additional distributors or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products or conflicts between distributor sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are a relatively small specialty component and solutions business and face formidable competition .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We define our product offerings into two categories: Power and Electromechanical Segment (power supply units) that includes our Novum Digital Power and components including our AMT modular encoder and our Energy Segment , which includes the GasPT, VE Probe and IRIS among other energy related products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our international competitors.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the specialty electronic component and solutions business that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We face formidable competition in every aspect of our specialty component and solutions business from other companies many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader product offerings than ours.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We also expect competition to intensify in the future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For example, the market for our electronic components and our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products with evolving industry standards and protocols in a competitive environment.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We continue our process of integrating recent acquisitions into our own business model and we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The areas where we face risks include:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	other as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, a majority of Orbital s revenues for each of its last two fiscal years has come from a few customers.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If we fail to continue to do business with Orbital s primary customers at substantially similar or greater levels than recent historical levels, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be significantly harmed.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We will need to grow our organization and we may encounter diff culties in managing this growth .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had approximately 350 full-time employees, which is an increase of approximately 150 from the prior year-end.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products including the GasPT, VE, IRIS, and Novum advanced power products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operating results will vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	the impact of write downs of excess and obsolete inventory.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our operating expenses will increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Historically, we limited our investment in operations, but in the future we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase substantially to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We are making significant investments in using more professional services and expanding our operations outside the United States.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We intend to make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, we may determine the need in the future to build a direct sales force to market and sell our products or provide additional resources or cooperative funds to our distributors.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We expect our increased investments to adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long-term benefit.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of distributors, customers and end-users .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in the electronic component market.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We expect the brand identity that we have developed through CUI, GasPT, Orbital Gas Systems, IRIS, Novum, AMT, and CUI Japan to significantly contribute to the success of our business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of distributors, customers and end-users.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, which we may not do successfully.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The markets for development, distribution and sale of our products are rapidly evolving.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S7	It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	One of our subsidiaries and certain suppliers are in Japan and located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have sales, development and manufacturing resources in Japan.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The risk of earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems, at our location in Japan or a third-party provider could cause interruptions in the products that we provide.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Defects in our products could harm our reputation and business .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our electronic products are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Any defects or errors in our electronic products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	harm to our results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of CUI Global and our subsidiary companies, Orbital, Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, and CUI Canada as well as the development of our technologies, our business culture and our strategic direction.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Competition for personnel with these skills is intense.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We believe our future success will depend in part on the following:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We license a significant amount of our underlying intellectual property from third parties, i.e., AMT Encoder Technology, Novum Digital Point of Load Technology, GasPT Technology and VE Technology .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P65_S6	Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S4	In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	These claims, whether or not successful, could:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	require us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Even if we have not infringed any third parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If our contract manufacturers do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Because most of our contract manufacturers operate outside the United States, where prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft is more difficult than in the United States, certain of our contract manufacturers, their affiliates, their other customers or their suppliers may attempt to use our intellectual property and trade secrets to manufacture our products for themselves or others without our knowledge.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Although we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The market price for the Company s common stock is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control, which means our market price could be depressed and could impair our ability to raise capital:
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Additionally, because the trading volume of our stock is not large, there can be a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock s true value.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Potential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by our existing line of credit, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol CUI.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Our shares of common stock are thinly traded.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P86_S3	There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P86_S4	Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common shareholders and with the ability to adversely affect shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Although we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred shareholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Preferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P89_S3	The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it diff cult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The Company is a Colorado corporation.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As permitted by Colorado law, the Company s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against a director.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our charter documents and note outstanding to IED, Inc. may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	do not provide for cumulative voting rights.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our operating subsidiary, CUI, Inc. issued a note to IED, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The note provides that, for so long as any obligations are outstanding under the note, IED will have a right to match any bona fide offer from a third party to acquire CUI, Inc. by any means.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P95_S2	This matching right could discourage third parties from making an offer to acquire us, which would involve indirectly acquiring CUI, Inc., or from acquiring CUI, Inc. directly, in a transaction our shareholders might find advantageous because any such offer could be matched by IED and result in the third party utilizing time and resources to formulate an offer without being able to complete a transaction.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A significant portion of our total assets at Orbital Gas Systems Limited consists of goodwill, which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We have goodwill totaling approximately $8.5 million associated with the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We are required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates, at least once a year.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P97_S3	These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	A portion of our revenue arises from our international operations and we anticipate that, as we grow, our revenues from international operations will increase.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in foreign currencies.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P99_S2	As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P99_S3	In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P99_S4	The Company does not currently undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT sold by Orbital Gas Systems Ltd., has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P100_S1	There is no assurance our acquisition of Orbital will accelerate sales of the GasPT device .
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Several factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P103_S1	While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.
1108967_16_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Also, while our management is optimistic that the acquisition of Orbital will stimulate and accelerate sales of the GasPT device, there is no assurance that GasPT device sales will actually increase in the near future due to the Orbital acquisition.
1108967_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	During September, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Properties, LLC, signed closing documents on the purchase of our Tualatin, Oregon corporate office real estate located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue in the Tualatin Franklin Business Park.

1108967_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	The purchase price for this acquisition was $5,050,000 and was partially funded by a promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $3,693,750 plus interest at the rate of 2.0% above LIBOR, payable over ten years.
1108967_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	In January 2015, the Company entered into a three-year lease for our 13,175 square foot Houston facility.

1108967_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	This enhanced onsite facility has enabled the Company to give notice on an additional building it was leasing for manufacturing and office space requirements.
1108967_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	Additionally, CUI Japan has leased space in Tokyo, Japan used as a sales office.
1108967_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company has enough manufacturing and office capacity to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Company s principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	While all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S-based website into Japanese.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	No other impairment of other long-lived assets were identified as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified an indefinite-lived intangible technology rights asset for which its expected life was reduced and an impairment of $32 thousand was recorded.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, management recorded an impairment of $0.5 million for the remaining balance of a note receivable from the divestment of Comex Electronics.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, ``Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Company s qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2015, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	In accordance with its policies, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill at May 31, 2015, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Employee stock compensation is recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Pricing Model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	With regards to the January 2014 options grant, the Company determined expected volatility by reviewing historical share prices for CUI Global for the most recent 12-month period.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	We determined that the most recent 12-month period of stock price fluctuations best reflected the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options due to the significant changes to the Company, including the 2013 equity raise, acquisition of Orbital, increased institutional ownership and other such factors that have impacted volatility.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S6	For the August 2014 options grant, the Company extended the volatility historical period to twenty months as the Company had remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P19_S7	The Company may continue to change its expected volatility factor to include a longer historical period, once the Company has remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Each of these methods may produce a different result.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Product revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	For one distributor that comprises 20% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	For two other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 7% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	For Production-type contracts meeting the Company s minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts ( ASC 605-35 ).
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as Costs in excess of billings, an asset account, or Billings in excess of costs, a liability account.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Production type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	For product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2015, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Operations, other intangible assets, investments, equipment and our acquisition and startup, have been funded through cash on hand during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operating requirements generated negative cash flow from operations of approximately $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and negative cash flow from operations of approximately $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, versus positive cash flow from operations of approximately $1.7 million for the same period in 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Negative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.3 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to negative cash flow from operations of $3.1 million for 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.4 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $1.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI Canada.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Accrued expenses increased $1.9 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the power and electro-mechanical segment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	During 2015, CUI Global recorded two significant non-cash entries: $0.2 million for provision for bad debt expense and $0.5 million of deferred income tax benefit.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	During 2015 and 2014 and 2013, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	For years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded a total of $1.3 million, $1.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to less stock paid to consultants in 2015 compared to 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of stock compensation issued to consultants for strategic consulting services regarding the testing and demonstration of the Energy segment technologies and related strategic customer relations.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	Additional increases in equity compensation in 2014 are related primarily to the equity compensation expenses associated with director and employee stock grants for performance and vesting expenses associated with options grants.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million and increased gross profits $5.0 million, which contributed to covering operating requirements.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Of this increase in revenues, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Further impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables and billings in excess of costs of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	During 2014, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $1.3 million to costs in excess of billings associated with progress on the related projects, increased prepaid expenses of $1.0 million associated primarily with prepaid royalties increases of $0.4 million and increased prepaid taxes of $0.4 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Unearned revenue increased $0.5 million associated with the timing of related customer orders and the terms granted.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Billings in excess decreased $2.9 million during the year related to progress on Energy segment projects.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	During 2014, CUI Global recorded two significant non-cash entries, $0.2 million for the unrealized loss on derivative and $0.7 million deferred income taxes benefit.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The 2013 change in cash provided by operations is primarily the result of the net loss during the year ended December 31, 2013 of $0.9 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Revenues increased in 2013 both from the addition of Orbital in April 2013, which contributed approximately $17.5 million of revenues during the last three quarters of 2013 and the growth in the Power and Electromechanical segment of CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan, which had increased revenues over the prior year of approximately $2.1 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in revenues through the Power and Electromechanical segment is associated with growth in revenues through existing customers as well as to new customers, including Future Electronics, which was added as a distribution channel during January 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	The growth in revenues and related gross profits was offset by the continued expenses to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, and GasPT, increased advertising costs for company products, new product introductions, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Orbital as well as the overall growth in expenses of the business in relation to the growth in revenues.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Additionally in 2013, a factor that impacted the cash provided by operations included decreased receivables of approximately $1.6 million associated primarily with CUI Inc. and CUI Japan associated with the timing of deliveries and related sales terms.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $1.7 million increase in inventory, which is primarily a function of product held for scheduled customer orders.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	An increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets largely associated with prepaid license fees for future sales of the GasPT products and prepaid insurance premiums.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	Further, a payment of $1.8 million was issued toward an accrued obligation for services provided to Orbital.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	Unearned revenue and billings in excess of costs increased during the period.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	These are associated with several customer prepayments and deferred revenues including on certain power and electromechanical product sales through distribution.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	During 2013, CUI Global recorded three significant non-cash entries - $0.4 million for derivative expense, $0.8 million for deferred income taxes, and $0.5 million impairment of note receivable.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	As the Company focuses on technology development, product line additions, integrating CUI Canada operations, and developing Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. during 2016, it will continue to fund research and development together with related sales and marketing efforts for its various product offerings with cash on hand and short term investments held to maturity.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	During the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, CUI Global invested $5.1 million, $0.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in fixed assets.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	The 2013 investments in property and equipment included the down payment toward the September 2013 acquisition of the headquarters facility in Tualatin, Oregon, which is discussed below in Investing Activities related party activity .
1108967_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2016 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	CUI Global invested $0.2 million, $0.2 million, and $0.8 million in other intangible assets during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	These investments typically include product certifications, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	In 2013, $0.4 million of the investments are related to the July 2013 acquisition of the exclusive worldwide intellectual property license to the VE probe technology, including both pipeline sampling and thermowell applications.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Revenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, and the addition in March 2015 of CUI Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The customer orders related to the power and electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, the addition of a third distribution channel, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI Canada.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	The Company intends to grow this product line to become a major portion of Orbital s revenue going forward.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	CUI, Inc. introduced 838 new products during the year ended 2015 compared to 937 new products during the year ended 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI s sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The increase in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013 was attributable to the full year operations of Orbital, which was acquired in April 2013 (Energy segment) and accounted for approximately $9.5 million of the sales increase resulting from sales improvement during the second through fourth quarter periods and owning Orbital for the first quarter of 2014, in addition to increases through the Power and Electromechanical segment of approximately $5.9 million, which was the result of continued product introductions, sales and marketing efforts, further expansion through the distribution sales channel, and the increased back log of CUI orders on hand at December 31, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment (CUI, Inc. and CUI Japan) were associated with continued product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, continued growth within the distribution network of CUI products, and the strengthening within the electronic components industry.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	This decrease is reasonable given the overall growth within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	At December 31, 2014, Orbital held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $15.9 million as of December 31, 2014 compared to approximately $25.0 million as of December 31, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	The decrease in Orbital backlog was associated with several items, including the increase of approximately $3.3 million for the third and fourth quarter revenues of 2014 in comparison to 2013, and approximately $1.0 million decrease related to the changes in the Sterling Pound versus US Dollar exchange rate.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P76_S4	Additionally, Orbital was still being affected by the restructuring of the UK operations of its largest customer related to the Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs (RIIO) program and other transformation related initiatives, which significantly impacted that customer s ability to place large contract orders.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	CUI, Inc. introduced 937 new products during the year ended 2014 compared to 808 new products during the year ended 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	The increase to costs of revenue in the Power and Electromechanical Segment during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily the result of the increase in sales.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The decrease in the Energy Segment was due to a better product mix in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects that had increased costs during 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.7% compared to 62.5% for 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	The consolidated cost of revenues was consistent as a percent of revenues due to offsetting factors.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	The Power and Electromechanical segment had higher costs as a percent of revenues in 2015 due to higher costs as we transitioned manufacturing to our new Canada plant while the Energy segment had lower costs as a percent of revenues due to the improved product mix and cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The significant increase to costs of revenue during 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily the result of the increase in sales in both the Power and Electromechanical Segment and the Energy Segment, which included the operations of Orbital during all of 2014 compared to three quarters of 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.5% for 2014 compared to 61.2% in 2013.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	For year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, SG A expenses increased $7.1 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The increase during 2015 is primarily associated with the addition of the SG A activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in Houston, Texas in January 2015 and accounted for approximately $4.0 million of additional SG A. Partially offsetting this increase in the Energy segment expense was a $0.7 million charge during the third quarter of 2014 of equity compensation expense for strategic consulting services that did not recur in 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	In addition, the operations related to CUI Canada, which was acquired in March 2015, accounted for approximately $1.1 million of the increase in SG A during the period.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	The remaining increases in SG A are associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote our product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	As a percentage of total revenue, SG A increased during 2015 to 38% from 34% during the prior-year comparable period due primarily to the additional costs related to the new operations in Houston and Canada.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company anticipates the amount of our sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will further increase in 2016 as the Company continues to grow and as we expand our Energy Segment operations.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The following are additional factors regarding the anticipated increase in SG A expenditures for 2016:
1108967_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	increased costs as we seek to continue to further our technology offerings.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	SG A expenses increased to approximately $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $19.5 million for the same period during 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The 2014 increase of approximately $6.5 million from 2013 is primarily the result of having Orbital included for the first quarter of 2014 SG A activities of Orbital, which accounted for approximately $2.0 million of the increase, stock compensation expense of $1.7 million representing an increase of $1.1 million from 2013 related to stock issuances and vesting expense of options related to consultants for strategic services including customer marketing and investor relations, to directors and employees for services, as well as the overall increase in operations throughout the organization associated with increased revenues of approximately $15.4 million including continued investment in reaching new customers and markets and continuing existing customer relationships.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	The total dollar amount of SG A as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended December 2014 was 34%, compared to 32% in 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	The depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Depreciation and amortization has decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital Gas Systems Limited was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The large increase in the depreciation and amortization expense between 2014 and 2013 is primarily the result of the increased amortization expense of $0.9 million associated with the identifiable intangible assets that were acquired during the second quarter of 2013 with Orbital and amortized over their estimated useful lives, as well as a full year of depreciation expense for tangible depreciating fixed assets at Orbital in 2014 and a full year of depreciation in 2014 of the CUI Global headquarters building acquired in September 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE technologies.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company expects that 2016 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2015 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P90_S6	There were approximately $4 thousand, $32 thousand, and $0 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Bad debt expenses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 represents less than % of total revenues and relates to miscellaneous receivables, which the Company has either recorded an allowance for doubtful collections of the receivable or for which the Company has determined the balance to be uncollectible.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The impairment on note receivable during 2013 is related to fully reserving against the July 1, 2011 note receivable from Comex Electronics and its owners following notification that the primary owner had passed away in December 2013 and the Company intended to seek bankruptcy protection under Japanese law.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	As of December 31, 2015 recovery is unlikely and the full balance has been written off.

1108967_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company recorded expenses of approximately $0 thousand, $0, and $43 thousand during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for non-cash interest expenses, including amortization of debt offering costs.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	The decrease in this expense during 2014 is primarily associated with the completion in 2013 of the amortization of the debt offering costs associated with Wells Fargo related debts.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Company incurred $0.4 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million of interest expense during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	Interest expense is for interest on the secured and unsecured convertible notes, secured and unsecured promissory notes, and bank working capital loans and term loans.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	The decrease in 2015 is due primarily to interest capitalized as part of the construction of the manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the U.K. for Orbital.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	The increases in 2014 is the result of the full years interest related to the promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. for the financing of the purchase of the headquarters facility in Oregon in September 2013, which is discussed further in Item 2.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	A net benefit of $0.4 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting in an effective tax rate of 6.4% for the year.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.7 million and 20.6%, respectively for the same period in 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	The income tax benefit in 2015 and 2014 relates primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	We continue to record a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as it is not more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we have federal and state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $49.1 million, $49.3 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, and for which the Federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2018 and 2035.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	A net benefit of $0.7 million was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.6% for the year.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our income tax benefit and effective tax rate were $0.4 million and 29.7%, respectively for the same period in 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The income tax benefit in 2014 and 2013 related primarily to our foreign operations partially offset by state minimum taxes as all other USA tax benefits are reduced by a full valuation allowance.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	The Company had a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	The consolidated net loss for 2015 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the opening of the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. facility in January 2015 and the addition of CUI Canada, Inc. in March 2015 as well as the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital Gas Systems Limited acquisition and CUI Canada acquisition.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company had a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	The loss in 2014 was largely attributable to several significant non-cash items that impacted profitability.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	A significant portion of the increase in non-cash related expense is the equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	Additionally, with the full year amortization in 2014 of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S4	At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million, while the gross profit margin decreased slightly to 37.5% from 38.8%, which helped to offset these increased costs.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S5	Of this increase, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P102_S6	The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	The loss in 2013 is largely attributable to the non-cash amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired with the April 2013 acquisition of Orbital.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	Total amortization of intangible assets during 2013 was approximately $2.7 million.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	Additionally, the Company recognized bad debt expense of $0.2 million for miscellaneous customer receivables for which collection was uncertain and $0.5 million for the impairment of note receivable relative to the remaining balance of the note receivable for the divestment of CUI Global s 49% interest in Comex in 2011.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Information on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The following sections provide quantitative information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company conducts operations in four principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., U.K. Canadian and Japanese operations, respectively.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Cash is managed centrally within each of the four regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Revenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, the U.S., U.K., Canada and Japan.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013:
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	1 On April 18, 2013, we closed on our share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Limited, which was effective April 1, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	2 On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Tectrol, Inc. (CUI Canada) which was effective March 1, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The Company believes, that during fiscal ended December 31, 2015, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia , provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Our Investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compiles a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are diversified and maintained with several financial institutions.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
1108967_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The Company has trade receivable and revenues concentrations with large customers, which include a large concentration of trade receivables and revenues in the United Kingdom.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our audit excluded an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of CUI-Canada, Inc., which was established in connection with the acquisition of the assets, certain liabilities, and operations of Tectrol, Inc. by CUI Global, Inc. in 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our report dated March 14, 2016 expressed an adverse opinion due to material weaknesses regarding management s failure to design and maintain controls surrounding: 1) the recognition of revenue on a percentage of completion basis under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America; and 2) the preparation and review of foreign income taxes within the Company s consolidated income tax provision.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P4_S3	These weaknesses are described in management s assessment, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P8_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	March 31, 2014, except for Notes 4, 6 and 15 as to which the date is May 13, 2014 and Note 15 which the date is March 16, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION:
1108967_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:
1108967_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	CUI Global Inc. (CUI Global) is a platform company composed of two segments, Power and Electromechanical segment and the Energy segment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment is made up of the following wholly owned subsidiaries of CUI Global: CUI, Inc. (CUI), based in Tualatin, Oregon; CUI Japan, based in Tokyo, Japan; and CUI Canada, based in Toronto, Canada.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	All three subsidiaries are providers of electromechanical components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment defines its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions , which includes Novum.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company s Energy segment is made up of the Orbital Gas Systems Limited subsidiary (Orbital) and the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	This business segment was formed when in April 2013, CUI Global acquired 100% of the capital stock of Orbital, a United Kingdom-based provider of natural gas infrastructure and advanced technology, including metering, odorization, remote telemetry units ( RTU ) and a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	In January 2015, CUI Global formed and opened Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P16_S3	a wholly owned subsidiary, to represent the Energy segment in the North American market.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P16_S4	The GasPT technology products are sold through Orbital.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, total revenues at CUI Global consisted of 67% from the Power and Electromechanical segment and 33% from the Energy segment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P18_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements for 2015 and 2014 include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, CUI Canada (included since March 1, 2015), CUI Properties, LLC, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (included since April 1, 2013), and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (included since January 1, 2015) hereafter referred to as the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
1108967_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Level 1 Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted for similar assets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Level 2 includes assets or liabilities valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities; that is, the inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, billings in excess of costs, unearned revenue, and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Mortgage debt and related notes payable approximate fair value based on current market conditions.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company measures its derivative liability on a recurring basis using significant observable inputs (Level 2).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company s derivative liability is valued using a LIBOR swap curve.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $0.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P26_S5	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company held $0.2 million and $64 thousand, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $2.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.3 million and zero, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company considers all marketable investments with original maturities over 90 days that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date to be short-term investments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Short-term investments primarily include money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes, and commercial paper.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	Under this method, dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, CUI Global had $0 and $11.2 million, respectively, of short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity, which are reported at amortized cost, which approximates market.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $0 and $6.8 million, respectively of investments in certificates of deposit, which were covered under FDIC insured limits and covered under $500,000 of SIPC insured programs for investments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing an 11.54% interest from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013, 8.62% through December 31, 2013, 8.94% through March 31, 2014, and 8.5% thereafter) in Test Products International, Inc. ( TPI ).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	TPI is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Through September 30, 2015, the investment in TPI was treated under the equity method, whereby investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Company s proportionate share, based on present ownership interests of: (a) the investee s profit or loss after the date of acquisition; (b) changes in the Company s equity that have not been recognized in the investee s profit or loss; and (c) certain other adjustments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Through September 30, 2015 CUI Global enjoyed a close association with TPI through common related parties, IED, Inc. and James McKenzie as well as through participation that allowed for a significant amount of influence over TPI s business decisions.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Accordingly, through September 30, 2015, for financial statement purposes, the Company recognized its investment in TPI under the equity method.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Subsequent to September 30, 2015, CUI Global and its common related parties have been unable to obtain a timely financial report, which is inconsistent with prior periods, evidencing a reduction in the influence of CUI Global and the common related parties over TPI.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Based on this change in influence, and CUI Global s level of technical control through its 8.5% equity interest, management has determined that effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that CUI Global no longer has significant influence over TPI and accordingly, the investment in TPI should be accounted for under the cost method.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of CUI Global s cost method investment in TPI is $385 thousand.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	CUI Global reviewed this cost method investment for impairment as of December 31, 2015 and concluded that no impairment was necessary.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of the CUI, Inc. foreign customer receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Inventories consist of finished and un-finished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market through either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention or through the moving average cost method.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	The estimated useful lives for land, buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, and equipment are as follows:
1108967_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	When furniture, vehicles and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Long-lived assets including finite-lived identifiable assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long -lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P51_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third party experts.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The following are the estimated useful life for the intangible assets:

1108967_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	(4) Other intangible assets are amortized over an appropriate useful life, as determined by management in relation to the other intangible asset characteristics.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	(5) Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and when circumstances suggest.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company estimates the patents it has filed have a future beneficial value; therefore it capitalizes the costs associated with filing for its patents.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	At the time the patent is approved, the patent costs associated with the patent are amortized over the useful life of the patent.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	If the patent is not approved, at that time the costs will be expensed.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accrued expenses are liabilities that reflect expenses on the statement of operations that have not been paid or recorded in accounts payable at the end of the period.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period calculated using the treasury stock method.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P93_S2	Due to the Company s net loss in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method would have had an antidilutive effect and therefore all options for the three years were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for each of the three years.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P93_S3	Accordingly, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P93_S4	The weighted average shares outstanding included 61,548 and 1,302 of shares that are considered outstanding, but unissued as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for shares to be issued in accordance with a royalty agreement pertaining to sales of the GasPT devices in 2015 and 2014, unpaid equity share bonuses and unpaid director compensation in 2015.

1108967_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities (with the exception of short-term leases) on the balance sheet.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	The new guidance will be effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within that fiscal year.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard in 2019.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated financial statements instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17 in 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	In accordance with ASU 2015-17, the Company s balance sheet at December 31, 2014 required no reclassification as all deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S3	The standard was originally effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional note disclosures).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S4	On July 9, 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S5	Early application is permitted, but not before the original effective date for public entities, annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P113_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard in 2017.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12 ).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S3	The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S4	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S5	If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S6	The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S7	The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S8	The standard is effective for annual periods and interim period within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P114_S9	The adoption of this provision is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) - Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P115_S3	The adoption of this provision is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ) that requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	The guidance must be applied on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements and we have not elected to early adopt.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company s fair value hierarchy for its cash equivalents, marketable securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, was as follows (in thousands):
1108967_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	There were no transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 in 2015 as determined at the end of the reporting period.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The contingent consideration liability is associated with the acquisition of Tectrol in March 2015 and represents the present value of the expected future contingent payment based on revenue projections of select Tectrol legacy products.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	The inputs used to measure contingent consideration are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	The valuation is not supported by market criteria and reflects the Company s internal revenue forecasts.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P121_S2	Since the valuation is not supported by market criteria, the valuation is completely dependent on unobservable inputs.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	During quarterly updates of the valuation, the calculation of the value is based on actual and reasonably estimated future revenues.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	Based on the Company s fourth quarter 2015 analysis, the Company did not adjust the current value of the contingent consideration based on updated revenue projections.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company s Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P123_S3	That entity entered into a five-year lease of the Toronto facility where Tectrol, Inc. was operating its business.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s).
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which includes the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	At December 31, 2015, $60 thousand of contingent consideration is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and the remainder is included in other long-term liabilities.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S4	The full purchase price less the contingent consideration was paid in cash.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P125_S5	The Company funded the consideration paid to the shareholder of Tectrol with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from short-term investments that had matured.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	The allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

1108967_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	To secure indemnification obligation, 5.0% of the purchase price, or 850,000, was held in escrow through December 1, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	We funded the consideration paid to the shareholder of Orbital with a portion of the net proceeds received from a public offering of our $0.001 par value common stock that was registered on an SEC Form S-1 registration statement declared effective by the SEC on April 11, 2013.
1108967_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	Subsequent to closing on this acquisition, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of CUI Global, Inc.

1108967_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon that evaluation, the Company's management, including the CEO and the CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management of CUI Global, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of such inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( 2013 framework ).
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	After conducting the assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of the material weaknesses described below.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The Company had previously implemented a control at our subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems Limited, in the fourth quarter of 2014 that was designed to ensure all contracts outside of standard terms and conditions were being reviewed by qualified personnel for proper revenue recognition treatment under US GAAP, however, contracts prior to the implementation were not covered by this control.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Accordingly we concluded that this represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P7_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, Management implemented controls to remediate this material weakness; however, the design and operating effectiveness of the controls were determined to be deficient.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company s extensive use of spreadsheets to track job orders that were accounted for under percentage-of-completion became cumbersome and more error prone due to the growth in the number of jobs in the Energy Segment.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	During the audit of the Company s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, a number of errors were identified in the calculation of revenue under the percentage of completion method.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P9_S1	These errors were the result of insufficient detailed management review and lack of process controls and training for the individuals entering the contract details into the spreadsheets as to the proper accounting for the percentage of completion revenue recognition method.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Therefore, we have determined that the combined control deficiencies as described above constitute a material weakness over our revenue recognized on a percentage of completion basis.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	During the year-end audit of our financial statements, it was determined that our provision for foreign income taxes was understated due to calculation errors.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P11_S1	We have concluded that this understatement was a result of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of certain controls surrounding the calculation of our foreign income tax provision.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	The principal factors contributing to the material weakness related to our foreign tax provision process are 1) ineffective review and approval practices relating to taxes, and 2) inadequate controls over the preparation of the quarterly tax provision.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the years presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P14_S0	As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of CUI-Canada, Inc., which is the subsidiary corporation that was set up to hold the assets and certain liabilities acquired on March 5, 2015 from Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P14_S1	CUI-Canada, Inc. is included in our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements and constitutes 5.6% of the Company s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2015 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P15_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, has been audited by Perkins Company, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm who also has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1108967_16_ITEM9A_P16_S0	In response to the material weaknesses described above, our management, with the oversight from our Audit Committee of the board of directors, plans to take measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P16_S1	We will take the following actions to improve the design of our internal control in order to remediate these weaknesses:
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P17_S0	Review, expand, and enhance documentation of the current processes related to percentage of completion accounting and the foreign tax provision process.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P18_S0	Design, document, and implement additional control procedures related to the review of the foreign tax provision and the calculation of percentage of completion accounting for job orders, including controls over the use of spreadsheets.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P19_S0	Provide additional professional education to key personnel involved in revenue recognition.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P20_S0	Engage with a third party foreign tax expert to assist in tax provision preparation and review.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P21_S0	Test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the control procedures.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P22_S0	Conclude on the effectiveness of the remediation plan.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P23_S0	We believe these actions will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P23_S1	As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plan above.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P23_S2	Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P24_S0	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P25_S0	We have audited CUI Global Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P25_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P25_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P26_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P26_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P26_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P26_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P26_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P27_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P27_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P28_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P28_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P29_S0	As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded CUI-Canada, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, because CUI-Canada, Inc. was established in connection with the acquisition of the assets, certain liabilities, and operations of Tectrol, Inc. by CUI Global, Inc. during 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P29_S1	We have also excluded an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of CUI-Canada, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P30_S0	CUI-Canada, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CUI Global, Inc. whose total assets represent 5.6% of consolidated assets included in the consolidated financial statement of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P31_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P32_S0	As more fully described in management s assessment, material weaknesses were identified regarding management s failure to design and maintain controls surrounding: (1) the recognition of revenue on a percentage of completion basis under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America; and (2) the preparation and review of foreign income taxes within the Company s consolidated income tax provision.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P32_S1	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2015 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 14, 2016 on those consolidated financial statements.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P33_S0	In our opinion, CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P34_S0	We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the company after the date of management s assessment.
1108967_16_ITEM9A_P35_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and our report dated March 14, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1108967_16_ITEM10_P42_S0	The board of directors and its committees have an important role in the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment process.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P42_S1	The board regularly reviews with management the Company s financial and business strategies, which include a discussion of relevant material risks as appropriate.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P42_S2	The board discusses with the Company s outside general counsel, as appropriate, its risk oversight and assessment as well as any material risks to the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P42_S3	In addition, the board delegates risk management responsibilities to the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, which committees are each all comprised of independent directors.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P43_S0	The Audit Committee, as part of its charter, oversees the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment of the Company and oversees and assesses the risks associated with the corporate governance and ethics of the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P43_S1	Risk considerations are a material aspect of the Compensation Committee.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P44_S0	The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to executive compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P44_S1	In addition, the Compensation Committee also, as appropriate, assesses the risks relating to the Company s overall compensation programs.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P44_S2	While the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee oversee the management of the risk areas identified above, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P44_S3	This enables the board and its committees to coordinate the risk management, assessment and oversight roles.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P45_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines to establish a framework within which it will conduct its business and to guide management in its running of your Company.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P45_S1	The governance guidelines can be found on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com and are summarized below.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P46_S0	It is important that our board of directors and its committees are performing effectively and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P46_S1	The board of directors and each committee are responsible for annually assessing their effectiveness in fulfilling their obligations.

1108967_16_ITEM10_P63_S3	In general, when the board determines that expansion of the board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the board and management, consultation with the candidate's associates and through other means, a candidate's honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.

1108967_16_ITEM10_P88_S0	Our Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P89_S0	None of the members of the Company s Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the last completed fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P89_S1	None of the Company s executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on the Company s board of directors or Compensation Committee during the last completed fiscal year.
1108967_16_ITEM10_P90_S0	We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the proxy statement on Schedule 14A for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P0_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P0_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P0_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P1_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P1_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P2_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P2_S1	Long-term incentive equity awards are granted in restricted stock or stock options.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P2_S2	These awards generally vest over a two to four-year period.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P2_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long-term strategic goals.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P3_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P3_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P4_S0	Management s Role in the Compensation Setting Process.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P5_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P5_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_16_ITEM11_P6_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P7_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on Company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the board of directors, for the board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the board of directors.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P8_S0	To evaluate our total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available to us.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P8_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at or near the compensation of peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P8_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at that of peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P9_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management annually to the board of directors.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P9_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving the same.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P10_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P10_S2	In 2014, these non-financial performance goals and objectives included the continued integration of Orbital; identification and signing of third party sales representative agencies to support the expansion within the global natural gas market, continued expansion of sales through the distribution channel for CUI, Inc. products; continued product development and new product introductions; and general and administrative expense management.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P10_S3	In addition, such factors as revenue growth and new product adoption were and are considered in setting compensation levels.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual Company performance relative to the targets set as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salaries levels for the coming year.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally following the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the board of directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive and for the executive s base salary levels.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P11_S2	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the board of directors.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P12_S0	As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, under t he Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, t he Compensation Committee considers the prior year shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as appropriate for making compensation decisions.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P12_S1	At the annual meeting of shareholders held December 8, 2015, more than 98% percent of the shareholders present and voting on the proposal approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation disclosed in the Company s proxy statement for the meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 4, 2015.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P12_S2	As a result, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company's shareholders were supportive of the Company's executive compensation philosophy, policies and programs and the Compensation Committee will continue to reach out to shareholders regarding compensation matters.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P12_S3	The Compensation Committee determined to continue such philosophy, policies and programs, with such updates and modifications as appropriate for changing circumstances.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P13_S0	Additional equity-based awards may be also granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, for promotions or special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P14_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P15_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and paid out over a future period in the form of restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P16_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P17_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends therefrom.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P18_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P18_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P19_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P19_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: (i) the Company s EBIDTA; (ii) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and (iii) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_16_ITEM11_P20_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.

1108967_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	In connection with the annual report of CUI Global, Inc. (the Company ), on Form 10-K of the year ended December 31, 2015, I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to the best of my knowledge:
1108967_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The information contained in the annual report fairly presents, in all materials respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries, (collectively, CUI Global or The Company ) is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	CUI Global, Inc.'s principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Company is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	The Company's operations fall into two reportable segments: Power and Electromechanical segment and Energy segment.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	In addition, the Company s corporate overhead activities are included in an other category.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company has subsidiaries in 4 countries, including the United States.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	CUI, Inc., is based in Tualatin, Oregon, CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan and CUI-Canada, acquired in March 2015, is based in Toronto, Canada (collectively referred to as CUI ).
1108967_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	These three subsidiaries are providers of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment aggregates its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our current power line consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc .
1108967_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	CUI, Inc. entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One s Digital Power Technology patents.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The license provides access to Power-One s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into the company s line of digital point of load power modules.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The company, through its power division, also manufactures a wide range of embedded and external power electronics devices for OEM manufacturers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	With the rapid rise in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, CUI is well positioned with our advanced power portfolio to address these quickly-growing markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	System complexity, energy efficiency regulations and the need for more processing power in smaller spaces has moved digital power to a mandatory technology in datacom, server and storage applications.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	As one of the early adopters of digital power, CUI continues to be an industry leader in this space.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	As a founding member of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) Group power consortium partnered with Ericsson Power Modules and Murata, CUI is driving change in the industry to ensure supply chain security and push technology innovation for tomorrow s applications.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P10_S4	The acquisition of certain assets and certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc. (now CUI-Canada) in 2015 now allows us to address the front-end power requirements of these same systems, providing a complete power solution for our customers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	In an environment where OEMs are working to reduce their approved vendor list, the capability to deliver a full system solution is becoming critical.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2014, CUI, Ericsson Power Modules and Murata announced the formation of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) consortium.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The goal of the AMP alliance is to realize the most technically advanced, end-to-end solutions and provide a complete ecosystem of hardware, software and support.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Beyond purely mechanical specifications, it is the standardization of monitoring, control and communications functions, and the creation of common configuration files for plug-and-play interoperability that will ensure compatibility between each firms products.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	The company has an exclusive agreement to develop, sell and distribute the AMT encoder worldwide.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	The AMT series modular encoder is designed with proprietary, capacitive, code-generating technology as opposed to optical or magnetic encoding.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	This unique device allows breakthroughs in selectable resolution, shaft-adaptation and convenient mounting solutions to bring ease of installation, reduction in SKUs and economies of scale in purchasing.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	The AMT amounts to almost 2000 different encoders in one package.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	CUI is selling and distributing the AMT through various customers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Moreover, the product is being marketed by multiple DC motor manufacturers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	The AMT has been awarded several design wins from Motion Control OEM s producing a wide range of products from cash machines to robotics.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	This portfolio of products continues to grow and become more diverse in its ability to meet the needs of the customer base.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We hope to grow our power and electromechanical product line through a planned strategy to increase our name recognition as a technology company.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our plan, already in effect, includes:
1108967_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Developing collaborative relationships with our customers by seeking to meet their design needs in a timely and cost effective manner.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Developing new technologies and expanded manufacturing capabilities as needed.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Growing our global sales and distribution through our international distribution channels.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Directing our marketing efforts through one of our two channels, either directly with the sales representative who understands the targets in the area or through our distributors with partnership marketing.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Attending strategic trade shows to grow our brand presence for our proprietary products.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Because of our growing recognition in innovation, we need to be where the heads of the industries are, particularly at industry trade shows.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P24_S4	This expansion means additional manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas throughout the United States.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Effective April 1, 2013, CUI Global closed on a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. a company organized under the laws of England and Wales ( Orbital-UK ), from its sole shareholder.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	In 2015, the Company started Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Orbital-UK is the largest natural gas systems integrator in the U.K. and has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 30 years.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, Orbital-UK is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to United Kingdom transmission companies, including: Scotia Gas Networks (SGN); Wales West; and National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the U.K. and one of the most respected specialized gas engineering companies in the world.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Energy segment subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Orbital, have developed its portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Its proprietary VE Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT Technology.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	Moreover, VE Technology provides a superior method of penetrating the gas flow without the associated vortex vibration, thereby making it a stand-alone product for thermal sensing (thermowells) and trace-element sampling.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	We deal with a number of independent licensors for whose intellectual property we compete with other manufacturers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees in order to maintain technical rights and exclusivity.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV-GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.)( GL ), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT, is a low cost solution for measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z).
1108967_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi The International Organization of Legal Metrology ( OIML ) for SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	There are instruments like gas chromatographs ( GC ), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Those injection points will continue to use GC s for monitoring.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	On the other hand, there are 2,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P35_S4	All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	In the case of ENGIE and its subsidiaries, negotiations are underway to use the device to update/monitor ENGIE's residential network of some 21 million consumers, calling for the deployment of 10's of thousands of units.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	In addition, there are more than 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPTi Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with significantly cleaner emissions.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	It is this greater efficiency that has led National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, canceling orders for several GC s and, in 2013, replacing those GC s with GasPTi devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	In conjunction with the Orbital acquisition, we have moved the entire GasPT technology portfolio, along with VE Technology, into Orbital s product portfolio.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Orbital has successfully introduced the combined GasPT analyzer and VE sample system (GasPTi) to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	The device is now in the final phase testing at GE's Oil Gas Learning Center in Nuovo Pignone, Florence, Italy.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	In January 2012, the company entered into a five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	SOCRATE is the vendor-of-choice for SNAM RETE GAS ( SRG ).
1108967_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	SOCRATE continues to be involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system concluded 24 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	On September 3, 2015, SRG issued a public tender for the installation of a minimum of 3,300 metering devices to change the way SRG monitors its facilities and assets.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	After a several month bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) pursuant to the tender.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Those 400 units were delivered on-time and in-budget during 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Due to a regulatory issue unrelated to the technology, the next phase of the project has been temporarily delayed; however, SRG has advised Orbital that the project is still fully funded, approved, and expected to move forward as soon as the regulatory matter is resolved.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	SRG has also confirmed that the GasPT device is still the only qualified technology.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Orbital utilizes internationally recognized distribution partners in various global markets in an effort to reach customers throughout the natural gas industry.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	These distribution partners are utilized to supplement and enhance our existing sales and engineering teams in the UK and USA.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	On July 30, 2013, our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe VE sample system, VE thermowell and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	The agreement, which includes certain royalty commitments, gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE sample system, which is able to provide a gas sample from a high pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	The GasPTi system is able to accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Moreover, it provides this analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	VE Technology gives us the ability to control and produce the entire bill of materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Additionally, we can now also manufacture, market and sell additional applications for the VE Technology , including sampling systems separate from the GasPT and Thermowells found throughout all pipeline systems.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	In addition, the VE Technology , in combination with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H 2 0), and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device, VE technology products, and other product offerings.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	For GasPT our strategy has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	This approach has focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	The Company will continue its efforts in those areas.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We will continue the process of identifying prospects for our GasPT technology in the Asian markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Orbital-UK continues to develop new integrated solutions, promote existing technologies, and increase customer relationships within the UK while working to increase its worldwide reach.

1108967_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We rely on third parties to supply components for and to manufacture our products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In order to grow our business to achieve profitability, we will need our manufacturers and suppliers to increase, or scale-up, production and supply by a significant factor over current levels.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	There are technical challenges to scaling-up capacity that may require the investment of substantial additional funds by our manufacturers or suppliers and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary experience.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our manufacturers and suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to grow our business to anticipated levels.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also may represent only a small portion of our supplier s or manufacturer s business, and if they become capacity constrained, they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues depend on key customers and suppliers .

1108967_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Many of our distributors have established relationships with our competitors.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If our distributors choose to place greater emphasis on products and services of their own or those offered by our competitors, our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If our distributors do not effectively market and sell our products, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The loss of one or more of our larger distributors, which may cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our failure to recruit additional distributors or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products or conflicts between distributor sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are a relatively small specialty component and solutions business and face formidable competition .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We define our product offerings into two categories: Power and Electromechanical segment (power supply units) and our Energy segment , which includes the GasPT, VE Technology and IRIS among other energy related products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our international competitors.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in our segments that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business from other companies, many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader product offerings than ours.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We also expect competition to intensify in the future.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, the market for our power and electromechanical components and our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products with evolving industry standards and protocols in a competitive environment.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We continue our process of integrating recent acquisitions into our own business model and we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The areas where we face risks include:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	other as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, a majority of Orbital s revenues for each of its last two fiscal years has come from a few customers.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we fail to continue to do business with Orbital s primary customers at substantially similar or greater levels than recent historical levels, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be significantly harmed.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We will need to grow our organization and we may encounter diff culties in managing this growth .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2016, CUI Global, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 357 full-time employees, which is slightly higher than at December 31, 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations as we follow our growth strategy.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products including the GasPT, VE, IRIS, ICE Block and Novum advanced power products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operating results will vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	the impact of write downs of excess and obsolete inventory.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operating expenses will increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Historically, we limited our investment in operations, but in the future we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase substantially to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are making significant investments in using more professional services and expanding our operations outside the United States.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We intend to make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may determine the need in the future to build a direct sales force to market and sell our products or provide additional resources or cooperative funds to our distributors.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We expect our increased investments to adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long-term benefit.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of distributors, customers and end-users .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in our various markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We expect the brand identity that we have developed through CUI, GasPT, Orbital Gas Systems, IRIS, Novum, and AMT to significantly contribute to the success of our business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of distributors, customers and end-users.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, which we may not do successfully.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The markets for development, distribution and sale of our products are rapidly evolving.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S7	It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	One of our subsidiaries and certain suppliers are in Japan and located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have sales, development and manufacturing resources in Japan.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The risk of earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems, at our location in Japan or a third-party provider could cause interruptions in the products that we provide.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Defects in our products could harm our reputation and business .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our electronic products are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any defects or errors in our products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	harm to our results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	As a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of CUI Global and our subsidiary companies, Orbital, Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, and CUI-Canada as well as the development of our technologies, our business culture and our strategic direction.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Competition for personnel with these skills is intense.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We believe our future success will depend in part on the following:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We license a significant amount of our underlying intellectual property from third parties, i.e., AMT Encoder Technology, Novum Digital Point of Load Technology, ICE Block Technology, GasPT Technology and VE Technology .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P64_S6	Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S4	In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	These claims, whether or not successful, could:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	require us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Even if we have not infringed any third parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If our contract manufacturers do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Because most of our contract manufacturers operate outside the United States, where prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft is more difficult than in the United States, certain of our contract manufacturers, their affiliates, their other customers or their suppliers may attempt to use our intellectual property and trade secrets to manufacture our products for themselves or others without our knowledge.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Although we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The market price for the Company s common stock is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control, which means our market price could be depressed and could impair our ability to raise capital:
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Additionally, because the trading volume of our stock is not large, there can be a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock s true value.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Potential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by our existing line of credit, and may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol CUI.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our shares of common stock are thinly traded.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common shareholders and with the ability to adversely affect shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Although we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred shareholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Preferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P88_S2	This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it diff cult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	As permitted by Colorado law, the Company s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to CUI Global, Inc. or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against a director.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our charter documents and note outstanding to IED, Inc. may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	do not provide for cumulative voting rights.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	CUI Global issued a note to IED, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of CUI, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The note provides that, for so long as any obligations are outstanding under the note, IED will have a right to match any bona fide offer from a third party to acquire CUI, Inc. by any means.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	This matching right could discourage third parties from making an offer to acquire us, which would involve indirectly acquiring CUI, Inc., or from acquiring CUI, Inc. directly, in a transaction our shareholders might find advantageous because any such offer could be matched by IED and result in the third party utilizing time and resources to formulate an offer without being able to complete a transaction.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A significant portion of our total assets at Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. consists of goodwill, which is subject to periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We have goodwill totaling approximately $7.0 million associated with the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We are required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates, at least once a year.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P96_S2	This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P96_S3	These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms .
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	A portion of our revenue arises from our international operations and we anticipate that, as we grow, our revenues from international operations will increase.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in foreign currencies.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P98_S4	The Company does not currently undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The United Kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held in the United Kingdom to determine whether the country should remain a member of the European Union, with voters approving to withdraw from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit).
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Following the results of this referendum, the U.K. government is expected to begin discussions with the EU on the terms and conditions of the proposed withdrawal from the EU.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Current uncertainty over whether the U.K. will ultimately leave the EU, as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and EU, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P100_S3	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the U.K. and the EU, which may take years to complete.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P100_S4	Our Orbital operations in the U.K., could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by Brexit.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	During periods of a strengthening dollar, the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P101_S3	Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our customers, who may curtail or postpone near-term capital investments or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these customers.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Our U.K. operations may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the EU.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The U.K. may need to adopt specific legislation and apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	This may impact our overall business opportunities to operate in the EU and U.K. seamlessly.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	These added challenges may impact our customers' overall business, which may impact our volume and revenue.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT sold by Orbital Gas Systems Ltd., has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Several factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations.
1108967_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	During September, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Properties, LLC, signed closing documents on the purchase of our Tualatin, Oregon corporate office real estate located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue in the Tualatin Franklin Business Park.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition to the corporate office, the property also includes the Company s warehouse facility for CUI Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	The purchase price for this acquisition was $5.1 million and was partially funded by a promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $3.7 million plus interest at the rate of 2.0% above LIBOR, payable over ten years.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	In January 2015, the Company entered into a three-year lease for our 13,175 square foot Houston facility.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	In March 2015, as part of the Tectrol (CUI-Canada) acquisition, the Company leased a manufacturing facility in Toronto, Canada.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	In September 2015, Orbital completed the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/ administration/research and development facility on its existing site in the UK to supplement existing office space.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P3_S1	This enhanced onsite facility enabled the Company to not renew its lease on an additional building it was leasing for manufacturing and office space requirements.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	Additionally, CUI Japan has leased space in Tokyo, Japan used as a sales office.
1108967_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company has enough manufacturing and office capacity to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.
1108967_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are not parties in any legal proceedings.

1108967_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	While all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P9_S6	There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and Electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants and a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S.-based website into Japanese.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified an indefinite-lived intangible technology rights asset for which its expected life was reduced and an impairment of $32 thousand was recorded.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, ``Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company s qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the analysis, determined that there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Through these reviews, management concluded that there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	On a periodic basis, we will also perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and in 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P17_S5	No impairment of goodwill was required.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Stock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	With regards to expected volatility, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflect the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	Due to the significant changes to the Company, including the 2013 equity raise, acquisition of Orbital-UK, increased institutional ownership and other such factors that have impacted volatility, the volatility period utilized for 2014 option grant valuations used a historical period to January 1, 2013.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P19_S5	The Company may change its expected volatility factor to include a longer historical period as the Company has remained consistent with regards to the aforementioned factors.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Each of these methods may produce a different result.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Product revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	For one distributor that comprises 19% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	For three other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 10% of revenue, we do not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate price protection reserve and the right of return and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	For production-type contracts meeting the Company s minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts ( ASC 605-35 ).
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as Costs in excess of billings, an asset account, or Billings in excess of costs, a liability account.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Production type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	For product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2016, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	There was a use of cash from operations of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	This was a decrease from the use of cash from operations of approximately $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, and use of cash from operations of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	CUI-Canada's cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems North America continued to use more cash than it produces due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	As the business matures, this operation is expected to contribute cash but not in the short term.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	Orbital U.K.'s cash from operations improved significantly in 2016 compared to its use of cash in operations in 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2016 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	During 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $1.3 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $1.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	During 2016, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.3 million for inventory reserves partially offset by $0.1 million of an unrealized gain on derivative.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	During 2016 and 2015 and 2014, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	For years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a total of $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower stock-based bonuses and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to less stock paid to consultants in 2015 compared to 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Negative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.4 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to negative cash flow from operations of $3.1 million for 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	During 2015, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI-Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximately $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	Accrued expenses increased $1.8 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P36_S6	Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	During 2015, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for provision for bad debt expense offset by $0.5 million of deferred income tax benefit.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The 2014 change in cash used by operations is primarily the result of the increased net loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2.8 million of which significant non-cash items impacted profitability.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	A significant portion of this increased net loss is associated with equity compensation issued in the form of stock and options grants to strategic consultants, employees and directors for performance as well as vesting of granted stock options totaling approximately $1.7 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Additionally, with the full year amortization of the acquisition related intangible assets acquired with Orbital in 2013, the amortization of intangible assets increased $0.9 million while the deferred income taxes benefit decreased $0.1 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	At the same time as these costs increased, the Company increased revenues $15.4 million and increased gross profits $5.0 million, which contributed to covering operating requirements.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	Of this increase in revenues, the Energy segment increased approximately $9.5 million related to having Orbital for the full year in 2014 as well as general sales growth for this segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	The Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues approximately $5.9 million related to continued market penetration through both new and existing customers, including growth within the distribution sales channels.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Further impacting the cash used in operations in 2014 was the significant increase in trade accounts receivables and billings in excess of costs of approximately $3.3 million associated primarily with the increased fourth quarter revenues and the related sales terms on those deliveries.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	During 2014, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $1.3 million to costs in excess of billings associated with progress on the related projects, increased prepaid expenses of $1.0 million associated primarily with prepaid royalties increases of $0.4 million and increased prepaid taxes of $0.4 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Unearned revenue increased $0.5 million associated with the timing of related customer orders and the terms granted.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Billings in excess decreased $2.9 million during the year related to progress on Energy segment projects.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	During 2014, CUI Global recorded two non-cash entries of $0.2 million for the unrealized loss on derivative and $0.7 million deferred income taxes benefit.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	During the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, CUI Global invested $0.8 million, $5.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in fixed assets.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2017 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	CUI Global invested $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million in other intangible assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The increase to investments in 2016 was due to an increase in product certifications and an ongoing ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2017.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company did not invest in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any money from maturities in 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	In 2015, the Company received $11.1 million from maturities of these investments during the year ended December 31, 2015.

1108967_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	These investments included money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Investments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and also setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s).

1108967_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $96.0 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company expects the revenues from its Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments to help cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operation in Houston to continue to need cash support until it can firmly establish itself.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment acquired in 2015 will also continue to be near break even in the short-term.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	If revenues and the funds raised in 2012 and in April 2013 through the sales of equity are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required.

1108967_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information regarding revenue and costs by segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Revenues in 2016 are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Net revenues in 2016 were generally consistent compared to 2015 but would have been more significantly improved except for lower translated Orbital U.K. operations as a result of falling foreign currency rates in the U.K. following the Brexit vote.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	However, the lower rates did not have a significant effect on operating or net income.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	At December 31, 2016, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.1 million compared to approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	In 2016, the Energy segment's Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary completed its first full year of operations and made progress on its goals of self-sustainability with four consecutive quarters of revenue growth.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Company intends to grow this product line to become a major portion of Orbital s revenue going forward.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	CUI, Inc. introduced 968 new products during the year ended 2016 compared to 838 new products during the year ended 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	The continued product expansion and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI s sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Revenues are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, and the addition in March 2015 of CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, the addition of a third distribution channel, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI-Canada.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	At December 31, 2015, Orbital held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.5 million compared to approximately $15.9 million as of December 31, 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	CUI, Inc. introduced 838 new products during the year ended 2015 compared to 937 new products during the year ended 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 63% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to the offsetting factors of improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment, which were offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 5 percentage points from 63% to 58%.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 65% from 63%.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The increase to costs of revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment during 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily the result of the increase in sales.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The decrease in the Energy segment was due to a better product mix in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects that had increased costs during 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	As a percentage of revenues, the cost of revenue remained generally consistent at 62.6% compared to 62.5% for 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	The consolidated cost of revenues was consistent as a percent of revenues due to offsetting factors.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P75_S4	The Power and Electromechanical segment had higher costs as a percent of revenues in 2015 due to higher costs as we transitioned manufacturing to our new Canada plant while the Energy segment had lower costs as a percent of revenues due to the improved product mix and cost reductions associated with bio-methane projects.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) expenses includes such items as wages, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, SG A increased $1.2 million compared to the prior-year comparative period.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Increased audit and accounting fees in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $0.7 million, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG A. Partially offsetting the increased SG A for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.3 million decrease in non-severance-related SG A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	The remaining increases in SG A during the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, ICE Block, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions partially offset by foreign currency translation decreases at Orbital-UK.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	SG A increased to 40% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	For year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, SG A expenses increased $7.1 million.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	The increase during 2015 is primarily associated with the addition of the SG A activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in Houston, Texas in January 2015 and accounted for approximately $4.0 million of additional SG A. Partially offsetting this increase in the Energy segment expense was a $0.7 million charge during the third quarter of 2014 of equity compensation expense for strategic consulting services that did not recur in 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	In addition, the operations related to CUI-Canada, which was acquired in March 2015, accounted for approximately $1.1 million of the increase in SG A during the period.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	The remaining increases in SG A are associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote our product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P78_S4	As a percentage of total revenue, SG A increased during 2015 to 38% from 34% during the prior-year comparable period due primarily to the additional costs related to the new operations in Houston and Canada.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company anticipates the amount of our sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with 2016 levels.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	The above table includes $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively that was included in cost of sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment and less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales in the Energy segment in both 2015 and 2014.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Depreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015 and U.K. assets were depreciated at lower foreign currency rates in 2016 compared to 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2016 and the purchase of CUI-Canada in March 2015, which meant that 2016 had two more months of CUI-Canada depreciation than in 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of Novum Advanced Power technologies including digital POLs, ICE Block, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE technologies.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	The Company expects that 2017 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2016 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P84_S6	There were approximately $0, $4 thousand, and $32 of impairment expenses recorded by the Company in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Bad debt expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 represents less than % of total revenues and relates to miscellaneous receivables, which the Company has either recorded an allowance for doubtful collections of the receivable or for which the Company has determined the balance to be uncollectible.

1108967_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	The Company recorded $19 thousand of interest income from the note in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary.

1108967_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and bank working capital loans.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	The decrease in 2015 is due primarily to interest capitalized as part of the construction of the manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the U.K. for Orbital.
1108967_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	See Note 15, Capitalized Interest, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

1108967_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company conducts operations in four principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., U.K. Canadian and Japanese operations, respectively.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Cash is managed centrally within each of the four regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Revenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, the U.S., U.K., Canada and Japan.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	(1) On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Tectrol, Inc. (CUI-Canada) which was effective March 1, 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia , provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our Investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compiles a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Cash and cash equivalents are diversified and maintained with several financial institutions.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
1108967_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The Company has trade receivable and revenue concentrations with large customers, which include a large concentration of trade receivables and revenues in the United Kingdom.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), CUI Global Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated March 14, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	CUI Global Inc. (CUI Global) is a platform company composed of two segments, the Power and Electromechanical segment and the Energy segment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment is made up of the wholly owned subsidiaries: CUI, Inc. (CUI), based in Tualatin, Oregon; CUI Japan, based in Tokyo, Japan; and CUI-Canada, based in Toronto, Canada.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	All three subsidiaries are providers of power and electromechanical components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment defines its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions , which includes Novum and ICE Block.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company s Energy segment is made up of the Orbital Gas Systems Ltd subsidiary (Orbital-UK) and the Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary, collectively referred to as Orbital.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	This business segment was formed when in April 2013, CUI Global acquired 100% of the capital stock of Orbital-UK, a United Kingdom-based provider of natural gas infrastructure and advanced technology, including metering, odorization, remote telemetry units ( RTU ) and a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P8_S2	In January 2015, CUI Global formed and opened Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P8_S3	a wholly owned subsidiary, to represent the Energy segment in the North American market.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P8_S4	GasPT and VE technology products are sold through Orbital.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, total revenues at CUI Global consisted of 68% from the Power and Electromechanical segment and 32% from the Energy segment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P10_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, CUI-Canada (included since March 1, 2015), CUI Properties, LLC, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (included since January 1, 2015) hereafter referred to as the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Level 1 Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted for similar assets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Level 2 includes assets or liabilities valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities; that is, the inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company determines when a financial instrument transfers between levels based on management s judgment of the significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the financial instrument.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, billings in excess of costs, unearned revenue, and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	Mortgage debt and related notes payable approximate fair value based on current market conditions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company measures its derivative liability on a recurring basis using significant observable inputs (Level 2).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company s derivative liability is valued using a LIBOR swap curve.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S3	Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S4	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions that were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P19_S5	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Test Products International, Inc. ( TPI ) is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI, Inc., the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing an 8.94% interest from January 1 to March 31, 2014 and 8.5% thereafter).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Through September 30, 2015, CUI Global enjoyed a close association with TPI through common related parties, IED, Inc. and James McKenzie as well as through participation that allowed for a significant amount of influence over TPI s business decisions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	Accordingly, through September 30, 2015, for financial statement purposes, the Company recognized its investment in TPI under the equity method.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Subsequent to September 30, 2015, CUI Global and its common related parties were unable to obtain a timely financial report, which was inconsistent with prior periods, evidencing a reduction in the influence of CUI Global over TPI.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Based on this change in influence, and CUI Global s level of technical control through its 8.5% equity interest, management determined that effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that CUI Global no longer had significant influence over TPI.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Accordingly, the Company's investment in TPI was accounted for under the cost method in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	The Company recorded $19 thousand of interest income from the note for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S5	The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S6	Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P22_S7	CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that no allowance was necessary.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Presented below are the equity method earnings through nine months ended September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 - the periods that CUI Global had significant influence over TPI:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with revenue derived from product sales including present amounts due to contracts accounted for under percentage of completion method.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.2 million and $90 thousand at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is considered adequate.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	The reserve in both periods takes into account aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P24_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of the CUI, Inc. foreign customer receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventories consist of finished and unfinished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market through either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention or through the moving average cost method.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	At December 31, 2016, and 2015, inventory is presented on the balance sheet net of reserves.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company provides reserves for inventories estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company s estimation process for assessing the net realizable value is based upon its known backlog, projected future demand, historical usage and expected market conditions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Manufactured inventory includes material, labor and overhead.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Inventory by category at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	(1) At December 31, 2015, CUI-Canada inventory reserves of $97 thousand were reclassified from raw materials to inventory reserves and $246 thousand of prepaid expenses at CUI Inc. were reclassified to raw materials inventory.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Activity in inventory reserves for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Land is recorded at cost and includes expenditures made to ready it for use.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Land is considered to have an infinite useful life.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Buildings and improvements are recorded at cost.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Furniture, vehicles, and equipment are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term, estimated useful life, or ten years.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The cost of buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The estimated useful lives for buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, and equipment are as follows:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	When furniture, vehicles and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Long-lived assets including finite-lived identifiable assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long -lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P42_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third party experts.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The following are the estimated useful life for the intangible assets:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	(1) Technology rights are amortized over a 20-year life or the term of the rights agreement.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	(2) Software assets are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	(3) Patents are amortized over the life of the patent.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Any patents not approved will be expensed at that time.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	(4) Other intangible assets are amortized over an appropriate useful life, as determined by management in relation to the other intangible asset characteristics.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	(5) Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and when circumstances suggest.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company s qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2016, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of goodwill and a qualitative analysis of its indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2016, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	CUI Global has adopted ASU 2011-08, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The ASU allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	Under this ASU, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	We adopted ASU 2011-08 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.

1108967_17_ITEM8_P105_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P105_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	This update was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S3	This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2017.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S4	This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P106_S5	We have not yet selected a transition date nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	In February 2016, The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities (with the exception of short-term leases) on the balance sheet.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	The new guidance will be effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within that fiscal year.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P107_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard in 2019.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ) that requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P109_S2	The guidance must be applied on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P109_S3	The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements and we have not elected to early adopt.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S3	The standard was originally effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional note disclosures).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S4	On July 9, 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S5	Early application is permitted, but not before the original effective date for public entities, annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of the Company s pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S7	After initial evaluation, the Company expects to implement using the full retrospective method.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P110_S8	The Company plans to finalize the new methodology in the second quarter of 2017 in preparation for implementation in the first quarter of 2018.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company expects to utilize certain practical expedients in its implementation of the revenue standard.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company s fair value hierarchy for its cash equivalents, marketable securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, was as follows:
1108967_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	There were no transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 in 2016 as determined at the end of the reporting period.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The contingent consideration liability is associated with the acquisition of Tectrol in March 2015 and represents the present value of the expected future contingent payment based on revenue projections of select Tectrol legacy products.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	The inputs used to measure contingent consideration are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The valuation is not supported by market criteria and reflects the Company s internal revenue forecasts.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	Since the valuation is not supported by market criteria, the valuation is completely dependent on unobservable inputs.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	During quarterly updates of the valuation, the calculation of the value is based on actual and reasonably estimated future revenues.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	Based on the Company s fourth quarter 2016 analysis, the Company adjusted the current value of the contingent consideration based on updated revenue projections.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company s Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P117_S3	That entity entered into a five-year lease of the Toronto facility where Tectrol, Inc. was operating its business.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s).
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S2	The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which includes the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S3	At December 31, 2016, $61 thousand of contingent consideration is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and $42 thousand is included in other long-term liabilities.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S4	The full purchase price less the contingent consideration was paid in cash.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P119_S5	The Company funded the consideration paid to the shareholder of Tectrol with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from short-term investments that had matured.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
1108967_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	The allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

1108967_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Management reviews the goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest.

1108967_17_ITEM10_P35_S1	In that spirit, we have summarized several of our corporate governance practices below.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P36_S0	The board of directors and its committees have an important role in the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment process.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P36_S1	The board regularly reviews with management the Company s financial and business strategies, which include a discussion of relevant material risks as appropriate.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P36_S2	The board discusses with the Company s outside general counsel, as appropriate, its risk oversight and assessment as well as any material risks to the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P36_S3	In addition, the board delegates risk management responsibilities to the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, which committees are each all comprised of independent directors.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P37_S0	The Audit Committee, as part of its charter, oversees the Company s risk oversight, management and assessment of the Company and oversees and assesses the risks associated with the corporate governance and ethics of the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P37_S1	Risk considerations are a material aspect of the Compensation Committee.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P38_S0	The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to executive compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P38_S1	In addition, the Compensation Committee also, as appropriate, assesses the risks relating to the Company s overall compensation programs.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P38_S2	While the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee oversee the management of the risk areas identified above, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P38_S3	This enables the board and its committees to coordinate the risk management, assessment and oversight roles.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P39_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines to establish a framework within which it will conduct its business and to guide management in its running of your Company.

1108967_17_ITEM10_P58_S1	Candidates recommended by stockholders will be evaluated based on the same criteria described above.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P58_S2	Stockholders desiring to suggest a candidate for consideration should send a letter to the Company's secretary and include: (a) a statement that the writer is a shareholder (providing evidence if the person's shares are held in street name) and is proposing a candidate for consideration; (b) the name and contact information for the candidate; (c) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (d) information regarding the candidate's qualifications to be director, including but not limited to an evaluation of the factors discussed above which the board would consider in evaluating a candidate; (e) information regarding any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate; (f) information regarding potential conflicts of interest and (g) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as director if nominated and elected.

1108967_17_ITEM10_P84_S0	Our Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P85_S0	None of the members of the Company s Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the last completed fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P85_S1	None of the Company s executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on the Company s board of directors or Compensation Committee during the last completed fiscal year.
1108967_17_ITEM10_P86_S0	We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the proxy statement on Schedule 14A for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P0_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P0_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P0_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P1_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P1_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P2_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P2_S1	Long-term incentive equity awards are typically granted in restricted stock or stock options.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P2_S2	These awards generally vest over a two to four-year period.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P2_S3	This opportunity for share ownership was provided in order to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long-term strategic goals.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P3_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P3_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P4_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P4_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_17_ITEM11_P5_S0	Assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P6_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non-CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on Company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P6_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the board of directors, for the board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P6_S3	For related party employee matters, appropriate personnel meet with the Compensation Committee to determine compensation and incentives and to review ongoing performance of the employee.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P6_S4	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the board of directors.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P7_S0	To evaluate whether total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P7_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at or near the compensation of peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P7_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at that of peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management annually and as needed to the board of directors.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P8_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving the same.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P9_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P9_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P9_S2	In 2016, these non-financial performance goals and objectives included among other factors, the continued Growth of the Orbital Gas Systems North America operations; continued integration of CUI-Canada; continued expansion within the global natural gas market, expansion of distribution and direct customer relationships through CUI, Inc.; continued product development and new product introductions including the ICE Block and various VE technology-based sample systems; and general and administrative management responsibilities.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P9_S3	In addition, such factors as revenue growth and new product adoption were and are considered in setting compensation levels.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual Company performance relative to the targets set as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salary levels.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally following the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the board of directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P11_S0	Executive base salary levels are reviewed in accordance with their respective employment agreements.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P11_S1	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the board of directors.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P12_S0	As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, under t he Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, t he Compensation Committee considers the prior year shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as appropriate for making compensation decisions.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P12_S1	At the annual meeting of shareholders held November 29, 2016, more than 96% percent of the shareholders present and voting on the proposal approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation disclosed in the Company s proxy statement for the meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2016.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P12_S2	As a result, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company's shareholders were supportive of the Company's executive compensation philosophy, policies and programs and the Compensation Committee will continue to reach out to shareholders regarding compensation matters.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P12_S3	The Compensation Committee determined to continue such philosophy, policies and programs, with such updates and modifications as appropriate for changing circumstances.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P13_S0	Additional equity-based awards may also be granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, promotions, for special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P14_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P15_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by revenues, cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and may be paid out over a future period in the form of stock, restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P16_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P17_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends therefrom.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P17_S1	Also included in the summary are comparative performance numbers, specific milestones, strategic objectives, and other elements used to measure each executive's individual performance.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P18_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P18_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, in order to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P19_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to both the short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P19_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: (i) the Company s earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization (EBIDTA); (ii) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and/or (iii) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P20_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P20_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P20_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management s proposed method of achieving the goal.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P20_S3	These goals change throughout the operational process because of changing dynamics such as economic conditions, current success of marketing, availability of materials, availability of funding and overall momentum toward achieving the goal.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P21_S0	Incentive awards are typically paid out in cash, restricted common stock or option awards.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P21_S1	The incentive award targets for the executives are established at the beginning of the year, generally, as a percentage of their base salary and the actual awards are determined at the following year s annual board of directors meetings based on actual Company performance relative to established goals and objectives, as well as on evaluation of the executive s relevant departmental and individual performance during the past year.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P22_S0	In many instances the award of restricted common stock and stock options vests over a multi-year term in equal periodic tranches.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P22_S1	The award of restricted common stock purchased through options generally, although not in every instance, vests immediately upon exercise of the option and generally has a validity of up to ten years and a per share purchase price of no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P22_S2	The awards are intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P23_S0	Our wholly owned subsidiaries, CUI, Inc. and Orbital Gas Systems North America, maintain a 401(k) plan.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P24_S0	The Company 401(k) retirement savings plan allows employees to contribute to the plan after they have completed 60 days of service and are 18 years of age.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P24_S1	The Company matches the employee s contribution up to 6% of total compensation.
1108967_17_ITEM11_P24_S2	Total employer contributions, net of forfeitures were $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

1108967_17_ITEM11_P25_S2	Orbital made total employer contributions of $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

1108967_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	These areas, however, need forward-looking growth investment to understand the customers needs and develop products accordingly.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are in line with market standards for quality, customer service and pricing.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our plan is to stay with this mark during our anticipated growth.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	We intend to expand according to our existing model.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	This expansion means additional manufacturer representative coverage and outside sales people in strategic areas.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (Orbital-UK) is based in Stone, Staffordshire in the United Kingdom and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (Orbital North America), which initiated operations in 2015, is based in Houston, Texas.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Orbital-UK has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 30 years and is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to United Kingdom transmission companies, including: Scotia Gas Networks (SGN); Wales West; and National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the UK and one of the most respected specialized gas engineering companies in the world.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	Orbital North America leverages the experience of Orbital-UK in an effort to reach the North American market with the innovative solutions that Orbital-UK customers have benefited from for years.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Energy segment subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Orbital, have developed a portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Its proprietary VE Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT Technology.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	VE Technology provides a superior method of penetrating the gas flow without the associated vortex vibration, thereby making it a stand-alone product for thermal sensing (thermowells) and trace-element sampling.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	We deal with several independent licensors for whose intellectual property we compete with other manufacturers.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees to maintain technical rights and exclusivity.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device designed by DNV GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	The GasPT, is a low-cost solution for measuring natural gas quality.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties of the gas, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z).
1108967_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi The International Organization of Legal Metrology ( OIML ) for SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	At present, there is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	There are instruments like gas chromatographs ( GC ) that technically can be considered competition, but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	For example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are ~ 7,000 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, there are more than 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Each turbine is subject to variances in natural gas quality.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPT Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with significantly cleaner emissions.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	Because of the delay in information from the GC s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P34_S4	This greater efficiency has led National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, canceling orders for several GC s and, in 2013, replacing those GC s with GasPT devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Orbital has successfully introduced the combined GasPT analyzer and VE sample system (GasPTi) to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	The device is now in final phase testing at GE s Oil Gas Learning Center in Nuovo Pignone, Florence, Italy.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	In January 2012, the company signed a five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	SOCRATE is a vendor-of-choice for SNAM RETE GAS ( SRG ).
1108967_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	SOCRATE was involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system concluded 24 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	On September 3, 2015, SRG issued a public tender for the installation of at least 3,300 metering devices to change the way SRG monitors its facilities and assets.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	After a several months bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) under the tender.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Those 400 units were delivered on-time and in-budget during 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	A regulatory issue unrelated to the technology delayed the next phase of the project through 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S4	The Company expects the project to resume in 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S5	The customer is currently working with its regulatory body to implement a program that would improve its ability to more rapidly deploy the new metering solutions.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P38_S6	SRG has confirmed that the GasPT device is still the only qualified technology.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	In addition, Orbital has been very involved in developing a method by which bio-methane gas can be injected into the existing natural gas infrastructure without enhancement, thus remaining environmentally-friendly while maintaining a carbon neutral footprint.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Bio-methane gas (produced wherever organic material is decaying) can be, and is a significant source of environmentally-friendly, carbon neutral energy in the U.K. Italy produces as much as 8 billion cubic meters of bio-methane gas per year and could dramatically reduce its carbon footprint by capturing that bio-methane gas in the form of energy.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	The specific advantages of bio-methane as a source of energy is that it uses already-existing pipeline infrastructure to quickly and efficiently deliver energy to the end-user, who, in most cases, is already connected to the grid.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	The problem in the U.K. and elsewhere is maintaining accurate billing after the bio-methane gas is injected into the grid.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	In brief, how billing is currently done in the U.K. (and throughout much of Western Europe) means that to meet critical calorific value ( CV ) levels, before being injected into the grid, bio-methane gas must be enhanced by injecting propane or some other complex carbon material to allow the bio-methane gas to fit the CV envelope of the regional billing model.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Such enhancement means that the very simple, environmentally-friendly bio-methane gas is transformed into a complex carbon gas, which increases its carbon footprint.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	In addition, the energy used by fleets of vehicles transporting propane to the propane injectors at each bio-methane-to-grid facility further increases the carbon footprint and resulting pollution to the environment - All-in-all, a very environmentally-unfriendly, highly polluting method of delivering what would otherwise be a green alternative energy source.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	DNV GL, the well-respected Norwegian consulting firm, has opined that the need to enhance bio-methane gas actually makes such gas less environmentally-friendly than standard natural gas sources.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The question, then, is how to avoid having to enhance bio-methane gas before injecting it into the grid.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The answer, simply, is to measure the quality of the gas for billing downstream from the bio-methane injection sites, so the CV does not affect the billing, which is done in a much closer proximity to the end-user; thereby, becoming much more accurate and reliable.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	A simplified animation of the analysis/issues can be found at a link from our www.CUIGlobal.com website ( Future Billing Methodology Animation) .
1108967_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	To develop such a billing methodology, DNV GL (in conjunction with Orbital) has produced a proof-of-concept proposal.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	The first portion of that proposal, an industry survey, was memorialized in the Future Billing Methodology ( FBM ) Project Consultation Report, which can also be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at our www.CUIGlobal.com website (FBM Project Consultation) .
1108967_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	That consultation resulted in an approval by Ofgem, the U.K. regulatory authority, to move forward with field trials to decarbonize the U.K. energy network.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	A copy of the Stage Gate Report memorializing that Ofgem approval can be found on the DNV GL website, for which a link can be found on our www.CUIGlobal.com website ( FBM Stage Gate Report ).
1108967_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Finally, a comprehensive description of the field trials, including the use of Orbital s proprietary GasPT technology to provide for quick, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective data monitoring, was recently published on January 11, 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	A copy of that report can be found at the DNV GL website, which is linked to at www.CUIGlobal.com ( FBM Project Report ).
1108967_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Orbital has produced an initial, formal bid for the UK project of up to 490,000,000 ($661,000,000 USD at December 31, 2017) over 15 to 20 years.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	DNV GL and Ofgem, the UK regulatory agency, have both confirmed that the formal bid falls within budget guidelines.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Orbital holds exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe, VE sample system, VE thermowell and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	The agreement, which includes certain royalty commitments, gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT natural gas metering systems.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE Technology , which can provide a gas sample from a high-pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	The GasPTi system can accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	It provides this analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	VE Technology gives us the ability to control and produce the entire bill of materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	In addition, the VE Technology , combined with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H20), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Some of the features of the VE Technology that set it apart from its competition are the VE fixed or retractable sampling probe with its patented helical strakes to eliminate vortex shedding and the need for wake calculations and its patented aerodynamic probe tip to actively reject particulate, minimizing the need for filtration and allowing a small bore to optimize sample transit time.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	In addition, the VE sample system provides a simple, optimized system to deliver a representative sample to any analyzer with no dead volume, threaded connections or components in the sample pathway.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Simple concepts and decades of detailed engineering allows very quick and simple customization to suit any application.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device, VE technology products, and other product and integrated solutions.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	For GasPT, our strategy has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	This approach has focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and North America.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	The Company will continue its efforts in those areas.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We will continue identifying prospects for our GasPT technology in the Asian markets.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographic locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Orbital continues to develop new integrated solutions, promote existing technologies, and increase customer relationships.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company will continue to identify opportunities to utilize the unique VE Technology beyond the existing product offering, with a focus on gas sampling, thermowells, and trace element sampling applications.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	We signed an exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	During 2016, Orbital signed a Technology and Patent License Agreement with daily Thermetrics, a globally-respected design and manufacturing company providing process industries with precise temperature measurement instrumentation.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Agreement calls for the manufacture and sale of the patented natural gas sampling VE Technology in North America.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	This relationship is expected to allow Orbital to more efficiently penetrate the North American energy market.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company will continue to seek new opportunities to design, manufacture, and produce innovative solutions within the Energy segment to increase customer reach, product innovation, and growth.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Orbital-UK was awarded the contract by DNV GL, a leader within the oil and gas industry.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	The project is part of DNV GL s Future Billing Methodology ( FBM ) Project, which, when implemented in late-2019, could call for the deployment of literally tens-of-thousands of the Company s proprietary GasPT analyzers.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The objective of the SGN project is to optimize gas network design and network operation assumptions.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	This project will use a pilot trial methodology with the procurement and installation of innovative sensor technologies across pressure tiers in a gas distribution system.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	These technologies, combined with novel power and communications and a cloud-based data system, will be used by DNV GL to develop a prototype real-time energy demand model, a world first.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Innovative technology, such as Orbital s proprietary GasPT Technology, form the backbone of the solution coupled with custom metering designs to be used to meet the project criteria.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P65_S4	The project produces a GasPT application which would allow the millions of residential energy consumers to have immediate, real-time access to the cost of their energy usage.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	We continue negotiations with ENGIE, the French transmission company, for deployment of the devices to both GRTgaz (ENGIE s pipeline subsidiary) and Elengy (ENGIE s liquid natural gas subsidiary) in the near future.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	ENGIE has agreed to represent the technology to other Western European, North American, and Asian entities in a partnership with Orbital.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	According to the latest industry analysts (including MarketsandMarkets ), the global GC market reached $2,583.6 million in 2014 and is poised to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2014 to 2019, reaching $3,605.1 million by 2019.

1108967_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE Technology, competes in a mature industry with established competitors.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low-cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real-time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S3	From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z).
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S4	This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S5	There is no equivalent product competition.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P93_S6	There are instruments like gas chromatographs that are technically competition, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT system.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	In an industry first, CUI has chosen that, in addition to sales commission, many of our sales representative firms will also receive a charity commission to be donated to charities of their choice.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	One of CUI s values is generosity, which includes philanthropic giving.
1108967_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	We give in our local community and we want to also give in the communities in which we do business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties.

1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If we are not able to generate sufficient income and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and growth plans, we may seek additional capital from equity and debt placements or corporate arrangements.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to technologies or products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to raise adequate funds or generate them from operations, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some or all of our growth plans or liquidate some or all of our assets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There is no assurance we will achieve or sustain profitability .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a net loss of $12.6 million.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	There is no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we fail to achieve or sustain profitability, the price of our common stock could fall and our ability to raise additional capital could be adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have expanded our business activities and these activities may not be successful and may divert our resources from our existing business activities .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our historical business was a commoditized power and electromechanical parts distribution business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In recent years, we have focused our business on the acquisition, development and commercialization of new and innovative technologies/products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may not be successful in acquiring technologies that are commercially viable.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may fail to successfully develop or commercialize technologies that we acquire.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Research, development and commercialization of such acquired technologies may disproportionately divert our resources from our other business activities.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If our manufacturers or our suppliers are unable to provide an adequate supply of products, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We rely on third parties to supply components for and to manufacture our products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In order to grow our business to achieve profitability, we will need our manufacturers and suppliers to increase, or scale up, production and supply by a significant factor over current levels.

1108967_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our manufacturers and suppliers are unable to do so, we may not be able to meet the requirements to grow our business to anticipated levels.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also may represent only a small portion of our supplier s or manufacturer s business, and if they become capacity constrained, they may choose to allocate their available resources to other customers that represent a larger portion of their business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international venues and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues depend on key customers and suppliers .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Company s major product lines in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were power and electromechanical products and natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During 2017, over 36% of revenues were derived from two customers, Digi-Key Electronics at 26% and Future Electronics at 10%.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	During 2016, over 19% of revenues were derived from one customer, Digi-Key Electronics.

1108967_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	With the United Kingdom operations of Orbital, the Company also has foreign revenue and trade accounts receivable concentrations in the United Kingdom of 17% and 28%, respectively as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 20% and 27%, respectively as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Additionally, at December 31, 2017 the Company had accounts receivable concentrations of 11% in Canada and at December 31, 2016, the Company had accounts receivable concentrations of 11% in China and 10% in Italy.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue to maintain all of our existing key customers in the future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Should we, for any reason, discontinue our business relationship with any one of these key customers, the impact to our revenue stream would be substantial.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	For additional information on our concentrations, see Note 17 Concentrations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We rely on third-party distributors to generate a substantial part of our revenue and, if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our power and electromechanical component products through distributors and we expect that sales through these distributors will represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our ability to expand our distribution channels depends in part on our ability to educate our distributors about our products, which are complex.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Many of our distributors have established relationships with our competitors.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If our distributors choose to place greater emphasis on products and services of their own or those offered by our competitors, our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If our distributors do not effectively market and sell our products, or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The loss of one or more of our larger distributors, which may cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our failure to recruit additional distributors or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products or conflicts between distributor sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are a relatively small specialty component and solutions business and face formidable competition .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are a relatively small company with limited capitalization in comparison to many of our international competitors in each of our business segments.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Because of our size and capitalization, we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in our segments that is essential to our continued growth and success in all of our markets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business from other companies, many of whom have greater name recognition, more resources and broader product offerings than ours.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We also expect competition to intensify in the future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, the market for our power and electromechanical components and our inferential natural gas monitoring device, the GasPT, is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and shortening product life cycles.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our future success in keeping pace with technological developments and achieving product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or customer expectations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and growth prospects.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our products with evolving industry standards and protocols in a competitive environment.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We continue our process of integrating recent acquisitions into our own business model and we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technologies may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The areas where we face risks include:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	other as yet unknown risks that may impact our business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For example, a majority of Orbital s revenues for each of its last two fiscal years has come from a few customers.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we fail to continue to do business with Orbital s primary customers at substantially similar or greater levels than recent historical levels, our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be significantly harmed.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, or reductions to our tangible net worth any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We will need to grow our organization and we may encounter difficulties in managing this growth .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2017, CUI Global, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 333 full-time employees.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations as we follow our growth strategy.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize new products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operating results will vary over time and such fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because revenues for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any estimates we may provide to the market, the price of our common shares would likely decline substantially.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Factors that could cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate include:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	the impact of write downs of excess and obsolete inventory.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our operating expenses will increase as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business and national stock market reporting and compliance obligations .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Historically, we limited our investment in operations, but in the future, we expect our operations and marketing investments to increase substantially to support our anticipated growth and as a result of our listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are making significant investments in using more professional services and expanding our operations outside the United States.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We intend to make additional investments in personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may determine the need in the future to build a direct sales force to market and sell our products or provide additional resources or cooperative funds to our distributors.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Such changes to our existing sales model would likely result in higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenues.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We expect our increased investments to adversely affect operating income in the short term while providing long-term benefit.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of distributors, customers and end-users .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness in our various markets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We expect the brand identity that we have developed through CUI, GasPT, Orbital Gas Systems, IRIS, ICE, and AMT to significantly contribute to the success of our business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Maintaining and enhancing these brands is critical to expanding our base of distributors, customers and end-users.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products, which we may not do successfully.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The markets for development, distribution and sale of our products are rapidly evolving.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may significantly restrict our ability to generate revenues or obtain debt or equity financing .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty and governments in many countries continue to evaluate and implement spending cuts designed to reduce budget deficits.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These conditions and deficit reduction measures could reduce demand for our products and services, including through reduced government infrastructure projects, which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve our sales targets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which in turn, could make it more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products and services in a timely manner, or to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors and business in general.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	One of our subsidiaries and certain suppliers are in Japan and located in areas subject to natural disasters or other events that could stop us from having our products made or shipped or could result in a substantial delay in our production or development activities .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have sales, development and manufacturing resources in Japan.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The risk of earthquakes, typhoons and other natural disasters in this geographic area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Despite precautions taken by us and our third-party providers, a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems, at our location in Japan or at third-party providers could cause interruptions in the products that we provide.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected contractor(s) to another third-party vendor.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We cannot assure you that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Defects in our products could harm our reputation and business .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our products are complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Defects in our products may lead to product returns and require us to implement design changes or updates.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any defects or errors in our products, or the perception of such defects or errors, could result in:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	harm to our results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We and our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a limited number of suppliers.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design and qualify new components .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely on third-party components and technology to build and operate our products and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Shortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We depend on key personnel and will need to recruit new personnel as our business grows .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	As a small company, our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who are critical to the overall management of CUI Global and our subsidiary companies, Orbital, Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., CUI Inc., CUI Japan, and CUI-Canada as well as the development of our technologies, our business culture and our strategic direction.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies on the lives of these critical individuals.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we are successful in expanding our product and customer base, we will need to add additional key personnel as our business continues to grow.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we cannot attract and retain enough qualified and skilled staff, the growth of the business may be limited.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our ability to provide services to customers and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain staff with professional experiences that are relevant to technology development and other functions the Company performs.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Competition for personnel with these skills is intense.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We may not be able to recruit or retain the caliber of staff required to carry out essential functions at the pace necessary to sustain or expand our business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We believe our future success will depend in part on the following:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and customer service personnel.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our ability to compete effectively or to defend ourselves from litigation could be impaired .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We license a significant amount of our underlying intellectual property from third parties, i.e., AMT Encoder Technology, Novum Digital Point of Load Technology, ICE Technology, GasPT Technology and VE Technology .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The loss of our rights as a licensee under any of these or future technology licensing arrangements, or the exclusivity provisions of these agreements, could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur in the future without our knowledge.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our technology in licensing arrangements or in cross-licensing negotiations and could impair our ability to compete.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P64_S6	Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In the future we may need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology and trade secrets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In order to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our key employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may have difficulty enforcing our rights to our proprietary technology and trade secrets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to determine and enforce the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and our business may be adversely affected .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us or the parties from whom we license our technological rights in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	These claims, whether or not successful, could:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	require us to redesign our products to avoid infringement.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Even if we have not infringed any third parties intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If our contract manufacturers do not respect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Because most of our contract manufacturers operate outside the United States, where prosecution of intellectual property infringement and trade secret theft is more difficult than in the United States, certain of our contract manufacturers, their affiliates, their other customers or their suppliers may attempt to use our intellectual property and trade secrets to manufacture our products for themselves or others without our knowledge.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Although we attempt to enter into agreements with our manufacturers to preclude them from using our intellectual property and trade secrets, we may be unsuccessful in monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Although we take steps to stop counterfeits, we may not be successful and customers who purchase these counterfeit goods may have a bad experience and our brand may be harmed.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If such an impermissible use of our intellectual property or trade secrets were to occur, our ability to sell our products at competitive prices and to be the sole provider of our products may be adversely affected and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The market price for the Company s common stock is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control, which means our market price could be depressed and could impair our ability to raise capital:
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Additionally, because the trading volume of our stock is not large, there can be a disparity between the bid and the asked price that may not be indicative of the stock s true value.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Potential purchasers should not expect to receive a return on their investment in the form of dividends on our common stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted by the terms of any of our future debt or preferred securities.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase shares of our stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There is a limited public trading market for our common stock so you may not be able to resell your stock and may not be able to turn your investment into cash .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol CUI.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our shares of common stock are thinly traded.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Due to the illiquidity, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Because our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common shareholders and with the ability to adversely affect shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Although we do not have any preferred stock outstanding presently, our Articles of Incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, as well as the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred shareholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Preferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred shares may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our Articles of Incorporation limits director liability, thereby making it difficult to bring any action against them for breach of fiduciary duty .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	As permitted by Colorado law, the Company s Articles of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to CUI Global, Inc. or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty, with certain exceptions.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against a director.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our charter documents and note outstanding to IED, Inc. may inhibit a takeover that shareholders consider favorable .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the Company, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	do not provide for cumulative voting rights.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	CUI Global issued a note to IED, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of CUI Inc.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The note provides that, for so long as any obligations are outstanding under the note, IED will have a right to match any bona fide offer from a third party to acquire CUI Inc. by any means.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P94_S2	This matching right could discourage third parties from making an offer to acquire us, which would involve indirectly acquiring CUI Inc., or from acquiring CUI Inc. directly, in a transaction our shareholders might find advantageous because any such offer could be matched by IED and result in the third party utilizing time and resources to formulate an offer without being able to complete a transaction.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A significant portion of our total assets at Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. consists of goodwill, which is subject to periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we have goodwill totaling approximately $4.6 million associated with the acquisition of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd and CUI-Canada.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We are required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates, at least once a year.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	This estimated fair value could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P96_S3	These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P96_S4	See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Indefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets for more information on the Company s goodwill impairment testing and the $3.2 million impairment taken against goodwill in 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect our operating results in U.S. dollar terms .
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	A portion of our revenue arises from our international operations and we anticipate that, as we grow, our revenues from international operations will increase.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international operations are often denominated in foreign currencies.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	As a result, our consolidated U.S. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as revenues and expenses of our international operations are translated from local currencies into U.S. dollars.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P98_S4	The Company does not currently undertake any hedges to protect against adverse foreign currency exposure.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The United Kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held in the United Kingdom to determine whether the country should remain a member of the European Union, with voters approving to withdraw from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit).
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P100_S1	The UK is currently scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Following the referendum, the UK government began discussions with the EU on the terms and conditions of the withdrawal from the EU and on terms of a transition period to December 31, 2020 proposed by the EU but not yet agreed upon.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Current uncertainty over the final outcome of the negotiations between the UK and EU, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P101_S2	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the terms negotiated between the UK and the EU, which may take years to complete.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our Orbital operations in the UK could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by Brexit.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term and a strong U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P103_S2	During periods of a strengthening dollar, the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our customers, who may curtail or postpone near-term capital investments or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these customers.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our UK operations may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the EU.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The UK may need to adopt specific legislation and apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate EU member states.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	This may impact our overall business opportunities to operate in the EU and UK seamlessly.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P105_S2	These added challenges may impact our customers overall business, which may impact our volume and revenue.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our gas quality inferential measurement device, GasPT , has not gained market acceptance as rapidly as we anticipated.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our future financial performance and ability to commercialize the GasPT device and compete successfully will depend on our ability to effectively manage acceptance and introduction of our GasPT device in the natural gas quality inferential measurement device market.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Although we have entered into agreements and letters of understanding with third parties, which could result in substantial sales of the GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance we will sell at or near the number of units forecasted under these contracts.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Several factors have and may continue to contribute to the slower than anticipated market acceptance of the GasPT device, such as: disruptive technologies, such as the GasPT device, are slow to be accepted in a mature industry, such as natural gas distribution; extensive testing and research required by large natural gas distribution customers takes an extended period of time before such potential customers place firm orders; macro-economic issues in the natural gas industry may slow or impede capital expenditures; registration, regulatory approvals, certifications and licensing requirements in foreign countries.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our strategy has been to establish market acceptance and credibility with potential customers through a campaign of product exposure and disclosure of highly acceptable test results of recognized international testing laboratories along with industry seminars, conventions, trade shows, professional periodicals and public relations.
1108967_18_ITEM1A_P110_S1	While we believe that the base has been laid for substantial sales of our GasPT device over the next several years, there is no assurance that our strategy and efforts will be successful.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	During September 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Properties, LLC, signed closing documents on the purchase of our Tualatin, Oregon corporate office real estate located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue in the Tualatin Franklin Business Park.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition to the corporate office, the property also includes the Company s warehouse facility for CUI Inc.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	The purchase price for this acquisition was $5.1 million and was partially funded by a promissory note payable to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $3.7 million plus interest at the rate of 2.0% above LIBOR, payable over ten years.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In January 2015, the Company entered into a three-year lease for our 13,175 square foot Houston facility.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	In November 2017, the Company relocated to a larger rented office and warehouse space in Houston, TX, of approximately 40,000 square feet that runs until 2022.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	In March 2015, as part of the Tectrol (CUI-Canada) acquisition, the Company leased a 73,700 square foot manufacturing facility in Toronto, Canada that runs until 2020.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	In September 2015, Orbital completed the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility on its existing site in the UK to supplement existing office space.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	This enhanced onsite facility enabled the Company to not renew its lease on an additional building it was leasing for manufacturing and office space requirements.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	Additionally, CUI Japan has leased space in Tokyo, Japan, which is used as a sales office and is leased through March 2020.
1108967_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	The Company has enough manufacturing and office capacity to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.
1108967_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are not parties in any legal proceedings.

1108967_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	CUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Company s principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	While all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, management recorded a $2 thousand impairment for a patent within the Power and Electromechanical segment as the Company chose not to continue pursuit of the related patent grants and a $2 thousand impairment of its capitalized website costs for its Japan site after choosing to translate its U.S.-based website into Japanese.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company s qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2017, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The Company performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2017, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill at that time.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Under current accounting guidance, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2017 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to previously forecasted results and a decline in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	To test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the fourth quarter of 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The remaining goodwill related to the Orbital-UK reporting unit as of December 31, 2017 was $4.5 million, which is included in the Energy segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	As of December 31, 2017, there was also goodwill remaining for CUI Inc., CUI-Canada and CUI-Japan reporting units, which are included in the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2016 and 2015, the analysis, determined there was no impairment necessary to goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Through these reviews, management concluded there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with current accounting guidance.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	On a periodic basis, we will also perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and in 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and concluded no impairment of goodwill was required.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	No. 718 ( FASB ASC 718 ), Compensation Stock Compensation.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Stock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	With regards to expected volatility, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflect the expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Each of these methods may produce a different result.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Product revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company sells to distributors pursuant to distribution agreements that have certain terms and conditions such as the right of return and price protection, which inhibit revenue recognition unless they can be reasonably estimated as we cannot assert the price is fixed and determinable and estimate returns.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	For one distributor that comprises 26% of revenue, we have such history and ability to estimate and therefore recognized revenue upon sale to the distributor and record a corresponding reserve for the estimated returns.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	For three other distributor arrangements that represents a combined 15% of revenue, we recognize revenue on a sell-through basis, and accordingly defer revenue and the related costs until such time as the distributor resells the product.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	For production-type contracts meeting the Company s minimum threshold, revenues and related costs on the contracts, are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts ( ASC 605-35 ).
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	The Company captures certain job costs as work progresses, including labor, material and costs not invoiced.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	Margin adjustments are made as information pertaining to contracts changes.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P27_S6	The amount of costs not invoiced is captured to ensure an estimated margin consistent with that expected at the completion of the project.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	In the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company recognizes the loss when it is determined.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Contract costs plus recognized profits are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received are recorded to a deferred revenue liability account.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	The net of these two accounts for any individual project is presented as Costs in excess of billings, an asset account, or Billings in excess of costs, a liability account.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Production type contracts that do not qualify for use of the percentage of completion method are accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35-25-57.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Under this method, contract costs are accumulated as deferred assets, and billings and/or cash received is recorded to a deferred revenue liability account, during the periods of construction, but no revenues, costs, or profits are recognized in operations until the period within which completion of the contract occurs.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	A contract is considered complete when all costs except insignificant items have been incurred; the equipment is operating according to specifications and has been accepted by the customer.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	For product sales in the Energy segment, revenue is recognized in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2017, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $12.6 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand, the October 2017 equity raise and short-term credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	There was a use of cash from operations of approximately $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	This was an increase from the use of cash from operations of approximately $0.6 million and approximately $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2017 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was negatively affected by a larger net loss attributable to the Energy segment and the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments in both the Energy and Power and Electromechanical Segments.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	During 2017, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable and accounts payable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases of approximately $0.4 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects, $0.5 million related to the change in deposits and other assets due to the increase in long-term prepaid royalties at Orbital-UK, $0.4 million use of cash related to changes in accrued expenses primarily due to a change in accrued compensation in the Energy segment and a $0.4 million use of cash from changes in prepaid assets that affected all three segments.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $0.3 million source of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $2.7 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	On a segment basis, in 2017, the Power and Electromechanical segment contributed cash from operations of approximately $3.9 million while the Energy segment used cash of approximately $8.4 million and the Other category used cash of approximately $4.9 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Energy segment was hampered by the continued costs of building brand awareness in North America and a regulatory issue in Italy unrelated to the technology that delayed the next phase of a significant GasPT project through 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Company expects the project to resume in 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	The customer is currently working with its regulatory body to implement a program that would improve its ability to more rapidly deploy the new metering solutions.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe cash from operations will improve in the Energy segment in 2018 due to the expected resumption of the Italian project and growth in the North American business.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	As the North American Orbital business matures, this operation is expected to contribute cash and earnings, but not in the short term.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Power and Electromechanical segment is expected to continue to provide cash from operations and we believe the cash usage rate in the Other category to continue to be stable at the new lower level due to cost cutting initiatives put in place during 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	CUI-Canada s and Orbital-UK s cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. continued to use more cash than it produced due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	During 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $1.3 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and unearned revenue increased $1.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Negative cash flow in 2015 from operations of $6.2 million was significantly affected by operating requirements from Orbital Gas Systems North America and CUI-Canada during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2015 before non-cash expenses as well as changes in assets and liabilities.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	During 2015, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included the increased receivables of approximately $3.3 million with $1.4 million of it due to credit sales generated following the opening of Orbital Gas Systems North America and the acquisition of CUI-Canada coupled with increased sales volume and the timing of deliveries and related sales terms across the Company.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Cash used for inventory purchases increased approximately $3.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Additionally, the cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximate $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets associated largely with prepaid insurance premiums, product purchases, royalties and consulting services fees.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Also, changes in costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost were a combined approximate $2.9 million use of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	The overall use in operating cash was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of approximately $2.1 million primarily due to the timing of goods receipts and the related terms along with the increase due to the addition of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and CUI-Canada.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	Accrued expenses increased $1.8 million related largely to an increase in accrued compensation.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	Unearned revenue increased $2.2 million primarily in relation to increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	For years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a total of $0.4 million, $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were due to lower stock-based bonuses and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	During the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, CUI Global invested $0.9 million, $0.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in fixed assets.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The 2015 investments in property and equipment included the construction of a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing/administration/research and development facility in the UK to supplement existing office space at Orbital.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2018 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	CUI Global invested $0.6 million, $0.9 million, and $0.1 million in other intangible assets during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	Investments in 2017 primarily related to product certifications in the Power and Electromechanical segment and investments in software in the Energy segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	The increased investments in 2016 were due to an increase in product certifications and an ongoing ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company did not invest in short-term investments classified as held to maturity and did not receive any money from maturities in 2017 or 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	In 2015, the Company received $11.1 million from maturities of these investments.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	These investments included money market securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Investments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company s Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which included the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration and had a balance of $45 thousand at December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	See Note 4 Acquisitions, for more information on the Tectrol acquisition.

1108967_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	These proceeds were paid back during 2017 and the balances on each of these credit facilities was zero at December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company filed an S-3 registration statement on March 14, 2017 containing a prospectus that was effective March 29, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	With this filing, CUI Global may from time to time issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants, up to an aggregate amount of $100 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	On October 23, 2017, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering of 7,392,856 shares at a public offering price of $2.80 per share, including 964,285 shares sold at the public offering price pursuant to the underwriter s exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The net proceeds to CUI Global (after deducting underwriting discount and other expenses payable by the Company) were approximately $18.9 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company has used and intends to continue to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily for general corporate purposes, which includes operating expenses, working capital to improve and promote its commercially available products, advance product candidates, future acquisitions or share repurchases, to expand international presence and commercialization, for general capital expenditures and for satisfaction of debt obligations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	In 2017, the Company used some of the proceeds of the public offering to pay off its line of credit and overdraft facility.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	As the Company focuses on strategic acquisitions, technology development, product line additions, developing CUI-Canada operations, and developing Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., it will fund these activities together with related sales and marketing efforts for its various product offerings with cash on hand, including proceeds from the October 2017 issuances through the S-3 registration statement, and available debt.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	CUI Global may raise additional capital needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations.

1108967_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company continued to use cash at Orbital Gas Systems North America in Houston while the CUI-Canada operation was more fully integrated into the Company s Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	As expected in the two years following two major additions, along with an ongoing focus on research and development and growth initiatives, cash usage was greater than what it will be when the businesses are fully mature.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The net cash used in operating activities increased to $9.4 million from $0.6 million in 2016 with much of that due to the ongoing efforts to grow the current businesses as well as the effects of the delay in the major GasPT project in Italy and overall economic effects of Brexit and the transition in the UK, which has resulted in considerable delays in economic activities in the UK.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note has a balance at December 31, 2017 of $3.4 million due, of which $94 thousand is the current portion.

1108967_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Inc. renewed its two-year revolving Line of Credit (LOC) with Wells Fargo Bank in the principal amount of $6.0 million line of credit, until June 1, 2019 with a scheduled decrease in the LOC limit to $4.0 million as of January 1, 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	On October 5, 2016, Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. signed a five-year agreement with the London branch of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. for a multi-currency variable rate overdraft facility with a facility limit of 1.5 million pounds sterling ($2.0 million at December 31, 2017) that expires on October 5, 2021.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	See Note 10 Working Capital Line of Credit and Overdraft Facility for more information on these two credit facilities.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents balances of $12.6 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).
1108967_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts, $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following tables present our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:
1108967_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	(1) The interest on notes payable includes fixed interest on the related party note payable to IED, Inc. and does not include the variable interest on the mortgage payable.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	For further information regarding notes payable see Note 9 Notes Payable.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $108.6 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company expects the revenues from its Power and Electromechanical and Energy Segments, cash on hand, and cash available from line of credit and overdraft facility to cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operation in Houston to continue to need cash support until it can firmly establish itself.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment acquired in 2015 will also continue to be near break even in the short-term.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	If revenues and other funds are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, contain certain financial information regarding revenue and costs by segment:
1108967_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Revenues in 2017 are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were lower than in 2016 due to lower revenues in our Energy segment associated with the timing of customer project delivery schedules and a regulatory issue in Italy unrelated to the technology that delayed the next phase of that project through 2017 as well as lower translated revenue at our UK operations due to the lower value British pound Sterling following Brexit.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	The value of the British pound Sterling began a slow recovery after bottoming out in the first quarter of 2017 and was no longer a negative factor in the fourth quarter as compared to 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Italian contract is still in place and the Company announced in October 2017 that the tariff issue has been resolved and the Company expects deliveries to resume in 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	Partially offsetting the decrease in the Energy segment, was an increase in revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the timing of customer delivery schedules and sell through activity at distributors.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	The customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, distribution channel sales, and the addition in March 2015 of the products from CUI-Canada.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	In October 2017, the Company announced its first order for its new power monitoring and switching system (ICE Switch) for data centers that is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2018.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $20.2 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million at December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	At December 31, 2017, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.6 million compared to approximately $12.1 million at December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	CUI Inc. introduced 1,122 new products during the year ended 2017 compared to 968 new products during the year ended 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The continued product expansion including ICE products, and moving smaller sales through the distribution channel is expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI s sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued new product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Revenues in 2016 were attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Net revenues in 2016 were generally consistent compared to 2015 but would have been more significantly improved except for lower translated Orbital-UK operations as a result of falling foreign currency rates in the UK following the Brexit vote.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	However, the lower rates did not have a significant effect on operating or net income.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $19.7 million as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	At December 31, 2016, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.1 million compared to approximately $12.5 million as of December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2016, the Energy segment s Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. subsidiary completed its first full year of operations and made progress on its goals of self-sustainability with four consecutive quarters of revenue growth.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	CUI Inc. introduced 968 new products during the year ended 2016 compared to 838 new products during the year ended 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 67% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 63% during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	The increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to a less favorable product mix particularly in the Energy segment in 2017 including a decreased volume of higher margin GasPT sales.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The Power and Electromechanical segment also had a slight decrease in its gross margin associated with product mix.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	As a result of the less favorable product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased 11 percentage points from 58% to 69%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	Cost of sales in the Energy segment were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales volumes.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	The percentage of cost of sales for the Power and Electromechanical segment increased from 65% to 66%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	In addition to the increased cost of sales percentage, costs of sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment increased due to higher sales volume in 2017 compared to 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P75_S7	The Company expects improved cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in 2018 as a result of increased sales of higher margin products including GasPT.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 63% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to the offsetting factors of improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment, which were offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 5 percentage points from 63% to 58%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	This improvement helped to offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment s cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 65% from 63%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) expenses includes such items as wages, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, SG A decreased $0.3 million compared to the prior-year comparative period.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The decrease for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in 2016 in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to severance costs in 2017 primarily in the Energy segment that were less than $0.3 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The increase in the Energy segment is due to the severance costs at Orbital-UK and increased advertising expense in the Energy segment of $0.2 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	The remaining decreases in SG A during the year ended December 31, 2017 were associated with various cost saving measures begun in the second quarter of 2017 and due to the lower sales volume in 2017 compared to 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	SG A increased to 41% of total revenue in 2017 compared to 40% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, SG A increased $1.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Increased audit and accounting fees in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $0.7 million, included in the Other category contributed to the increased SG A. Partially offsetting the increased SG A for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a $0.3 million decrease in non-severance-related SG A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	The remaining increases in SG A during the year ended December 31, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE, and new product introductions partially offset by foreign currency translation decreases at Orbital-UK.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P79_S4	SG A increased to 40% of total revenue compared to 38% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company anticipates the amount of sales and marketing expenditures and general and administrative expenses will improve from the 2017 levels following cost saving measures implemented during the year.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The above table includes $0.7 million, $0.5 million, and $0.3 million of depreciation and amortization, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively that was included in cost of sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment and less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales in the Energy segment in 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Depreciation and amortization increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the comparable period in 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2017, which was partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization at Orbital-UK due to generally lower foreign currency rates in 2017 compared to 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Depreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 as the intangible asset associated with the order backlog acquired with Orbital-UK was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2015 and UK assets were depreciated at lower foreign currency rates in 2016 compared to 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2016 and the purchase of CUI-Canada in March 2015, which meant that 2016 had two more months of CUI-Canada depreciation and amortization than in 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	The research and development costs are related to the various technologies for which CUI Global has acquired licensing rights or is developing internally.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The expenditures for research and development have been directed primarily towards the further development of advanced power technologies including ICE technology, AMT Capacitive Encoders and towards the development of the GasPT and VE technologies.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Company expects that 2018 research and development expenses will be consistent with 2017 as the Company continues to expand its product offering and technologies due to market acceptance and customer integration.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2017, management calculated an excess carrying amount for its Orbital-UK goodwill resulting in a $3.2 million impairment.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	See Critical Accounting Policies - Indefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets for more information on the impairment calculation.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	(Credit to) provision for bad debt in 2017, 2016 and 2015 represents less than % of total revenues and relates to miscellaneous receivables, which the Company has either recorded an allowance for doubtful collections of the receivable or for which the Company has determined the balance to be uncollectible.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Credits to the provision for bad debt are generated when aged receivables are collected at a higher rate than was previously reserved for.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	This results in the calculated reserve being reduced.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Company recognized investment income on equity investment in an affiliate of $0 in both 2017 and 2016, and $53 thousand for the first nine months of 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The Company discontinued the equity method of accounting for its investment as of October 1, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	The Company recorded $18 thousand of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $19 thousand of interest income from the note in the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S6	Management reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2017 and concluded that no allowance was necessary.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P87_S7	For more information on this investment, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment and Note Receivable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million of interest expense during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and line of credit and overdraft facility.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	A slight increase in 2017 was due primarily to the increased use of the Company s short-term credit facilities prior to the Company s public issuance of stock in October 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company s U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is more likely than not.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	In 2017, a net benefit of $1.6 million, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.3% compared to a $38 thousand tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and an effective tax rate of (0.5)%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses and the $0.9 million benefit resulting from the rate changes passed in the December 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P89_S5	See Note 16 Income Taxes, for more information on the effects of the December 2017 Tax Act.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $62.2 million, $57.2 million, and $5.0 million, respectively, and for which the federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2019 and 2037.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In 2016, a net expense of $38 thousand, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.5%) compared to a $0.4 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an effective tax rate of 6.4%.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on profitable foreign jurisdictions.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company had a net loss of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2017 was primarily the result of lower revenues coupled with increased cost of revenues due to a less favorable product mix in 2017 compared to 2016, and an impairment to goodwill of $3.2 million.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company had a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2016 was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses, and increased tax expense.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	The Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1108967_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Information on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The following sections provide quantitative information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company conducts operations in four principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., UK, Canadian and Japanese operations, respectively.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Cash is managed centrally within each of the four regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Revenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, the U.S., UK, Canada and Japan.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	(1) On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Tectrol, Inc. (CUI-Canada) which was effective March 1, 2015, see Note 4 Acquisitions.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments.
1108967_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia , provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield.

1108967_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	CUI Global Inc. (CUI Global) is a platform company composed of two segments, the Power and Electromechanical segment and the Energy segment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment is made up of the wholly owned subsidiaries: CUI Inc. (CUI), based in Tualatin, Oregon; CUI Japan, based in Tokyo, Japan; and CUI-Canada, based in Toronto, Canada.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	All three subsidiaries are providers of power and electromechanical components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Power and Electromechanical segment defines its product offerings into two categories: power solutions , which consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters, and advanced power solutions including the ICE products, and components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, and control solutions including encoders and sensors.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as consumer electronics, medical and defense.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company s Energy segment is made up of Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. (Orbital-UK) and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (Orbital North America), collectively referred to as Orbital.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	This business segment was formed when in April 2013, CUI Global acquired 100% of the capital stock of Orbital-UK, a United Kingdom-based provider of natural gas infrastructure and advanced technology, including metering, odorization, remote telemetry units ( RTU ) and a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	In January 2015, CUI Global formed and opened Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P10_S3	a wholly owned subsidiary, to represent the Energy segment in the North American market.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P10_S4	GasPT and VE Technology products are sold through Orbital.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenues at CUI Global consisted of 77% from the Power and Electromechanical segment and 23% from the Energy segment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company s goodwill, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P12_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CUI Global, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CUI Inc., CUI Japan, CUI-Canada (included since March 1, 2015), CUI Properties, LLC, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. hereafter referred to as the Company.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Level 1 Pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted for similar assets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Level 2 includes assets or liabilities valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities; that is, the inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company determines when a financial instrument transfers between levels based on management s judgment of the significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the financial instrument.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Management believes the carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs in excess of billings, prepaid expense and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, billings in excess of costs, unearned revenue, and other liabilities reflected in the accompanying balance sheet approximate fair value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	Mortgage debt and related notes payable approximate fair value based on current market conditions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company measures its derivative liability on a recurring basis using significant observable inputs (Level 2).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company s derivative liability is valued using a LIBOR swap curve.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Cash includes deposits at financial institutions with maturities of three months or less.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits and places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S3	Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S4	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions that were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P21_S5	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Test Products International, Inc. ( TPI ) is a provider of handheld test and measurement equipment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Through the acquisition of CUI Inc., the Company obtained 352,589 common shares (representing an 8.94% interest from January 1 to March 31, 2014 and 8.5% thereafter).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Through September 30, 2015, CUI Global enjoyed a close association with TPI through common related parties, IED, Inc. and James McKenzie as well as through participation that allowed for a significant amount of influence over TPI s business decisions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Accordingly, through September 30, 2015, for financial statement purposes, the Company recognized its investment in TPI under the equity method.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Subsequent to September 30, 2015, CUI Global and its common related parties were unable to obtain a timely financial report, which was inconsistent with prior periods, evidencing a reduction in the influence of CUI Global over TPI.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Based on this change in influence, and CUI Global s level of technical control through its 8.5% equity interest, management determined that effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that CUI Global no longer had significant influence over TPI.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	Accordingly, the Company s investment in TPI was accounted for under the cost method in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S3	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S4	The Company recorded $18 thousand and $19 thousand of interest income from the note for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S5	The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S6	Finders-fee royalties of $16 thousand and $37 thousand were earned by TPI in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and offset against the note receivable quarterly.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S7	The Company also received $39 thousand in cash payments against the note in the year ended December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P24_S8	CUI Global reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2017 and concluded that no allowance was necessary.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Presented below are the equity method earnings through nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is the final period that CUI Global had significant influence over TPI:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the receivables associated with revenue derived from product sales including present amounts due to contracts accounted for under percentage of completion method.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	An allowance for uncollectible accounts is recorded to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, based on an analysis of prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Based on management s review of accounts receivable, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is considered adequate.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P26_S3	The reserve in both periods considers aged receivables that management believes should be specifically reserved for as well as historic experience with bad debts to determine the total reserve appropriate for each period.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P26_S4	Receivables are determined to be past due based on the payment terms of original invoices.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company grants credit to its customers, with standard terms of Net 30 days.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	Additionally, the Company maintains a foreign credit receivables insurance policy that covers many of the CUI Inc. foreign customer receivable balances in effort to further reduce credit risk exposure.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventories consist of finished and unfinished products and are stated at the lower of cost or market through either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as a cost flow convention or through the moving average cost method.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	At December 31, 2017, and 2016, inventory is presented on the balance sheet net of reserves.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company provides reserves for inventories estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company s estimation process for assessing the net realizable value is based upon its known backlog, projected future demand, historical usage and expected market conditions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Manufactured inventory includes material, labor and overhead.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Activity in inventory reserves is as follows:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	During the second quarter of 2017, prepaid royalties in the amount of $1.6 million were transferred to long-term and included in Deposits and other assets from prepaid expenses due to a change in the estimated period of when those prepayments will be amortized based upon management s assessment of future GasPT sales.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	There was $1.8 million of prepaid royalties included in Deposits and other assets at December 31, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Land is recorded at cost and includes expenditures made to ready it for use.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Land is considered to have an infinite useful life.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Buildings and improvements are recorded at cost.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Furniture, vehicles, and equipment are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term, estimated useful life, or ten years.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The cost of buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The estimated useful lives for buildings, improvements, furniture, vehicles, and equipment are as follows:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expenses when incurred.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	When furniture, vehicles and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from this account, and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Long-lived assets including finite-lived identifiable assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	In performing the review for recoverability, the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are estimated.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P44_S5	Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortization and impairment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	The fair value for intangible assets acquired through acquisitions is measured at the time of acquisition utilizing the following inputs, as needed:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quote prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities if available.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	This includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full life of the asset.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Expert appraisal and fair value measurement as completed by third-party experts.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The following are the estimated useful life for the intangible assets:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Technology rights are amortized over a 20-year life or the term of the rights agreement.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Software assets are recorded at cost and include major expenditures, which increase productivity or substantially increase useful lives.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Patents are amortized over the life of the patent.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Any patents not approved will be expensed at that time.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Other intangible assets are amortized over an appropriate useful life, as determined by management in relation to the other intangible asset characteristics.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment and when circumstances suggest.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from the acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company tests for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company s qualitative assessment of impairment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2017, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at May 31, 2017, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill at that time.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Under current accounting guidance, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill, management completes a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	To complete this review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the intangibles and goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2017 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to previously forecasted results and a decline in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	To test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P62_S4	The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the fourth quarter of 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The remaining goodwill related to the Orbital-UK reporting unit as of December 31, 2017 was $4.5 million, which is included in the Energy segment.

1108967_18_ITEM8_P115_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P115_S3	The standard was originally effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional note disclosures).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P115_S4	On July 9, 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P115_S5	After evaluating the transition options, the Company has chosen to implement using the modified retrospective method.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The cumulative effect adjustment to be recorded as of January 1, 2018 is expected to be approximately a net $1.9 million decrease to accumulated deficit due to an approximate $2.8 million from the Power and Electromechanical segment transition adjustment partially offset by a $0.9 million from the Energy segment transition adjustment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	Certain Power and Electromechanical revenue recorded as sell through under previous guidance will be recorded at the time of sale net of appropriate reserves consistent with other sales in the Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Energy segment transition adjustment is due to certain production-type contracts that lacked a specific enforceable right to payment for revenue recorded using percentage of completion method under the previous guidance.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	These contracts typically contained termination clauses based on milestones that were not deemed specific enough to warrant revenue recognition over time under the new guidance.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company s fair value hierarchy for its cash equivalents, marketable securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, was as follows:
1108967_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	There were no transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 in 2017 as determined at the end of the reporting period.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	The contingent consideration liability is associated with the acquisition of Tectrol in March 2015 and represents the present value of the expected future contingent payment based on revenue projections of select Tectrol legacy products.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The inputs used to measure contingent consideration are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The valuation is not supported by market criteria and reflects the Company s internal revenue forecasts.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P121_S2	Since the valuation is not supported by market criteria, the valuation is completely dependent on unobservable inputs.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	During quarterly updates of the valuation, the calculation of the value is based on actual and reasonably estimated future revenues.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	Based on the Company s fourth quarter 2017 analysis, the Company adjusted the current value of the contingent consideration based on updated revenue projections.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The fair values of the reporting units subject to the Company s quantitative impairment analysis were determined utilizing a blend of a market and an income approach to determine the estimated fair values of the reporting units, as discussed in Note 2.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The fair value measurements and models were classified as non-recurring Level 3 measurements.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	On March 5, 2015, the Company closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc., a Toronto, Canada corporation.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	The acquisition was effective March 1, 2015 and is included from that date in the Company s Power and Electromechanical segment.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	As a part of this acquisition strategy, CUI Global, Inc. formed a wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, CUI-Canada, Inc., to receive these acquired assets and liabilities.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	That entity entered into a five-year lease of the Toronto facility where Tectrol, Inc. was operating its business.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	CUI-Canada, Inc. operations include the design and manufacture assembly of electronic power conversion devices such as AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC power supplies, linear power supplies and uninterruptable power supplies.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	The purchase price for the acquisition of the assets was $5.2 million subject to good faith adjustments by the parties according to the final value of the non-obsolete inventory conveyed and other closing adjustments.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	In addition, the agreement calls for an earn-out/royalty payment of two percent of the gross sales (for specific, identified customers) over a period of three years from the closing date, up to a maximum of $0.3 million that may or may not be paid to the seller within 90 days of each calendar year-end, depending on performance by the identified customer(s).
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	The final adjusted purchase price for the acquisition of Tectrol was $4.5 million, which included the present value of $0.3 million of royalties to be paid on future sales, which was recorded as $0.2 million of contingent consideration.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S3	At December 31, 2017, $45 thousand of contingent consideration is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S4	The full purchase price less the contingent consideration was paid in cash.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P126_S5	The Company funded the consideration paid to the shareholder of Tectrol with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from short-term investments that had matured.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
1108967_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

1108967_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	Since the maturity date is June 1, 2019, which is more than one year in the future, the LOC is classified as long-term.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P41_S2	The board discusses with the Company s outside general counsel, as appropriate, its risk oversight and assessment as well as any material risks to the Company.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P42_S3	This enables the board and its committees to coordinate the risk management, assessment and oversight roles.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P48_S0	We believe that it is important that stockholders understand our governance practices.
1108967_18_ITEM10_P48_S1	In order to help ensure transparency of our practices, we have posted information regarding our corporate governance procedures on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P62_S3	In general, when the board determines that expansion of the board or replacement of a director is necessary or appropriate, the nominating committee will review, through candidate interviews with members of the board and management, consultation with the candidate s associates and through other means, a candidate s honesty, integrity, reputation in and commitment to the community, judgment, personality and thinking style, willingness to invest in the Company, residence, willingness to devote the necessary time, potential conflicts of interest, independence, understanding of financial statements and issues, and the willingness and ability to engage in meaningful and constructive discussion regarding Company issues.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P86_S0	Our Compensation Committee meets formally and informally as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities.

1108967_18_ITEM10_P89_S0	Our Compensation Committee Charter is posted on our website at www.CUIGlobal.com.
1108967_18_ITEM10_P90_S0	None of the members of the Company s Compensation Committee is or has at any time during the last completed fiscal year been an officer or employee of the Company.
1108967_18_ITEM10_P90_S1	None of the Company s executive officers has served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who served on the Company s board of directors or Compensation Committee during the last completed fiscal year.
1108967_18_ITEM10_P91_S0	We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the proxy statement on Schedule 14A for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P0_S0	Our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P0_S1	Following this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire to link pay with performance, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual contributions, teamwork and performance, each executive s total compensation package and internal pay equity.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P0_S2	We strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all employees with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P1_S0	At the core of our compensation philosophy is our strong belief that pay should be directly linked to performance.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P1_S1	We believe in a pay for performance culture that places a significant portion of executive officer total compensation as contingent upon, or variable with, individual performance, Company performance and achievement of strategic goals including increasing shareholder value.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P2_S0	The performance based compensation for our executives may be in the form of (i) annual cash incentives to promote achievement of, and accountability for, shorter term performance plans and strategic goals and (ii) equity grants, designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return over a multiple year performance cycle.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P2_S1	Long-term incentive equity awards are typically granted in restricted stock or stock options.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P2_S2	These awards generally vest over a two to four-year period.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P3_S0	This opportunity for share ownership was to provide incentive and retain key employees and align their interests with our long-term strategic goals.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P4_S0	A key component of an executive s total compensation base salary is designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities, sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P4_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	Management plays a significant role in the compensation-setting process.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P5_S1	The most significant aspects of management s role are:
1108967_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	assistance in preparing agenda and materials for the Committee meetings.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Chief Executive Officer generally attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also regularly meets in executive session.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P7_S1	The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with respect to financial and corporate goals and objectives and makes non-CEO executive compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on Company performance, individual performance and the peer group compensation market analysis.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Compensation Committee considers and deliberates on this information and in turn makes recommendations to the board of directors, for the board s determination and approval of the executives and other members of senior management s compensation, as necessary, including base compensation, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P7_S3	For related party employee matters, appropriate personnel meet with the Compensation Committee to determine compensation and incentives and to review ongoing performance of the employee.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P7_S4	The Chief Executive Officer s performance and compensation is reviewed, evaluated and established separately by the Compensation Committee and ratified and approved by the board of directors.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	To evaluate whether total compensation is competitive and provides appropriate rewards to attract and retain talented leaders, as discussed above, we may rely on analyses of peer companies performed by independent compensation consultants and on other industry and occupation specific survey data available.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P8_S1	Our general benchmark is to establish both base salary and total compensation for the executive officers at or near the compensation of peer group data, recognizing that a significant portion of executive officer total compensation should be contingent upon, or variable with, achievement of individual and Company performance objectives and strategic goals, as well as being variable with stockholder value.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P8_S2	Further, while the objective for base salary is at that of peer group data, executives base salaries are designed to reward core competencies and contributions to the Company and may be increased above this general benchmark based on (i) the individual s increased contribution over the preceding year; (ii) the individual s increased responsibilities over the preceding year; and (iii) any increase in median competitive pay levels.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	The Company s business plans and strategic objectives are generally presented by management annually and as needed to the board of directors.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P9_S1	The board engages in an active discussion concerning the financial targets, the appropriateness of the strategic objectives and the difficulty in achieving the same.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	In establishing the compensation plan, our Compensation Committee then utilizes the primary financial objectives from the adopted business plan and operating cash flow as the primary targets for determining the executive officers short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentive compensation.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee also establishes additional non-financial performance goals and objectives, the achievement of which is required for funding of a significant portion, approximately twenty five percent, of the executive officers incentive compensation.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P10_S2	In 2017, these non-financial performance goals and objectives included among other factors, the continued growth of the Orbital Gas Systems, North America operations; continued integration of CUI-Canada; continued expansion within the global natural gas market, expansion of distribution and direct customer relationships through CUI Inc.; continued product development and new product introductions including the ICE technology and various VE technology-based sample systems; and general and administrative management responsibilities.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P10_S3	In addition, such factors as revenue growth; new product adoption; market penetration; M A activities; and investment banking transactions were and are considered in setting compensation levels.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Chief Executive Officer recommends the actual incentive award amounts for all other executives based on actual Company performance relative to the targets set as well as on individual performance and recommends the executives base salary levels.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations generally following the end of each fiscal year in determining its recommendations to the board of directors for the final short-term cash incentive and long-term equity award amounts for each executive.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	Executive base salary levels are reviewed in accordance with their respective employment agreements.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	The actual incentive amounts awarded to each executive are ultimately subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the board of directors.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, under t he Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, t he Compensation Committee considers the prior year shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as appropriate for making compensation decisions.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P13_S1	At the annual meeting of shareholders held December 1, 2017, more than 79% percent of the shareholders present and voting on the proposal approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation disclosed in the Company s proxy statement for the meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 5, 2017.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P13_S2	As a result, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company s shareholders were supportive of the Company s executive compensation philosophy, policies and programs and the Compensation Committee will continue to reach out to shareholders regarding compensation matters.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P13_S3	The Compensation Committee determined to continue such philosophy, policies and programs, with such updates and modifications as appropriate for changing circumstances.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	Additional equity-based awards may also be granted to executives, as well as other employees, upon commencement of employment, promotions, for special performance recognition or for retention purposes, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	In determining whether to recommend additional grants to an executive, the Chief Executive Officer typically considers the individual s performance and any planned change in functional responsibility.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	Total compensation for our executives consists of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive cash award based on achieving specific performance targets as measured by revenues, cash flow and other objectives and (iii) equity incentive award, which is also performance based and may be paid out over a future period in the form of stock, restricted stock or stock purchase options.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	Base salaries are the value upon which both the incentive compensation percentage targets are measured against.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	For evaluation and comparison of overall compensation of the executives and to assist it in making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews an executive compensation summary, which sets forth for each executive: current compensation and current equity ownership holdings as well as the projected value of each and all such compensation elements, including distributions and dividends therefrom.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P18_S1	Also included in the summary are comparative performance numbers, specific milestones, strategic objectives, and other elements used to measure each executive s individual performance.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	Base salaries are designed to compensate executives commensurate with their respective level of experience, scope of responsibilities and to reward sustained individual performance and future potential.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P19_S1	The goal has been to provide for base salaries that are sufficiently competitive with other similar-sized companies, both regionally and nationally, to attract and retain talented leaders.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	Incentive compensation is intended to align compensation with business objectives and performance and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward high quality executive officers whose contributions are critical to both the short and long-term success of the Company.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P20_S1	The executives incentive awards are based upon three key performance metrics: (i) the Company s earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization (EBIDTA); (ii) achievement of agreed-upon strategic and corporate performance goals; and/or (iii) existing Employment Agreement.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	The strategic and corporate performance goals are not intended to be a specific agreed-upon goal, but rather a general objective.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P21_S1	Management and the board of directors discuss these factors and set objectives that are dynamic and change periodically.
1108967_18_ITEM11_P21_S2	In setting these periodic goals, the board of directors discusses with management the nature of the objective and management s proposed method of achieving the goal.
